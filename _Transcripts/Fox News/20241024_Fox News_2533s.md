# Fox News Highlights - Oct. 23, 2024
**Fox News:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c)
*  The Ingram Angle from Washington tonight, as always, thank you for spending some time with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=0.0s)]
*  Thirteen days out and while top polls show the race is extremely tight and very difficult to predict, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=5.44s)]
*  there are some undeniable trend lines in Trump's favor. Now even as Harris has a massive money [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=11.76s)]
*  advantage, we see this from The Economist. Donald Trump takes the lead as polls swing away from [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris. Now Harris has dropped 10 points in the survey from just a week ago and Trump, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=24.24s)]
*  he surged by 10 on the other side. And Harris is only up in two swing states, Michigan and Nevada, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  according to Bloomberg. Trump leads in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=38.0s)]
*  And last night for a moment, it seemed even Obama was feeling it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=45.2s)]
*  I notice my palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy. Heavy? I'm not sure what heavy means, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=49.839999999999996s)]
*  whatever. Of course, like I said, conservatives shouldn't count their chickens. This is still [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=59.76s)]
*  anyone's race. Remember what happened in 2022. A lot of people were disappointed, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=64.08s)]
*  but that doesn't stop Republicans from having a little fun in their minds from dreaming of what [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=69.28s)]
*  they saw eight years ago. Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=73.68s)]
*  Can we find her? I'd like to interview her tonight, if possible. Now as close as things are, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=85.2s)]
*  Democrats may be running out of cards to play. The best they can hope for is that maybe they [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=92.0s)]
*  can juice the female turnout enough to overcome their deficit with other demographic groups, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=97.92000000000002s)]
*  like male voters, Hispanics, black men and young people. And to that I say, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=102.48s)]
*  Kamala's bad for women. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=108.4s)]
*  Well, none of it really seems to be sticking. They tried. Trump's a dictator in waiting. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=114.08s)]
*  They even compared him to Adolf Hitler. Didn't really work. He's going to unleash the Pentagon [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=119.68s)]
*  on us. He is out for unchecked power. That's what he's looking for. He wants to send the military [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=126.48s)]
*  after American citizens. The audience was like, what? None of it's landing, but they keep going [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  negative. Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged and will stop at nothing to claim [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=141.36s)]
*  unchecked power for himself. And yet the lower she sunk with her attacks, well, the lower she sunk [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=152.48s)]
*  in the polls. So now what? Well, now she's turning the page on joy and love to a new chapter of fear [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=160.56s)]
*  and loathing. So from now until election day, Kamala's crew will spend their time and a lot of money [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=168.88s)]
*  scaring and lying to women in order to increase turnout. Now, although this strategy may be your [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=174.64s)]
*  only hope, given some of the trends I mentioned earlier, it's not in the least inspiring, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=180.4s)]
*  nor is it optimistic. It's not what we thought we were getting with Kamala Harris. It's just [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=186.32s)]
*  plain cynical. And coming from Governor Googly eyes, it's plain comical. Think about all of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=190.96s)]
*  the women in your life who you love, daughters, wives, moms, cousins, your neighbors, whatever. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=198.16s)]
*  This election is literally about their lives. Literally. Well, the media also got their [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=203.6s)]
*  marching orders. Women be afraid, be very afraid. If there weren't men like Donald Trump in the world, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=211.2s)]
*  women actually wouldn't require protection. The difference could not be more stark [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  relating to women's reproductive rights. Oh Mitch. Now the most bizarre aspect of their supercharged [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=222.4s)]
*  fair campaign targeting women voters is Kamala's decision to involve a former congresswoman with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=229.6s)]
*  zero following. I was just with one of the the the leaders and I think opinion leaders in the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=236.72s)]
*  Republican Party, Liz Cheney. She is pro-life, but she also understands the pain and the tragedy [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=243.2s)]
*  that has happened since Donald Trump allowed Roe v. Wade to be overturned. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=251.92s)]
*  What tragedy is she talking about? And she's not an opinion leader of the Republican Party. Thank [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=258.0s)]
*  you very much. What the tragedy of more babies being born in states like Alabama, Mississippi, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=262.56s)]
*  Louisiana. This is what the Democrat Party has become where the right to abort one's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=268.0s)]
*  offspring until birth is now their central defining sacrosanct organizing tenant, their dogma. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=274.88s)]
*  But women don't fall for it regardless of where you are on that issue because Harris herself is [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  responsible for bringing the tragedy to America. Economic suffering with inflation meaning young [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=290.48s)]
*  families, young women struggle to buy homes and afford basic necessities. The cost of groceries [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=296.88s)]
*  and gasoline and everything going so high. We live in a fairly rural area. It's the prices that get [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=303.68s)]
*  us. I could not afford daycare. I tried applying for any kind of assistance and was denied. You're [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=309.36s)]
*  like are you going to eat this week or are you going to save money to pay rent? It's a heartbreak. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=315.36s)]
*  And then there's the tragedy of Kamala's open borders. Vicious, brutal crimes committed by [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=321.76s)]
*  illegals against women and girls primarily human trafficking, child sex trafficking. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=328.72s)]
*  We're never going to know the actual number of victims involved, but their cries go unanswered [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=335.68s)]
*  in the Harris campaign, which is why Tim Walz's words are just not believable. She has had one [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  client, the people. She stood up for women and children against predators and abusers. She stood [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=348.16s)]
*  up for families and communities against transnational gangs and traffickers. Traffickers. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=354.96s)]
*  There we are. What a joke. The cartels and the traffickers have been one of the few growth [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=360.0s)]
*  industries under Biden and Harris. And when pressed, Kamala Harris will not apologize [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=364.56s)]
*  for the suffering that her open border has wrought. Jocelyn Nungeri, Rachel Moran, Lakin Riley, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=371.67999999999995s)]
*  they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were released [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  at the beginning of the administration. Do you owe those families an apology? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=384.72s)]
*  Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. There's no question about that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  There is no question about that. You know what I call that? Tragic cases. You know, the feigned, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=396.88000000000005s)]
*  feigned concern. That's camera ready compassion. It's totally phony. And women voters are also [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=404.8s)]
*  mothers and no mother wants to see her son or her daughter get needlessly killed because of an [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=412.8s)]
*  administration's incompetence. Afghanistan was another Biden Harris tragedy. And with Liz Cheney [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  said to be secretary of defense in a Harris administration, moms should prepare for more [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=426.48s)]
*  of their sons and daughters to go off to war because that will be on the agenda and maybe even [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  a draft if things get really bad. And how is this any of this good for women again? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=436.72s)]
*  Women across America, none of the people you're seeing on TV, you're listening to on podcasts [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  really believe that Trump is dangerous. You saw Chuck Schumer hanging out at the Alice [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=450.56s)]
*  Smith dinner with Trump. He thinks Trump's Hitler. I don't think so. And if Trump wins on January [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=454.88000000000005s)]
*  20th, 2025, and he goes into the White House, well, every single member of MSNBC will be back [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=460.8s)]
*  on the air to attack him. Joe Biden will be at the inaugural if he can find it. So will Kamala Harris. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=468.16s)]
*  No high profile celebrities, I'm sorry, will be selling their belongings and moving to Europe. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  Liberals will not go into hiding. It is all a lie and they know it. And smart and savvy women [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=481.2s)]
*  are too cool and too with it to fall for any of this. And that's the angle. The clock is ticking [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=489.2s)]
*  on Kamala Harris, less than two weeks until election day. Democrats are getting prickly [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  about her campaign. Politico says she's running on yesterday and Trump rather than tomorrow in her. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=500.96s)]
*  Kamala still hasn't been able to answer the easiest question. Who are you? She can't tell [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  us because one mistake game over. The election is that close. Holy cow. From a historical [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=513.68s)]
*  perspective, we are heading into the election with the closest polls in the electoral college [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  that we have ever seen at least over the last 50 years. Real clear says the race is too close to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  call. It's the tightest race in over half a century. And the only campaign event Kamala's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=533.52s)]
*  done in the last 48 hours. She stopped at a deli. Democrats are telling each other, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=539.12s)]
*  if this is a vibe election, the current vibes ain't great. And now people are starting to cry. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=556.48s)]
*  As I said, people are very emotional today and a lot of tension in democratic land because [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=563.0400000000001s)]
*  they're behaving as if they're losing. I'm just telling you that's the view of Democrats too, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=571.44s)]
*  not just the media, not just Republicans. Trump's in Georgia tonight with country star Jason Aldean, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=576.96s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr. and Tucker. We're expecting some pyrotechnics tonight. We'll take you there [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=582.72s)]
*  later. So stay tuned. Meanwhile, Democrats are still in the getting to know her phase. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=589.2s)]
*  Kamala wants America to know she's friends with Liz Cheney and the left doesn't like that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  The Cheney thing. Do we really have to do that? Look, I, it goes broader than that. Look, Bernie [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=602.48s)]
*  Sanders, Dick Cheney, Taylor Swift, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=611.76s)]
*  having the Cheney's on board. You can't Dick Cheney or Taylor Swift. No, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=616.24s)]
*  we're a big country. Did Taylor Swift get us to invade? It doesn't mean they agree with it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  We're not going to take their foreign policy decisions and discussions, you know, and implement [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=629.12s)]
*  those. We're going to take their promise. Yes. She sat down with Telemundo and she looked two-faced. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=632.88s)]
*  Watch. Right now we're talking about border security and there's nobody, no Democrat talking [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=641.36s)]
*  about pathway to citizenship and immigration relief and that benefits that migrants bring to [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  this country. Oh, but there's no question that migrants bring. America is a country that was [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=653.2s)]
*  built in part by immigrants who have come. People are concerned about their GPS that they have there. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=663.2s)]
*  We're talking about mass deportations. I'm not talking about. What do you stand on? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=669.84s)]
*  I think what's what's your stand there? We need smart, humane immigration policy in America that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=676.16s)]
*  includes a pathway to citizenship. So she went from tough girl touring the border with agents [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  to mass amnesty. Telemundo had to interrupt her almost as much as Brett Baer. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=693.84s)]
*  Paul suggests that you're having shortcomings with Latinos, specifically with Latino men. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  What do you think that President Donald Trump has been able to to make those gains with Latinos? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=706.0s)]
*  Listen, Donald Trump has, when he was president, had policies that I think have [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=714.0s)]
*  been very harmful to working people. You know, he gave tax cuts to billionaires in the biggest [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=721.6s)]
*  corporations. He will do that again without voice. You're winning with Latino voting, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=727.12s)]
*  not winning, not winning, but you know, winning more voters. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=732.88s)]
*  But this is not my experience. My experience is I talk with Latino voters every day all the time [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=736.64s)]
*  and there is an incredible amount of support there. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=744.4s)]
*  Hmm. Reporters are getting testy with Harris. NBC asked her about taxpayer-funded sex [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=746.72s)]
*  exchanges three times. Still couldn't get an answer. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=753.2s)]
*  I believe we should follow the law. I mean, I think you're probably pointing to the fact that [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=762.32s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars. They're trying to define you on this. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm asking you to define yourself, though. I believe that people, as the law states, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  even on this issue about federal law, that that is a decision that doctors will make in terms of [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=776.96s)]
*  what is medically necessary. I will move on, but I don't know that I heard a clear answer from you [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=782.72s)]
*  on the issue of gender-affirming care. What do you want the LGBTQ plus community to know as they're [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=786.64s)]
*  looking for a full-throated backing from you for trans Americans? I believe that all people should [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=791.2s)]
*  be treated with dignity and respect. Period. Kamala just does what she's told, but she can't say that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=799.28s)]
*  So every answer is as painful for her as it is for you and me. And if she doesn't know [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=808.24s)]
*  where she's going, how is she going to take us with her? His plans will weaken America's economy. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=814.64s)]
*  Why do you think that's not landing with voters? Because the numbers, it's the opposite. Former [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=821.12s)]
*  President Trump leads you on this issue. Well, when I'm out, this is why I'm going out to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=824.72s)]
*  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Excuse me. Just got in late this morning, actually. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=829.52s)]
*  Kamala's calling Trump tired and unfit, but hasn't held a campaign event in two days and [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=837.84s)]
*  can't remember Michigan. Thankfully, the voters know a lot more about Kamala than she does about us. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  What are your feelings, and let me start with the women here, about Kamala Harris. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=849.36s)]
*  I don't think that she has the personality. I don't think that she has what it takes to go up [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=853.44s)]
*  against Putin and go up against these other presidents that are built for this. She don't [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=860.08s)]
*  understand our struggles. And for me to believe you for another four years, you're crazy. Right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=866.08s)]
*  Like you're crazy. You're saying the same thing that you said four years ago. Trump talks about [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=872.32s)]
*  this a lot. He says, you know, Kamala Harris became black when it was convenient. Do you agree with [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=877.0400000000001s)]
*  him on that? Do you feel like she's wearing her blackness? Absolutely. She swore into the Senate, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=882.08s)]
*  it was as the first Indian American. Thank you. It's fine. We don't care. We all know she's not [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=887.5200000000001s)]
*  black. Let's understand that. We are all clear of that. But my point of view, and like I told [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=893.36s)]
*  you earlier, she's already been there. She's in office right now. Shouldn't black women in [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=898.72s)]
*  Philly be ride or die? That should be your base. MSNBC was trying to cherry pick and they still [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=904.64s)]
*  couldn't find any love for Harris. It's gotten so crazy that Barack Obama is now saying Trump's too [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  old. You're going to vote, which means you're going to let a bunch of old people decide [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=918.64s)]
*  your future. You wouldn't do that about your music. You wouldn't do that about your clothes, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=924.88s)]
*  but you're going to let them decide what your future, your potential careers, what the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=930.32s)]
*  environment is going to look like. You're going to let them decide that. And you're not going to be, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  you're just going to opt out. That doesn't make any sense. Barry with the gray hair telling black [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=940.24s)]
*  men not to listen to boomers is kind of funny after he made us listen to Joe Biden for four years, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=946.1600000000001s)]
*  the oldest president of all time. Black men are still sore over the last lecture. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=951.6s)]
*  I was deeply offended and it felt like a moment where it's like you N words, better get in line [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=957.6s)]
*  and do what we say. And it felt like the demo hit him as the czar of the Democratic party coming [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=964.32s)]
*  down to say, go get these N words in line. And the general tone of it was disgusting. It was [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=969.2800000000001s)]
*  abhorrent. I don't respect it. I didn't like nothing about it. Democrats don't care if you're [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=975.0400000000001s)]
*  disrespected, whatever it takes to win. Carville says time to play dirty. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=979.36s)]
*  And I'm really not interested in being very fair about the whole goddamn thing. Okay. I'm [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=985.76s)]
*  really don't think we should have fought fair against the Germans and the Japanese. I think [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  we should have like snuck around them. And I think we should have, you know, going behind him in [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=996.32s)]
*  lines and cut their throats because that was what it was at stake. I think we're literally approaching [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1000.4s)]
*  the same place right now. I'm not talking about everybody's stop. Don't think I'm not talking [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1007.28s)]
*  about actually splitting a political opponent's throat. After Trump survived two assassination [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1012.9599999999999s)]

*  Goldberg at the Atlantic has cooked up a doozy says Trump admired Hitler. There's no recordings [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1033.36s)]
*  of this and everyone says it's bologna, but the VP who swallows hoaxes to go with her word salads [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1039.4399999999998s)]
*  ran to the cameras. It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1045.52s)]
*  invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews and hundreds [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  of thousands of Americans. Donald Trump is someone who I quote, certainly falls into the general [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1062.32s)]
*  definition of fascist who in fact vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1068.56s)]
*  as his personal militia. She was quoting Kelly there. Kamala is asking for trouble. She knows [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1076.32s)]
*  the secret service can barely protect 45. She's playing with fire. She knows it and so's the [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1084.1599999999999s)]
*  White House. So just to be clear when you said we do agree, President Biden believes that Donald [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1091.52s)]
*  Trump is a fascist. I mean yes, we have said, he said himself. The former president has said he is [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1098.0s)]
*  going to be a dictator on day one. We cannot ignore that. So in 24 hours the highest levels of the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  Democrat establishment have called Trump a Nazi who should be locked up and have his throat slit. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1111.2s)]
*  If Donald Trump wins, how are we going to have a peaceful transition? The left is saying Trump's a [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1117.2s)]
*  dictator who's going to turn the military on them. They're just going to hand him the keys to the [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1123.52s)]
*  White House and pretend like he's Mitt Romney. They're not just smearing Trump. They're saying [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1127.52s)]
*  half the country's Hitler. Listen, it doesn't so much matter that Donald Trump is selling fascism. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1133.1200000000001s)]
*  What really matters is that roughly half of Americans, including a clear majority of American [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1139.6s)]
*  men, are buying it. The average American man is saying yes to fascism right now. Why? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1145.1999999999998s)]
*  In the last week they've said American men are sexist fascists, whose only chance of getting [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1152.32s)]
*  lucky in bed is if they vote for Kamala. They're admitting they have Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1158.0s)]
*  I'm an optimistic person. I'm not hysterical. I laugh when people say, oh you've got Trump [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1164.6399999999999s)]
*  derangement syndrome. If you're a reasonable person, you should have Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1170.48s)]
*  Rules for men, Jimmy, listen closely. Men should never let another person make them irrationally [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1177.1200000000001s)]
*  emotional. You don't give someone else power over you. Deep breath, Jimmy. Stoicism. I'll send you a book. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1182.8s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight Kamala Harris is calling for amnesty straight up telling Telemundo [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1191.6s)]
*  that the millions of unvetted Harris Biden illegal immigrants, the ones she allowed into the country, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1198.0s)]
*  should have a pathway to citizenship. Let's take a look. Right now we're talking about border [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1203.8400000000001s)]
*  security and there's nobody, no democrat, talking about pathway to citizenship and immigration [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1209.3600000000001s)]
*  relief and the benefits that migrants bring to this country. Oh but there's no question that [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  migrants bring, America is a country that was built in part by immigrants. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1224.08s)]
*  Forget about respecting laws, borders, sovereignty and I'm sure that if Democrats offer people [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1232.32s)]
*  something of such incredible great value, I'm sure that they're hoping that the recipients of such [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1238.08s)]
*  generosity will be forever grateful and those that give something so amazing. Anyway, we're going to [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1244.8s)]
*  play more of her disastrous Telemundo interview that's straight ahead tonight and later we're [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1252.24s)]
*  going to bring you new details from Missouri where a Democratic Senate candidate accidentally, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1257.1200000000001s)]

*  shooting range. The Missouri Democrat called it quote a great day at the range with my friend [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1268.8s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger. But first early voting is now underway in almost every state. You could say [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1273.52s)]
*  every day for the next 13 days if there's voting going on it is election day so get to the polls, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1279.28s)]
*  take nothing for granted. The margins they are razor thin. The red wave never materialized in [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1285.68s)]
*  2022. There is not one person, let me be very clear about this, in this country today with any degree [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1292.48s)]
*  of certainty that can tell you who is going to win this election and if you care about your country [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1300.32s)]
*  and the future direction of this country my humble advice especially if you live in Georgia, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1307.52s)]
*  North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada is to assume that your vote will [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1312.8s)]
*  determine the outcome of this election. I hope everybody will look at it as that important. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1319.68s)]
*  Now for the second straight day no rallies for Kamala Harris instead she was in the Washington [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1324.56s)]
*  swamp using her vice presidential podium. Oh shocking to smear Donald Trump and how Kamala's [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1329.68s)]
*  self-proclaimed joyful campaign, yeah they have now reverted back to the same tired old tactics [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1337.12s)]
*  that we always see from Democrats in election years and it's almost like a permanent cycle [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1343.36s)]
*  and that is smear slander, besmirchment, lying, oh and have supporters comparing Donald Trump to [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1348.24s)]
*  Hitler and to Stalin and to Mussolini and of course he's racist. Today Harris herself used a [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1355.04s)]
*  years-old uncorroborated bogus accusation from a former disgruntled chief of staff to compare [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1361.68s)]
*  Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Take a look. It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1368.3200000000002s)]
*  that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of six [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1375.04s)]
*  million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1383.04s)]
*  All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is. This is a [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1389.76s)]
*  window into who Donald Trump really is. In May of 2018 that same person was praising Donald Trump [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1396.24s)]
*  on NPR. Unfortunately Kamala gets zero points for creativity. Take a look at your screen. Let's have [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1404.08s)]
*  a little history lesson, a Hannity history lesson. In 2008 Democrats, they compared John McCain to [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1411.2s)]
*  Hitler. Four years later, Democratic strategist David Axelrod, he works at Fake News CNN, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1417.04s)]
*  he compared Mitt Romney to Hitler. Nikki Haley was compared to Hitler's girlfriend Ava Braun [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1422.64s)]
*  and we could go on and on and on. It's a time-honored tradition of Democrats comparing [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1429.76s)]
*  Republicans to Nazis. It is a tradition in the Democratic Party. When you have nothing else to [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1436.24s)]
*  run on, this is what you are left with. In fact, just last week, The Atlantic actually compared [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1442.16s)]
*  Trump to Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini, the unholy trinity of evil dictators, right? But remember, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1449.04s)]
*  Donald Trump was president for four years. He started no new wars. He signed a historic peace [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1456.16s)]
*  deal in the Middle East. He lowered your taxes. He cut regulation. He signed criminal justice reform. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1462.0s)]
*  He secured our border. Not exactly the record of an evil, warmongering lover of Adolf Hitler and a [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1467.84s)]
*  madman. And needless to say, the melodramatic comparisons to Hitler, they are falling flat and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1475.04s)]
*  they're all predictable and it's not going to stop there. It'll buckle up. It'll be an emotional [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1481.28s)]
*  rollercoaster ride. The Democrats, their allies and the state-run media mob, they will be trying [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1487.2s)]
*  every day the tactic of a slander, smear, we just found out after 10 years Donald Trump did this and [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1493.1200000000001s)]
*  that and just, just buckle up because you know it's coming. Kamala Harris cannot run on her [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1499.52s)]
*  terrible record or her far-left radical and extreme beliefs. So smearing Donald Trump and calling him [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1506.56s)]
*  names and frankly those that support him calling them names is pretty much the only two left in [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1514.08s)]
*  their political toolbox. But per usual, Barack Obama is so perplexed, he's bewildered about how [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1519.4399999999998s)]
*  American politics have become so bitter. You know, he did once talk about bitter people that cling to [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1526.8s)]
*  their God, guns, Bibles and religion too. Take a look. As frustrating as politics can be sometimes [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1532.48s)]
*  and I know it can be frustrating. Look, I do not watch cable news. I really don't. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1539.8400000000001s)]
*  There are times where I just, I don't understand how we got so toxic and just [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1546.8000000000002s)]
*  so divided and so bitter and I get why sometimes people just don't want to pay attention to it. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1556.0s)]
*  Really Barack, let's do ourselves a favor. Let's take a little walk down memory lane. Maybe we [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1562.16s)]
*  can refresh your memory. Maybe somebody will show this to you considering you don't watch cable news, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1568.72s)]
*  although you mentioned me about 10 or 15 times when you were running for president. Take a look. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1574.64s)]
*  I'll put, I'll put Mr. Burgess up against Sean Hannity. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1579.52s)]
*  He'll tear him up. If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers before you are president, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1585.04s)]
*  you will accept their support after you're president. You got their plan, which is [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1592.8s)]
*  let's have dirtier air, dirtier water, less people with health insurance. I don't want to quell anger. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1599.6s)]
*  I think people are right to be angry. I'm angry. I need you to go out and talk to your friends and [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1607.6s)]
*  talk to your neighbors. I want you to talk to them, whether they're independent or whether they are [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1613.2s)]
*  Republican. I want you to argue with them and get in their face. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1619.12s)]
*  Argue with them, get in their face. I have no idea how politics has gotten this way. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1625.84s)]
*  Every two, every four years, the same playbook from the Democrats. Well, now the smears are worse than [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1630.96s)]
*  ever. They're in a panic. At this point, they just hate Donald Trump, hate his supporters so much, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1637.36s)]
*  it seems there is nothing that they won't do or they won't say. So buckle up. It's only going to [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1643.6799999999998s)]
*  get worse. Most Americans, they simply want the price of every item they buy in every store they [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1650.0s)]
*  go to to come down. They want to pay less for a gallon of gasoline. They would like a secure border [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1657.12s)]
*  so people from 180 countries and countries would terrorize and known terrorists and murderers and [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1664.32s)]
*  rapists and violent criminals and gangs and cartels don't come into our country. They want less crime. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1671.84s)]
*  They want a world of peace. But the best the Democrat Democratic Party, the best Kamala Harris [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1677.84s)]
*  can do is offer a more anti-Trump hysteria. That is their favorite go-to. That includes former comedian, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1684.08s)]
*  turned emotional Democratic sycophant, Jimmy Kimmel. Take a look. I'm an optimistic person. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1691.52s)]
*  I'm not hysterical. I laugh when people say, oh, you've got Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1698.08s)]
*  If you're a reasonable person, you should have Trump derangement syndrome. And by the way, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1704.24s)]
*  I think he has derangement syndrome about us too. The fact of the matter is this is a dangerous person. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1708.72s)]
*  No matter, no wonder nobody watches the show and Greg Gutfeld keeps kicking his ass. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1716.24s)]
*  Anyway, speaking of Trump derangement syndrome, poor Democratic strategists, our friend James [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1720.96s)]
*  Carville, he's getting more and more unglued every day. Now he's comparing this election [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1725.6s)]
*  to slitting throats in World War II. And I'm not making that up. Take a look. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1730.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm really not interested in being very fair about the whole thing. Okay. I'm there. I really [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1737.04s)]
*  don't think we should have fought fair against the Germans and the Japanese. I think we should have [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1744.1599999999999s)]
*  like snuck around them. And I think we should have, you know, gone behind him in the lines and cut [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1747.9199999999998s)]
*  their throats because that was what was at stake. I think we're literally approaching the same place [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1752.16s)]
*  right now. I'm not talking about everybody stop. Don't think I'm not talking about actually [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1759.0400000000002s)]
*  splitting a political opponent's throat. Don't fight fair, slit their throats, but I don't mean [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1764.96s)]
*  actually, James, you may need to check with your doctor. You may need to increase your daily dose [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1771.3600000000001s)]
*  of those gummies that you were talking about. Now think about this. Democrats, the Biden [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1778.32s)]
*  administration, they have tried to put Trump in jail. They have tried to remove him from the ballot [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1782.6399999999999s)]
*  in multiple states. They have pressured big tech companies to censor conservatives online. They held [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1787.76s)]
*  a bogus primary that Biden won by millions of votes before the party elites decided to remove him from [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1794.3999999999999s)]
*  the top of the ticket and simply installed Kamala Harris in a last minute political coup. Kamala [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1801.2s)]
*  herself has frequently called for the Senate filibuster to be eliminated so she can ram through [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1807.52s)]
*  her radical agenda like the radical Green New Deal with ease. Kamala is also apparently open to [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  packing the US Supreme Court, which would all but eliminate a co-equal branch of our government [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1819.6s)]
*  and corrupt our system of checks and balances. Both Kamala Harris and Tim Walz routinely attacked [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1826.0s)]
*  the first amendment and they want to unilaterally destroy the second amendment. Maybe somebody could [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1831.92s)]
*  teach Tim how to load his own shotgun. Anyway, Democrats want Americans, they want you to believe [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1837.12s)]
*  that Trump is a threat to democracy. Buckle up. The next 13 days, the smear, the slander, the lying, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1843.52s)]
*  the besmirchment, the attacks will get worse hour after hour after hour. Here's only one question [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1852.8s)]
*  that really matters. Are you better off than you were four years ago? That very question is a big [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1859.84s)]
*  problem for Kamala Harris and today our very own Sarah Carter caught up with several Harris supporters [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1866.88s)]
*  in Philadelphia who are now worried that Kamala might not have what it takes to win this election. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1872.72s)]
*  Take a look. To Vice President Kamala Harris is going to be here tonight. I know. So you're probably [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1878.24s)]
*  going to be watching, right? Yeah. What do you want to hear from her? Do you want, is there something [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1883.3600000000001s)]
*  that you haven't heard yet that you'd like to hear? Do you want her details? Well, I want, I know what her position is on the [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1887.92s)]
*  border and I know what her position is on inflation, but I also think that sometimes she tends [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1893.36s)]
*  not to get to the point. So I would really like her to explain it more pointedly. How are you feeling [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1898.8s)]
*  about the election today? I mean, very worried. Very worried. Very worried. What has you worried? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1905.12s)]
*  Yeah, very, very worried. Very close and I can't understand how it could be close. Mind if I ask [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1912.24s)]
*  you who you voted for? I voted for Kamala. Do you feel the eyes on you? Oh yeah, it's very tense. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1919.36s)]
*  Especially as a walking tour guide talking about history. Oh, well yeah, this is it. I mean, this [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1928.0s)]
*  is Independence Hall. This is our constitution, our founding fathers. How important is this election [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1933.04s)]
*  to you as a young voter? I think it's pivotal. How important is this election to you [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1939.4399999999998s)]
*  in modern political history right now? Yeah, I guess it is pretty important. It does affect [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1945.84s)]
*  all of our lives obviously and we do need to make a good decision regarding who we choose. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1953.4399999999998s)]
*  That works. I'm gonna use that later tonight. Happy Wednesday everyone. So to encourage couples to [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1961.4399999999998s)]
*  have more children, South Korea is offering a program that will provide nannies for only [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1968.6399999999999s)]
*  $27 an hour. In a related story, guess who's moving to South Korea? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1973.76s)]
*  Yeah, at a campaign event in Detroit, Eminem introduced Barack Obama, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1983.04s)]
*  which makes sense. They both made a career out of pretending to be black. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1992.4s)]
*  What'd he say? If he would have said that two weeks ago, I'd have been mad. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2003.92s)]
*  Self-proclaimed witches have been trying to cast curses on Donald Trump. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2011.12s)]
*  Sadly for them though, they were beaten to the punch. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2015.84s)]
*  A new poll shows Trump with a slim lead over Harris with Arab Americans. Harris would attempt [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2025.92s)]
*  to speak directly to those voters, but she hasn't yet nailed the accent. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2031.52s)]
*  Missouri TV reporter was hurt by a bullet fragment at a Democrat Senate candidate's gun demonstration. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2041.44s)]
*  Nearly shooting a reporter. He must be trying to appeal to Republicans. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2048.56s)]
*  But as one Democrat noted, hey, these things happen. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2053.84s)]
*  A drunk driver in Milwaukee nearly crashed into Kamala's motorcade. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2061.7599999999998s)]
*  No one was injured and the boozed up driver claimed he was heading to Iraq. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2067.36s)]
*  Passengers on a Spirit Airlines flight from Dallas to LA [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2081.44s)]
*  freaked out when they saw a rat roaming around the plane. How embarrassing for the rat. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2085.12s)]
*  The NFL Players Association claims that having reporters in the locker rooms is an invasion of [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2094.96s)]
*  privacy, especially if it's a late night talk show host pretending to be a reporter. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2099.44s)]
*  And finally, the insane clown posse has endorsed Kamala Harris for president. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2104.08s)]
*  Here they are without their makeup. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2114.56s)]
*  All right, not a long time. So back in 2007, in written testimony to Congress, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2117.12s)]
*  D.A. Kamala Harris showed herself capable of some truly inspired argumentation. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2122.24s)]
*  There was only one problem. That inspiring language wasn't hers. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2127.92s)]
*  She was a woman. She was a woman. She was a woman. She was a woman. She was a woman. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2132.56s)]
*  She was a woman. She was a woman. She was a woman. She was a woman. She was a woman. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2137.6s)]
*  There was only one problem. That inspiring language wasn't hers. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2141.8399999999997s)]
*  See, when she wasn't just lifting a wine glass, she was lifting all those sentences. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2146.88s)]
*  According to the Washington Free Beacon, Kamala's statement in support of a loan repayment plan for [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2151.92s)]
*  local prosecutors was taken almost verbatim from an Illinois D.A.'s opinion on the same subject [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2156.88s)]
*  that was given to the Senate months prior. Roughly 80 percent of her testimony was copied word for [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2163.2799999999997s)]
*  from that old guy over there, Carl Loggley of Winnebago County, Illinois, who by the way, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2169.76s)]
*  is a Republican. Holy ****. That's like me stealing jokes from Jimmy Kimmel. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2176.32s)]
*  I never do that, not because he's my competition, but because he has cancer of the funny bone. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2184.1600000000003s)]
*  But that's not the only time she committed stolen verbiage. While she was California A.G., [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2190.2400000000002s)]
*  she published the report on sex trafficking in her state. In that, she copied a fictional, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2195.44s)]
*  fictional example of the type of call received by the National Human Trafficking Hotline, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2201.2000000000003s)]
*  which told the story of how a woman in D.C. was saved from forced prostitution. But in her report, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2206.7200000000003s)]
*  Harris never said the story was fake. Instead, she changed the location to San Fran to get credit [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2214.2400000000002s)]
*  for a rescue that never actually happened. Dirty. There are other examples, but this is at least [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2221.44s)]
*  the second time Harris has been caught in a blatant act of plagiarism. She's the literary [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2227.6s)]
*  version of a smash and grabber. Remember, Kamala, anything under 900 words and you won't get charged. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2232.56s)]
*  The language, and the language is exactly the same line after line. Harris even kept the typos [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2241.76s)]
*  and grammar errors. She didn't even try to make her theft look like her own. I mean, maybe it's [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2249.28s)]
*  because she loves rap and she considers it more like sampling. But it's weird, you know, that none [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2255.2000000000003s)]
*  of this is surprising. Perhaps because her only concrete policy proposal, no taxes on tips, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2260.5600000000004s)]
*  she stole from another Republican, her opponent. So in light of the fact that nothing Kamala says [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2266.96s)]
*  gives you any idea of what she believes. Is it any surprise that less than two weeks out from [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2274.24s)]
*  election day, even Rachel Levine is asking, who the hell is this woman? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2279.52s)]
*  Now, all this comes on the heels of a report that Kamala lifted entire sections of her policy book, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2286.9599999999996s)]
*  Smart on Crime. Who knew she was actually talking about herself stealing? Even the New York Times, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2292.9599999999996s)]
*  which initially rushed to defend her, finally had to admit her thievery. But the real point isn't [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2298.56s)]
*  Kamala's serial plagiarism. It's how in the past this would end a campaign. It would lead every newscast. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2303.92s)]
*  This would be the October surprise. I mean, this is way worse than what sunk Joe Biden in 87, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2311.2000000000003s)]
*  when he was caught stealing speeches from a British leader. And worse, it was this guy he stole it from. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2317.2000000000003s)]
*  That's pretty damn good. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2328.64s)]
*  But also, Harris has no core principles, or any non-core principles. Her head is as empty as her [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2329.68s)]
*  husband's balls after nanny season. There is a nanny season. There is a nanny season? Yes. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2339.8399999999997s)]
*  She grew up in a middle-class family. That was pretty well off. She's an American that spent her [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2350.96s)]
*  formative years in Canada, and she's going to save democracy after she plotted a coup against her boss. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2356.96s)]
*  I don't even know what Doug sees in her, since she won't put him down for a nap. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2362.56s)]
*  In fact, she might be the least honest politician ever. Listen to her on the Biden decline coverup. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2368.8s)]
*  Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those moments with [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2374.7200000000003s)]
*  President Biden as you were with him again and again, repeatedly in that time? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2378.7200000000003s)]
*  Of course. Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced, and capable. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2383.04s)]
*  You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2395.6000000000004s)]
*  It was a bad debate. Can the American people trust you in these moments, even when it's maybe [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2399.76s)]
*  uncomfortable for Americans to have, to level with Americans in that way? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2403.76s)]
*  I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real firsthand account of watching him do this work. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2408.32s)]
*  I have no reluctance in saying that. Apologies. That should have come with bongos. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2419.04s)]
*  Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced, and [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2425.6000000000004s)]
*  capable. In every way, I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real firsthand account [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2435.12s)]
*  of watching him do this work. It always makes more sense. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2447.52s)]
*  Incredible. But like the conveyor belt at the manure factory, the load of crap keeps coming. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2456.7999999999997s)]
*  Listen to her on transgender laws. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2463.12s)]
*  Do you believe that transgender Americans should have access to gender-affirming care in this country? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2465.92s)]
*  I believe we should follow the law. I mean, I think you're probably pointing to the fact that [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2471.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars. They're trying to define you on this. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2475.44s)]
*  I'm asking you to define yourself, though. Just broadly speaking, what is your value? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2480.64s)]
*  Do you believe they should have that access? I believe that people, as the law states, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2484.4s)]
*  even on this issue about federal law. What horse s***? The reporter even set up the question [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2489.6s)]
*  as a pro-trans layup, and she still threw a brick as if she actually has no impact on the law. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2497.2799999999997s)]
*  And remember, there are other laws she doesn't follow, like the 25th Amendment. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2503.52s)]
*  You know, you thought Biden was an empty vessel. He's got nothing on this broad. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2508.88s)]
*  Fact is, we really don't know what this woman stands for. Maybe that's the point. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2512.48s)]
