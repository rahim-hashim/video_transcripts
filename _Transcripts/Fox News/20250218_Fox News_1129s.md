# Trump, Musk pull curtain back behind relationship, media's divide and conquer mission
**Fox News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo)
*  I've got to start with this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=0.0s)]
*  So he's working for free with Doge. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=2.2s)]
*  He's kind of put a lot of his life on hold. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=5.68s)]
*  And you sued Twitter a number of years ago. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=9.32s)]
*  You just made him pay you $10 million? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=12.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=14.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  I sued from long before he had it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=16.96s)]
*  And I mean, they really did a number on me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=19.88s)]
*  You know? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=22.96s)]
*  I sued, and they had to pay. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=23.88s)]
*  They paid $10 million settlement. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=25.44s)]
*  You're OK with that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I left it up to the lawyers and the team running Twitter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=29.72s)]
*  So I said, you guys do what you think is the right—it makes sense. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  I think it's funny. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=36.92s)]
*  I think it's a very low—I was looking to get much more money than that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=37.72s)]
*  So you gave him a discount on the lawsuit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=41.56s)]
*  He got a discount. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=43.0s)]
*  Oh, he got a big discount. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=43.56s)]
*  I don't think he even knows about it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=45.72s)]
*  He's become one of your—if you read and believe the media, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=47.36s)]
*  he's become one of your best friends. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=50.56s)]
*  He's working for free for you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=51.92s)]
*  Well, I love the president. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  I just want to be clear about that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=54.24s)]
*  I don't care about that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=56.4s)]
*  I know. I love the president. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=57.32s)]
*  You love the president. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  I think President Trump is a good man, and he's, you know— [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=59.48s)]
*  That's nice the way he said that, you know? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=64.32s)]
*  There's something nice about him. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=66.24s)]
*  It really is. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=67.28s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=67.88s)]
*  You know, because, I mean, the president has been so unfairly attacked in the media. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=68.36s)]
*  It's really outrageous. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=75.0s)]
*  And I've spent—at this point, spent a lot of time with the president. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=77.24s)]
*  And not once have I seen him do something that was mean or cruel or wrong. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=81.28s)]
*  Not once. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=88.4s)]
*  I've known him for 30 years. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=91.08s)]
*  And I've never seen anybody take as much as he's taken. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=95.8s)]
*  And we've discussed this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, how do you deal with it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  Did he have a choice? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=99.36s)]
*  Well, you would say that to me. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=100.8s)]
*  I'm like, what am I going to do? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  Worry about it? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=103.88s)]
*  And then culminating in two assassination attempts, which resulted in your endorsement. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=104.52s)]
*  Well, I was going to do it anyway, but that was a— [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=109.96s)]
*  That was it? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  —perceptive event, yes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=112.35999999999999s)]
*  That speeded it up a little bit. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=113.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  The day of the assassination. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=115.28s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=116.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  I just spent it up, but I was going to do it anyway. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, with your indulgence, I'm convinced that people only know a little bit about Elon. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  I don't think they know everything about Elon, because as I studied for—and prepared for [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=128.68s)]
*  this interview, I learned a lot about you that I didn't know. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=133.08s)]
*  I think people will think about Tesla, Democrats are demonizing you and trying to make the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=136.84s)]
*  country hate you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=142.12s)]
*  I just want people to understand you a little bit better. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=143.88s)]
*  And the person that you've gotten to know and have now put a lot of trust in. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, just let's go over a little bit of your bios, starting with PayPal and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  how you became involved in Tesla and SpaceX and Neuralink and all these— [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=156.64s)]
*  Listen, take a while. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=162.2s)]
*  I mean, you know, I think the way you think of me is like I'm a technologist, and I [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=163.2s)]
*  try to make technologies that improve the world and make life better. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  You can show your shirt. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and that's why I like my T-shirt says Tech Support, because I'm here to provide [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  the president with technology support. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=176.36s)]
*  And now that may seem like, well, is that a silly thing? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  But actually, it's a very important thing, because the president will make these executive [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  orders, which are very sensible and good for the country, but then they don't get implemented, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  you know? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=192.08s)]
*  So if you take, for example, all the funding for the migrant hotels, the president issued [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=193.08s)]
*  executive order, hey, we need to stop taking taxpayer money and paying for luxury hotels [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=198.44000000000003s)]
*  for illegal immigrants. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=203.84s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=204.84s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=206.32s)]
*  Like, obviously, people do not want their tax dollars going to fund high-end hotels [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=207.32s)]
*  for illegals. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  And yet they were still doing that, even as late as last week. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, we went in there and we're like, this is a violation of the presidential [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=217.44s)]
*  executive order. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=221.9s)]
*  It needs to stop. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=222.9s)]
*  So what we're doing here is—one of the biggest functions of the Doge team is just [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  making sure that the presidential executive orders are actually carried out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  And this is—I just want to point out, this is a very important thing, because the president [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=235.32000000000002s)]
*  is the elected representative of the people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=239.8s)]
*  So it's representing the will of the people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  And if the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people and preventing the president [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=245.52s)]
*  from implementing what the people want, then what we live in is a bureaucracy and not a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=250.84s)]
*  democracy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=255.8s)]
*  You're both aware, you have to be keenly aware, that the media and the punditry class, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  not that—you know, I think you've proven they have no power anymore, because they threw [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=266.16s)]
*  everything they had at you, and they didn't win. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=270.48s)]
*  And that was, you know, The New York Times, Washington Post, three networks, every late-night [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=273.04s)]
*  comedy show, two cable channels. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=278.32s)]
*  They just threw everything, lawfare, weaponization. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=280.64s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  And now I see they want you two to start—they want a divorce. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=286.56s)]
*  They want you two to start hating each other, and they try—oh, President Elon Musk, for [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  example. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=295.24s)]
*  You do know that they're doing that to you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=296.24s)]
*  Oh, I see it all the time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=298.08s)]
*  They tried it, then they stopped. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  That wasn't—they have many different things of hatred. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=301.48s)]
*  Actually, Elon called me. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=304.8s)]
*  He said, you know, they're trying to drive us apart. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=307.16s)]
*  I said, absolutely. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=309.2s)]
*  No, they said, we have breaking news. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=310.44s)]
*  Donald Trump has ceded control of the presidency to Elon Musk. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=312.64s)]
*  President Musk will be attending a Cabinet meeting tonight at 8 o'clock. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=317.84s)]
*  And I say, it's just so obvious. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=322.08s)]
*  They're so bad at it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  I used to think they were good at it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=325.28s)]
*  They're actually bad at it, because if they were good at it, I'd never be president, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=326.88s)]
*  because I think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=331.08s)]
*  I could do the greatest things. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=335.52s)]
*  I get 98 percent bad publicity. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=337.68s)]
*  I could do—outside of you and a few of your very good friends. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=339.8s)]
*  It's like the craziest thing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=343.8s)]
*  But you know what I have learned, Elon? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=345.56s)]
*  The people are smart. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=347.0s)]
*  They get it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=348.0s)]
*  Yeah, they do, actually. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=349.0s)]
*  They get it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=350.0s)]
*  They really see what's happening. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=351.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=352.48s)]
*  And at the end of this interview, what I would like is, I want people to know the relationship [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=353.48s)]
*  and know more about you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=361.0s)]
*  What is the relationship, Mr. President? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=363.08s)]
*  Well, I respect him. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=364.76s)]
*  I've always respected him. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=365.88s)]
*  I never knew that he was right on certain things, and I'm usually pretty good at this [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=368.44s)]
*  stuff. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=373.56s)]
*  He did Starlink. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=374.84s)]
*  He did things that were so advanced, and nobody knew what the hell they were. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=377.5s)]
*  I can tell you, in North Carolina, they had no communication. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=381.28s)]
*  They were wiped out. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  Those people were—you know, they had rivers in between. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  Land that never saw water, all of a sudden there was a river and a vicious—like rapids. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=388.44s)]
*  People were dying all over. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  They had no communication. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=394.67999999999995s)]
*  They said, do you know Elon Musk? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=395.8s)]
*  They didn't really know I knew him. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=397.8s)]
*  I said, yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=399.8s)]
*  He said, could you get Starlink? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=400.8s)]
*  It's like the first time I ever heard of it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=402.44s)]
*  I said, what Starlink? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=403.76s)]
*  A communication system that's unbelievable. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=404.76s)]
*  I have it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=407.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=408.76s)]
*  And he said—I called him, and I said, listen, they really need it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=409.76s)]
*  And he got, like, thousands of units of this communication, and it saved a lot of lives. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=412.76s)]
*  He got it immediately, and you can't get it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=420.16s)]
*  I mean, you have to wait a long time to get it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=421.96000000000004s)]
*  But he got it to him immediately, and I said, that's pretty amazing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=424.48s)]
*  And I didn't even know he had it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=427.4s)]
*  We watched the rocket ships, and we watched Tesla. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=429.36s)]
*  I think, you know, something that had an effect on me was when I saw the rocket ship come [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=432.2s)]
*  back and get grabbed, like you grab a beautiful little baby. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=435.88s)]
*  You grab your baby. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=439.8s)]
*  It just— [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=441.52s)]
*  You hug the rocket. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=442.52s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=443.52s)]
*  You hug the rocket. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=444.52s)]
*  You hug the rocket. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=445.52s)]
*  You hug the rocket. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=446.52s)]
*  You hug the rocket. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=447.52s)]
*  You hug the rocket. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=448.52s)]
*  You hug the rocket. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=449.52s)]
*  You hug the rocket. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=450.52s)]
*  You hug the rocket. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=451.52s)]
*  You hug the rocket. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=452.52s)]
*  And he saved it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  First time that I've ever seen that done. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  And nobody else can do it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=457.47999999999996s)]
*  If you look at the U.S., Russia, or China, they can't do it, and they won't be able [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  to do it for a long time. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=463.44s)]
*  He has the technology. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=464.68s)]
*  So you learn—I wanted somebody really smart to work with me in terms of the country, a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=465.76s)]
*  very important aspect, because—I mean, he doesn't talk about it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=474.0s)]
*  He's actually a very good businessman. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=476.91999999999996s)]
*  And when he talks about the executive orders—and this is probably true for all precedents— [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=478.97999999999996s)]
*  you write an executive order and you think it's done. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=484.2s)]
*  You send it out. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't get done. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't get implemented. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  They don't implement it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  Maybe they're from the last administration, and they are in some cases. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=490.8s)]
*  You try and get them out as fast as you can. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  But I could—as soon as he said that, I said, you know, that's interesting. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=497.0s)]
*  You write a beautiful executive and you sign it and you assume it's going to be done, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=501.24s)]
*  but it's not. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=505.72s)]
*  What he does is he takes it, and with his hundred geniuses—he's got some very brilliant [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=506.72s)]
*  young people working for him that dress much worse than him, actually. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=510.92s)]
*  They dress in just T-shirts. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=515.08s)]
*  You wouldn't know they have 180. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=517.0s)]
*  He's your tech support. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=520.0s)]
*  I actually am tech support. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=521.0s)]
*  I literally am tech support, though. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=522.0s)]
*  But he gets it done. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=523.0s)]
*  He's a leader. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=524.0s)]
*  He really is a—he gets it done. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=525.0s)]
*  You get a lot of tech people, and you have people that are good with tech, but they get—he [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=526.0s)]
*  gets it done. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=531.76s)]
*  You know, I said in real estate, you had guys that would draw beautiful renderings of a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=532.76s)]
*  building, and they'd draw the rendering, and it would be great. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=535.72s)]
*  And you'd say, great, when are you starting? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=537.84s)]
*  They would never be able to get it built. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=540.26s)]
*  They couldn't get the financing. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=541.5799999999999s)]
*  They couldn't get the approvals. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=542.5799999999999s)]
*  It would never get done. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=543.5799999999999s)]
*  And then you have other guys that are able to get it done. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=545.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, they could just get it done. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  That was in real estate. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=549.9399999999999s)]
*  Same thing in this. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=551.3s)]
*  He gets it done. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=552.4599999999999s)]
*  So when he said that, he said, you know, when you sign these executive orders, a lot of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=553.4599999999999s)]
*  them don't get done and may be the most important ones. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=556.9399999999999s)]
*  And he would take that executive order that I'd signed, and he would have those people [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=560.14s)]
*  go to whatever agency it was. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=564.16s)]
*  When are you doing it? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=566.8599999999999s)]
*  Get it done. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=568.12s)]
*  Get it done. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=569.12s)]
*  And then you have a guy that maybe didn't want to do it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden, he's signing. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=572.0600000000001s)]
*  He just doesn't want to be bothered. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=573.8s)]
*  Do a lot of those executive orders have to be codified into law? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=575.92s)]
*  You need the Republican Congress to follow up. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=579.36s)]
*  Yeah, and they will be. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=581.36s)]
*  A lot of them will be. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=582.36s)]
*  They will. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=583.36s)]
*  Look, in the meantime, we have four years. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=584.36s)]
*  The beauty is we have four years. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=585.36s)]
*  That's why I like doing it right at the beginning, because an executive order is great. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=586.36s)]
*  I mean, the one problem is both good and bad, because when they did all these executive [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=590.16s)]
*  orders, they've canceled most of them. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=594.72s)]
*  They were terrible. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're going to go radical left communists. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=597.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay, it was crazy. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  Their executive orders were so bad. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=600.8s)]
*  If they ever got them codified, you'd never be able to break them. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  So the damage that Biden has done to this country, and it's not even Biden, it's the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=607.0s)]
*  people that circled him in the Oval Office. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=611.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=613.8399999999999s)]
*  But the damage they did to this country in terms of, let's say, open borders, you know, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=614.8399999999999s)]
*  there's so many things, but open borders where millions of people poured into our country [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  and hundreds of thousands of those people are criminals. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=624.06s)]
*  They're murderers. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=629.0s)]
*  They're drug dealers. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=630.0s)]
*  They're gang members. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=631.0s)]
*  They're people from prisons from all over the world. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=632.0s)]
*  And we have a great guy, Tom Homan, and he is doing so incredibly. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=634.52s)]
*  You saw the numbers. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=639.28s)]
*  They're now 96%. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=640.28s)]
*  95%. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=641.28s)]
*  He is a phenomenal guy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=642.28s)]
*  And Kristi Noem is doing an unbelievable job. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=645.08s)]
*  And he wanted her. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=647.92s)]
*  He said, she's so tough. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=649.12s)]
*  And I said, I don't think of her as that way. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=650.12s)]
*  You know, she's very nice. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=652.84s)]
*  He said, no, she's so tough. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=653.84s)]
*  And she is. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=655.52s)]
*  I see with the horses. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=656.52s)]
*  She's riding the horse. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=657.52s)]
*  She's great. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=659.4s)]
*  But the team we have is really unbelievable. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=660.4s)]
*  But those executive orders, I sign them, and now they get passed on to him and his group [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=662.84s)]
*  and other people, and they're all getting done. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=668.48s)]
*  We're getting them done. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  Let me go back a little bit to your background, because it's beyond impressive. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=673.4s)]
*  You were the chief engineer, for example. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=677.84s)]
*  You were an early believer in Tesla. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=680.12s)]
*  You became the CEO and then the chief engineer, which was phenomenal. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=682.28s)]
*  SpaceX, same thing, which is unbelievable. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=689.12s)]
*  I mean, you were the first company, private company, to send astronauts successfully into [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=692.12s)]
*  space, first private company, to send astronauts into orbit. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=698.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=703.2s)]
*  That's pretty deep. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=704.2s)]
*  He's going to go into orbit soon. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=705.2s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=706.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=707.2s)]
*  No, he's going to go to Mars. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=708.2s)]
*  He's going to fly on his... [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=709.2s)]
*  Starlink? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=710.2s)]
*  At some point. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=711.2s)]
*  Huh? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=712.2s)]
*  Is in orbit. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=713.2s)]
*  They always ask me, like, do you want to die on Mars? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=714.2s)]
*  And I say, well, yes, but not on impact. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=715.2s)]
*  Starlink is in 100 countries. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=716.2s)]
*  This is going to be hard. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=718.08s)]
*  I feel like I'm interviewing two brothers here. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=719.08s)]
*  You go ahead. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=722.08s)]
*  Star Shield, which could be used for national defense. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it is already being used for national defense. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=725.84s)]
*  Then you have a... [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=728.4000000000001s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=730.9200000000001s)]
*  Optimus, a part of Tesla. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  The robot, yeah. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=732.9200000000001s)]
*  A robotic arm. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=733.9200000000001s)]
*  Then you have an AI arm. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=735.5600000000001s)]
*  And then you have something that really fascinated me, and it's called Neuralink. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=737.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=742.96s)]
*  You might help the blind to see, and people with spinal cord injuries, that they can recover [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=744.72s)]
*  where in the past... [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=751.52s)]
*  How close is that becoming a success? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=753.52s)]
*  Neuralink, we've implanted Neuralink in three patients so far who are quadriplegics, and [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=755.96s)]
*  it allows them to directly control their phone and computer just using their mind, just by [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=762.24s)]
*  thinking. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=766.4000000000001s)]
*  It's like... [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=767.4000000000001s)]
*  So we call this product telepathy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=768.4000000000001s)]
*  So you control your computer and phone just by thinking, and it's possible to actually [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=769.4000000000001s)]
*  control the computer and phone faster than someone who has working hands. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=773.6s)]
*  The next step would be to add a second Neuralink implant past the point where the neurons are [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=778.1999999999999s)]
*  damaged so that somebody can walk again, so they can have full body functionality restored. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  And... [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=791.3199999999999s)]
*  And you like Bobby, right? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  I like Bobby, actually, yeah. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  I supported Bobby Kennedy. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=796.36s)]
*  I think he's unfairly aligned as someone who is anti-science, but I think he isn't. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=799.52s)]
*  He just wants to question the science, which is the essence of the science. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=805.76s)]
*  The scientific method fundamentally is about always questioning the science. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, they didn't tell us the truth about COVID, that's for sure. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=812.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=815.52s)]
*  And we learned a lot with the Twitter files. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=816.52s)]
*  And that just then raises a question. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=819.12s)]
*  You're the richest man in the world. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=820.72s)]
*  You may not like that part. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=823.0s)]
*  I mean, it's... [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=824.0s)]
*  You're pretty competitive. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=825.0s)]
*  I've known you a long time. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=826.0s)]
*  I mean, it's... [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=827.0s)]
*  I mean, it's... [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=828.0s)]
*  Well, that's true. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=829.6s)]
*  We can't top that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=830.6s)]
*  He's good. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=831.6s)]
*  You know, I wanted to find somebody smarter than him. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=832.6s)]
*  I searched all over. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=835.8s)]
*  I just couldn't do it. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=837.56s)]
*  I couldn't. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=838.56s)]
*  You really tried hard, didn't you? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=839.56s)]
*  I couldn't find anyone smarter, right? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=840.96s)]
*  So we had to... [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=842.84s)]
*  We had to... [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=843.84s)]
*  For the country. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=844.84s)]
*  But this is the thing... [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=845.84s)]
*  We settled on this guy. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=846.84s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=847.84s)]
*  I'm just trying to be useful here. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=848.84s)]
*  But this is the interesting... [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=849.84s)]
*  This is where we are as a society. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=850.84s)]
*  And I hate to do this to you, but I'm going to do it anyway. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=854.84s)]
*  You're doing all of these things. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=859.8399999999999s)]
*  You're Doge. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=860.8399999999999s)]
*  Nobody at Doge gets paid a penny, correct? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=861.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, actually, some people are federal employees. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=863.8399999999999s)]
*  Some are? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=866.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=867.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=868.04s)]
*  They're helping. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=869.04s)]
*  But it's fair to say that the software engineers at Doge could be earning millions of dollars [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=870.04s)]
*  a year instead of earning a small fraction of that as federal employees. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=873.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=876.8399999999999s)]
*  So... [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=877.8399999999999s)]
*  And they're very committed people. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=878.8399999999999s)]
*  So you're committed to helping the blind see people with spinal cord injuries recover. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=880.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=886.56s)]
*  You're committed to getting to Mars. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=888.1999999999999s)]
*  You're committed to rescue... [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  You're going to help rescue next month two astronauts that I think were abandoned. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  They dispute that in an interview. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=895.92s)]
*  When are you going to... [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=897.9599999999999s)]
*  At the president's request, or instruction, we are accelerating the return of the astronauts, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  which was postponed kind of to a ridiculous degree. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=904.52s)]
*  They got left in space. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  They've been there... [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=909.0s)]
*  They were supposed to be there eight days. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=910.0s)]
*  They're there almost 300. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=911.4799999999999s)]
*  Biden. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=912.4799999999999s)]
*  They were put... [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=913.4799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=914.4799999999999s)]
*  They were left up there for political reasons, which is not good. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=915.4799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=918.4s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=919.4s)]
*  Now, if I had the weight of the pressure of doing that successfully on my shoulders, I [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=920.4s)]
*  think I'd be... [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=925.16s)]
*  You know, but you... [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=926.16s)]
*  We spoke before we did this interview. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=929.28s)]
*  You are very confident. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=931.28s)]
*  You think this will be a successful mission. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=932.44s)]
*  Well, we don't want to be complacent, but we have brought astronauts back from the space [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=934.36s)]
*  station many times before and always with success. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=938.36s)]
*  So as long as we're not complacent... [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=941.32s)]
*  When are they... [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=944.4s)]
*  When are you going to launch? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=945.4s)]
*  I think it's about four weeks to bring them back. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=946.4s)]
*  About four weeks? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=950.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=951.16s)]
*  And you have the go ahead. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=952.16s)]
*  We're being extremely cautious. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=953.16s)]
*  You now have the go ahead. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=954.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=955.16s)]
*  Well, thanks to you... [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=956.16s)]
*  They didn't have the go ahead with Biden. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=957.16s)]
*  He was going to leave them in space. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=958.16s)]
*  I think he was going to leave them in space. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=960.4s)]

*  Yeah, he didn't want the publicity. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=964.56s)]
*  Can you believe it? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=966.36s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=967.36s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=969.36s)]

*  So people get hit with Hurricane Helene, they have no communication with the outside world. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=976.04s)]
*  You come to the rescue, you donated that, I believe? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=981.22s)]
*  You donated to the people... [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=984.52s)]
*  He saved a lot of lives in North Carolina. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=985.52s)]
*  He saved a lot of lives. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=988.32s)]
*  And California after the wildfires. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=989.78s)]
*  California, but I mean in North Carolina where they were really in trouble, they had no communication. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=991.28s)]
*  People were dying. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=995.8000000000001s)]
*  They were dying of starvation. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=996.8000000000001s)]
*  He saved a lot of lives in North Carolina. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=998.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1000.96s)]

*  And now, again, you do all of this... [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1004.4s)]
*  I would think liberals would love the fact that you have the biggest electric vehicle [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1010.28s)]
*  company in the world. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1014.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1015.76s)]
*  I mean, I used to be adored by the left. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1016.76s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1017.76s)]
*  Less so these days. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1018.76s)]
*  He killed that, huh? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1019.76s)]
*  I mean, less so... [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1020.76s)]
*  I really didn't remember. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1021.76s)]
*  I mean, this whole sort of like, you know... [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1023.76s)]
*  They call it like Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1026.76s)]
*  And you don't realize how real this is until, like, it's... [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1029.12s)]
*  You can't reason with people. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1032.8799999999999s)]
*  So, like, I was at a friend's birthday party in LA, just a birthday dinner, and it was [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  like a nice quiet dinner and everyone was behaving normally. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1038.6s)]
*  And I happened to mention... [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1041.92s)]
*  This was before the election, like a month or two before. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1042.92s)]
*  I happened to mention the president's name. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1044.72s)]
*  And it was like they got shot with a dart in the jugular that contained like methamphetamine [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1046.72s)]
*  and rabies. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1051.0s)]
*  And it was like, wah! [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1052.24s)]
*  And I'm like, what is wrong with... [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1053.24s)]
*  Guys, like, you can't have, like, a normal conversation. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1055.56s)]
*  And it's like they become completely irrational. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1058.84s)]
*  He has no idea. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1062.16s)]
*  If you're friends with him, you pay a price. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1063.92s)]
*  You know? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1066.12s)]
*  It's like walking in a restaurant in New York and it's like half the room gets daggers and [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1067.12s)]
*  they want to... [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1071.04s)]
*  No, the eye daggers level is insane. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1072.04s)]
*  I mean, there was like... [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1077.4s)]
*  I had like some invitation, because... [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1078.4s)]
*  So I got invited to, like, basically a big sort of dem event, like, that was... [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1081.24s)]
*  But I received the invitation, like, the beginning of last year, and then... [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1088.04s)]
*  And I still attended even after I had endorsed President Trump. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1091.44s)]
*  And I didn't realize how profoundly that would affect, you know, how I was received. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1095.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I walk into the room and I'm getting just the dirty looks from everyone. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1102.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, if looks could kill, I would have been dead several times over. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1108.92s)]
*  But that was not... [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1112.3200000000002s)]
*  Before Trump, BT. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1113.3200000000002s)]
*  Or people would be like, thugs with ashes on the floor. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1114.3200000000002s)]
*  Before Trump, that never happened, right? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1116.3200000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMbcMO5JgEo&t=1118.3200000000002s)]
