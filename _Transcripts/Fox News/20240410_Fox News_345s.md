# Mike Huckabee: Israel's existence is being threatened
**Fox News:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg)
*  Here with reaction Fox News contributor Joe Concha and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor you've lived this, Joe you've covered this. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Governor I don't think it's ever been this bad and I did predict a long time ago back [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  in 07 and 08 that journalism is dead. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=14.5s)]
*  I had no idea at the time how right I really was. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=17.92s)]
*  Yeah the truth is Sean Elvis Presley is more alive than journalism is today and that's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=22.82s)]
*  just an absolute fact. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=28.38s)]
*  It's long been gone and I thought that this article you alluded to it earlier from the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=31.82s)]
*  NPR veteran of 25 years was stunning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=36.06s)]
*  Not in its revelation of something we didn't know but in his admission of it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=40.34s)]
*  I mean just coming out and saying what all of us have felt now for years and I think [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=44.82s)]
*  the obvious question to that is why in the heck do taxpayers invest a dime in something [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=49.06s)]
*  that absolutely hates half the country and half of the people who are helping to pay [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=56.1s)]
*  for it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=60.06s)]
*  Maybe it's time to just say with the deficits we have and the incredible debt we have there [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=61.580000000000005s)]
*  are some things we need to get rid of we could start there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=67.02000000000001s)]
*  Do you see any network news network ABC CBS NBC Joe Concha MSDNC fake news CNN New York [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  Times Washington Post. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=78.74s)]
*  I mean they they are all aligned politically by the end of this election cycle combined. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=82.94s)]
*  This will be the biggest campaign contribution in the history of presidential elections. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=95.69999999999999s)]
*  I mean you can't ask for more fawning coverage than what they give Joe Biden and more anti [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  Trump coverage. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=102.1s)]
*  They're obsessed with him every second every minute of every day. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=103.38s)]
*  John you want to know how broken utterly broken our media is to your point on MSNBC tonight. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=108.26s)]
*  Their special guest that they promoted the hell out of by the way on social media was [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=114.38s)]
*  Michael friggin Avanati phoning in from federal prison to comment on Donald Trump's trials [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=118.82s)]
*  to give his analysis on the whole deal. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=126.3s)]
*  You cannot make this stuff up and look here's the most telling part of that NPR story and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=128.9s)]
*  perhaps why I've seen unless I missed it nothing on the other so-called news networks [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=134.46s)]
*  regarding this piece. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=138.86s)]
*  Yuri Berliner who won't be invited to CPAC anytime soon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  He is a liberal wrote quote the laptop was worthy Hunter Biden's laptop but the timeless [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=142.66s)]
*  journalistic instinct of following a hot story lead was being squelched unquote. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=147.9s)]
*  So it appears that Trump's election seven and a half years ago probably prompted the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=152.82s)]
*  biggest chain reaction in the history of this industry. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  Many journalists and outlets and it doesn't matter what Ackerman we're talking about NPR [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=160.62s)]
*  PBS NBC ABC CBS CNN MSNBC renounced any rules and norms and ethics of journalism and then [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=164.22s)]
*  proceeded to basically bear hug publicly what many of them always were privately political [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=170.94s)]
*  advocates and activists in the most insufferable and pious way possible and this posturing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=176.42s)]
*  was only compounded by the fact that their friends in the media all cheered each other [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=182.98s)]
*  on with likes and retweets which is the ultimate gold stars to those impossibly insecure and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=187.06s)]
*  attention star people and what this NPR piece shows Sean Mike is that they believed that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=191.66000000000003s)]
*  they were on the right side of history making their blind partisanship justified all while [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=197.10000000000002s)]
*  saving democracy they say from a man who they believe was worse than Hitler Stalin Mao Darth [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=202.5s)]
*  Vader and you know dark helmet combined Sean. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  Governor Huckabee if you know look at what we learned this week we saw that the Biden [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=212.18s)]
*  campaign was furious and they let the media know it because they weren't covering Donald [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=216.70000000000002s)]
*  Trump to their liking on the issue of abortion and all they did in this case was accurately [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  lay out what Donald Trump had said and then of course how many in the media are ignoring [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  death to America chants in Michigan and I think this is of grave importance because [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=235.06s)]
*  the Democrats and Joe Biden and their campaign they are scared to death a hundred thousand [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=242.5s)]
*  Democratic primary voters in Michigan didn't vote for Joe Biden 18.9 percent of those votes [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=246.98000000000002s)]
*  went against him 50,000 in Wisconsin so Joe Biden now would rather sell out our ally Israel [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=253.36s)]
*  in their war against terror the worst attack in their history so he would have a better [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=261.14s)]
*  chance of winning Michigan and Wisconsin and other states. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=265.85999999999996s)]
*  Wow that in and of itself should be a massive story. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=270.94s)]
*  Well it should be it's such a crass political position to take when the lives of Jewish [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=274.9s)]
*  people in Israel are literally on the line and here is a country the most freedom Democratic [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=282.29999999999995s)]
*  country in all of that part of the world the only one in fact and it's threatened with [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=289.94s)]
*  its very existence and Joe doesn't seem to really care it's stunning and here's the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=296.18s)]
*  White House yelling at the press telling them the story that they ought to be recovering [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=301.06s)]
*  and it makes me think of you know when you watch a basketball game and the coach goes [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=306.46s)]
*  and yells at the refs and suddenly all the calls start going differently I mean that's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=310.28s)]
*  what we're watching right before our eyes they're screaming at the striped shirts and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=315.34s)]
*  the striped shirts have decided take off the striped shirts put on a jersey and just go [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=320.46s)]
*  ahead and cheer for the home team and that's what they're doing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=325.38s)]
*  It's a great analogy Governor Huckabee Joe Consha thank you both we appreciate it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhCH1-EZQg&t=328.06s)]
