# Katie Britt: Biden's border policies have become a 'magnet' for illegal immigration
**Fox News:** [March 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E)
*  Now, last night, Alabama Senator Katie Britt delivered a rebuttal to Joe Biden's State of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=0.0s)]
*  the Union, and she joins us now with much more. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=5.16s)]
*  Senator, good to see you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=8.72s)]
*  Welcome to the program. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=10.68s)]
*  I hope you don't read social media, because whenever you do anything big like you did [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=13.0s)]
*  last night, it can be brutal. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=16.52s)]
*  Welcome to my daily world. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=18.88s)]
*  That's right, Sean. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=20.2s)]
*  My advice is never read it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=21.2s)]
*  Never read it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=23.28s)]
*  You know, Sean, last night I called people to get into the arena, and when you get in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=24.28s)]
*  the arena, you get arrows. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=29.04s)]
*  They get thrown at you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=30.92s)]
*  But it's worth it when you're fighting for the American people, when you are fighting [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=32.44s)]
*  to make sure that hardworking families, just like you said in your last segment, that they [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=35.6s)]
*  are seen, that they have a voice, that the things they're concerned about, that they're [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=40.04s)]
*  worried about, that we're actually talking about them. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Things that we talk about around our kitchen table, Joe Biden seems to be detached from [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=47.16s)]
*  reality, and somebody needs to bring him back in quick. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=51.96s)]
*  You know, I agree with that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=55.0s)]
*  I mean, first of all, were you as shocked as I was stylistically, I call him Jack Dub [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=57.4s)]
*  Joe, and him shouting and screaming the whole night? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=62.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  He was angry at best, seemed a bit incoherent with his messaging, and then wasn't truthful [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=68.64s)]
*  with the American people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=76.0s)]
*  You know, when I'm looking at the things he said, when he finally said Laken Riley's name, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=77.88s)]
*  finally said it, he then kind of stumbled and didn't actually take responsibility for [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=84.36s)]
*  what he has done. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=90.16s)]
*  We know that his policies, his decisions, the result of them is what we're seeing all [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=91.84s)]
*  across the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=96.6s)]
*  It is everything from fentanyl overdoses and poisonings to brutal murders. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=97.6s)]
*  And American people deserve better. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  And that's all on him, Sean. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, not only did he get Laken Riley's name wrong and call her Lincoln, even [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  though he had a button with her name on it right up there on the podium, which it's incomprehensible [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=113.04s)]
*  to me, not only did it get it wrong when he said there's thousands of legal people that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=119.68s)]
*  are killing innocent people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=125.04s)]
*  That's not the point, Senator, is it? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  No, no, not at all. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, look at his policies. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=131.52s)]
*  So he comes into office and his first 100 days in office, he executes 94 executive orders [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=132.8s)]
*  to undo President Trump's border policies. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=139.76s)]
*  We had the most secure border ever. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=143.12s)]
*  That's what Joe Biden actually inherited. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=145.12s)]
*  But he wanted to make a change. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=147.76s)]
*  He did that on day one when he said we are going to halt construction of the border wall. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  We're going to stop deporting illegal aliens. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=153.68s)]
*  And he said, you know what, we're going to give amnesty to millions. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=157.2s)]
*  When he did that and he changed these policies, they became a magnet for more and more people [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=160.58s)]
*  to come here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=165.02s)]
*  And when you look at the things that are happening, he refuses to give up the tools that he is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=166.06s)]
*  using that are abused, that he's abusing, that are ultimately hurting our nation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  And it's tools like parole. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=174.82000000000002s)]
*  I heard it mentioned earlier. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=177.02s)]
*  But if you look back under both President Trump and President Obama, they paroled on [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=178.66000000000003s)]
*  average about 5,600 people a year, Sean. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=184.18s)]
*  Well, President Biden actually just paroled 3,000 less than one million. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=189.1s)]
*  Those are blanket paroles without background checks. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=196.7s)]
*  It's completely and totally unacceptable. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  And it's putting the American people in harm's way. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=201.9s)]
*  Great job last night, Senator. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=205.26s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-BqVecak1E&t=206.85999999999999s)]
