# BREAKING: Byron Donalds announces candidacy for Florida governor
**Fox News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8)
*  All right, late last week, President Trump endorsed Congressman Byron Donalds for governor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=0.0s)]
*  of my free state of Florida. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=4.96s)]
*  But now Donalds has yet to announce his candidacy, but he is already receiving a lot of support. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=6.94s)]
*  However, it does look like an early fight could be emerging. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=12.72s)]
*  Reports in Florida suggesting that Casey DeSantis, Ron DeSantis' wife, is considering a run as [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=16.4s)]
*  well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=21.64s)]
*  Here with more, Congressman Byron Donalds. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=22.64s)]
*  Congressman, great to have you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=24.76s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=25.96s)]
*  It's good to be with you, Sean. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=26.96s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=28.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=29.72s)]
*  If you want to make any announcements to make, is truth? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=30.72s)]
*  I mean, you got the support of President Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=33.04s)]
*  Where do you stand? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=35.36s)]
*  Are you ready to make the plunge? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=36.36s)]
*  Well, look, Sean, after a lot of prayer, a lot of thoughts with my family and my friends, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=38.36s)]
*  I'm here to announce my candidacy to be the next governor of the great state of Florida. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=43.92s)]
*  And Sean, we have a wonderful state. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=48.28s)]
*  I got to Florida when I was 17 years old off of a Greyhound bus with just a trunk full [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=49.68s)]
*  of clothes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  And over the rest of my time in Florida, I built a family, I built a career, 17 years [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=55.82s)]
*  in financial services. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=60.74s)]
*  I joined the Tea Party movement, was in the conservative movement. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=62.300000000000004s)]
*  I was able to serve four years in the state legislature, four years in Congress. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=65.58s)]
*  And I think now is the time to now take the mantle and lead our state into the future. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=69.86s)]
*  We have a great governor. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=74.9s)]
*  Ron DeSantis has done a tremendous job for our state. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=76.14s)]
*  But now the job is to keep the best state in the country as the best state in the country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=79.12s)]
*  And so that's going to be the mission at hand, and I'm excited to announce my candidacy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=84.74s)]
*  with you tonight. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=88.58s)]
*  We, we appreciate the announcement. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  What do you make of the reports that the governor's wife is considering a run? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  She's a very well-liked first lady. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=99.14s)]
*  Well, I mean, honestly, right now, it's very early. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=101.13999999999999s)]
*  I'm the only person in this race right now, so we'll see what happens. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=104.66s)]
*  But I will tell you, Sean, I'm excited to have the full endorsement of President Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=108.14s)]
*  He has a lot of faith in me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=112.86s)]
*  And to the people of Florida, I would tell you that for a long time I've been in the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=113.86s)]
*  trenches in a lot of these battles dealing with conservatism. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=117.98s)]
*  A bill I passed when I was a freshman in the state legislature, Sean, allowed parents to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=121.66s)]
*  examine the materials in front of their children. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=126.62s)]
*  Then Governor Rick Scott signed that bill into law. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  So I have a long history in the conservative movement, and I have one of the strongest [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=133.3s)]
*  records both in the state house and up here in Congress that proves that I will not let [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=138.36s)]
*  you down, that all of the victories and the successes that Florida has been able to accomplish, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=143.36s)]
*  we're only going to take that and build upon it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  We're going to continue to be the freest state and the best state going forward. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=151.38000000000002s)]
*  What would you like to build on? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=155.36s)]
*  What would your, your agenda be? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=156.72000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, I have a vested interest in this living in the state that I love, that you've [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=159.28000000000003s)]
*  lived in since you were 17, as you said, and I've had property down here for almost three [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=163.84s)]
*  decades, for crying out loud. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's, for me, home. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=171.44s)]
*  And obviously, I have a vested interest in the state doing well. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=173.76s)]
*  Big shoes to fill. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=178.56s)]
*  I think Governor DeSantis has done a great job for the state. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=179.56s)]
*  And you know, what are the issues you see that you would want to maybe take to another [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  level? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=189.12s)]
*  Well, Sean, I agree with you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=190.12s)]
*  Governor DeSantis has done a tremendous job. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=192.76s)]
*  So, a couple of things. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=193.76s)]
*  First, we have an insurance problem in our state. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=194.76s)]
*  You know, my career in banking, insurance and in financial services, I want to make [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=197.84s)]
*  sure that we solve this problem for the people of Florida. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=201.76s)]
*  And it's going to mean bringing every stakeholder to the table, because the people of Florida [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=205.32s)]
*  is what's going to matter. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=209.76s)]
*  We got to solve it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=211.04s)]
*  We got to stabilize those costs. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=212.04s)]
*  I want to turn Florida into the financial hub of the world. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=213.48s)]
*  Digital assets has made a home in South Florida. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  I want to make sure that we become the most business-friendly state in our country, for [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=221.4s)]
*  businesses to incorporate in our state, but then also for the state to take the lead on [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  cryptocurrency and digital assets. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  I would even consider having crypto be a part of the state's financial portfolio. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  We're going to build on the work that Governor DeSantis did when it comes to our environment, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=236.56s)]
*  making sure that we finish the job on restoring the Everglades waterways, having clean water [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=240.8s)]
*  for all of our constituencies and for our environment. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=245.24s)]
*  And last but not least, education, Sean. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=249.96s)]
*  We've been doing a great job in our state, but my focus would be on making sure that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=251.68s)]
*  every child has the tools available to them to be proficient in math, in reading, in writing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=255.44s)]
*  and in reasoning. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=261.32s)]
*  Those are the things that are going to take our state from being great now to being even [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=263.0s)]
*  greater. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=266.68s)]
*  Last question. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=267.68s)]
*  Can you, I hate to lose one seat. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=268.68s)]
*  We're very close in the House in terms of margins. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=271.16s)]
*  Can you remain a congressman or run at the same time? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=274.58000000000004s)]
*  We only have about 20 seconds. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=277.16s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=278.16s)]
*  I'm not going anywhere. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=279.16s)]
*  We were, we really did a really good job passing the resolution tonight. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm here to make sure we get the president's agenda done. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=284.0s)]
*  So rest assured, I'm staying in place. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=286.68s)]
*  We're going to make sure we continue to fix Washington and make America great again. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=288.8s)]
*  All right, congressman. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=292.36s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=294.56s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=295.56s)]
*  We appreciate you making the announcement on our show. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK5vhTSHw8&t=296.56s)]
