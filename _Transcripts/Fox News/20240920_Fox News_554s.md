# Bombshell testimony: Ex-border patrol chief claims Biden-Harris tried to hide border crisis
**Fox News:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc)
*  Yesterday, in shocking testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee, a former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=0.0s)]
*  senior ranking Border Patrol official, Aaron Heike, alleged that the Biden administration [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=6.96s)]
*  intentionally covered up the border crisis. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  And in his testimony, Heike explained the lengths that the administration went to to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=16.56s)]
*  lie to the American people, conceal information from the media. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=22.04s)]
*  Now, take a look at this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=26.92s)]
*  For the first time in my 25 years, in under five different administrations, whether through [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=30.24s)]
*  neglect or on purpose, I saw a large-scale lapse in our ability to return people to their [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=34.56s)]
*  country of origin. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=38.76s)]
*  Simultaneously, in San Diego, we had an exponential increase in significant interest aliens. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=40.16s)]
*  These are aliens with significant ties to terrorism. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=45.68s)]
*  Prior to this administration, the San Diego sector averaged 10 to 15 SIA arrests per [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=48.68s)]
*  year. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=53.64s)]
*  Once word was out the border was far easier to cross. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=54.64s)]
*  San Diego went to over 100 SIAs in 2022, well over that in 2023, and even more than that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=57.36s)]
*  registered this year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=64.88s)]
*  These are only the ones we caught. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=66.68s)]
*  At the time, I was told I could not release any information on this increase in SIAs or [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=68.8s)]
*  mention any of the arrests. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  The administration was trying to convince the public there was no threat at the border. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  I had to release illegal aliens by the hundreds each day into communities who could not support [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=79.2s)]
*  them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  To quiet the problem, two flights a week were provided from San Diego to Texas. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=84.8s)]
*  These flights simply brought aliens that would have been released in San Diego over to Texas. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=89.08s)]
*  Each flight cost approximately $150,000. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  This was the administration's way to try and quiet the border-wide crisis. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=97.6s)]
*  Through pressure from the administration, my headquarters became more interested in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=101.92s)]
*  the fiction that being portrayed in the media and not at all concerned with reality. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=104.96s)]
*  Each time we asked for help in dealing with a new issue, it fell on deaf ears. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=109.64s)]
*  At times in San Diego, we had 2,000 or more aliens sitting in between the fences asking [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=113.96s)]
*  to turn themselves in. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=118.63999999999999s)]
*  I was told to move them out of sight of the media. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=120.44s)]
*  All right, here with more, former U.S. Border Patrol San Diego Sector Chief Aaron Heike. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=122.88s)]
*  So you were told to keep these illegal immigrants out of sight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=130.68s)]
*  At the same time, Harris, Biden, Mayorkas and every other administration official, they [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=136.64s)]
*  were telling the American people that the border is secure and the border is closed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=143.84s)]
*  So they basically were telling you to lie to the American people and cover it up on [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=149.3s)]
*  their behalf. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=155.06s)]
*  Is that an accurate description? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=156.06s)]
*  I think it's pretty accurate. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=160.86s)]
*  They wouldn't allow us to put out any information. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=162.78s)]
*  It was very frustrating knowing what was going on, knowing that there were large gaps in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=166.26s)]
*  the border coverage and that there were real threats there that we weren't able to address [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=171.1s)]
*  and that there were real threats entering our country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=176.16s)]
*  And who was telling you to do that? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=179.94s)]
*  It came through my headquarters, Border Patrol headquarters. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=184.1s)]
*  Okay, and they also prevented you from reporting the names and the actual number of illegal [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=188.38s)]
*  immigrants that had ties to terror. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=197.02s)]
*  And if that's the case, because we know there are hundreds of people with terror ties in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=202.18s)]
*  this country, we know that there are people, what, 11.5 million is now the number of people [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=206.74s)]
*  we know about, and then there, of course, there are the gotaways, but people coming [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=212.66000000000003s)]
*  from 180 countries, that would include our top geopolitical foes and countries with terror [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=217.82000000000002s)]
*  ties. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=223.5s)]
*  That would be Iran and Syria and Egypt and Afghanistan, and that would include Venezuela. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=224.64s)]
*  That would include tens and tens of thousands from Russia and China. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=230.73999999999998s)]
*  Am I correct about that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=234.76s)]
*  You are correct. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=238.55999999999997s)]
*  We are not allowed to put any information out on any of the individuals, whether it [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=239.55999999999997s)]
*  be the significant interest—significant increase in number of the significant interest [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=243.0s)]
*  or any information out that we had large gaps, area zones, entire zones across Texas, Arizona, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=249.44s)]
*  and California that had no agent presence for weeks at a time, was we have no idea what [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=256.88s)]
*  and who entered our country over that timeframe. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=262.48s)]
*  We weren't allowed to put that information out either. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=265.48s)]
*  If you couldn't put out the name and the numbers of people that had known terror ties, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=268.6s)]
*  what happened to those people? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=275.28s)]
*  Were they released into our country, even though you knew they had known terror ties? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  The actual end state for all of those people, I don't know where any of them ended up. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  If they had significant terror ties, we would turn them over to the FBI for further questioning, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  and then they would go over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for final determination. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=299.11999999999995s)]
*  I don't know the ultimate, but as many as there were and as much of it was going on, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=303.68s)]
*  likely many of them were released into the United States public. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=311.2s)]
*  Is it safe to say that you have knowledge that there are people from countries with [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=315.24s)]
*  known terror ties and people that have known terror ties themselves? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=321.28s)]
*  Is it safe to say that you are pretty confident that they have been released into our country? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=325.96s)]
*  I think it's safe to say that they are here for sure. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=331.8s)]
*  Between those numbers that came through, the inability that agents had to do proper questioning [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=337.0s)]
*  when because there were so many people that they had to deal with each day, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  that they slipped through the cracks and entered into our country, yes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=348.0s)]
*  So would it then be logical to conclude if people with known terror ties from countries [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=351.6s)]
*  with known terror ties that you were told to lie about, would it be logical to conclude [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=357.88s)]
*  that they're likely in this country plotting, planning and scheming another 9-11 attack or worse? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=364.32s)]
*  And if in fact that happens, would it be fair to blame Harris and Biden and Mayorkas for [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=372.32s)]
*  allowing this to happen? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=379.2s)]
*  And if Americans die, wouldn't they have blood on their hands? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=380.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, I think it's one of the things that keeps me up at night. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=385.6s)]
*  It's one of the things that keeps all the agents that I worked with up at night, knowing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=391.12s)]
*  that there are those threats that likely did and have come into our country that are here [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=395.36s)]
*  and that that is a much more likely possibility now with the inability to do the Border Patrol [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=402.0s)]
*  mission of national security over the last several years. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=409.88000000000005s)]
*  Were you forced to release illegal immigrants and pay for flights from your sector in San [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=414.76s)]
*  Diego to Texas? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=420.8s)]
*  And how much did those flights cost the American taxpayer? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=422.6s)]
*  And how many flights were there? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=426.0s)]
*  The flights started when we were releasing hundreds and sometimes a thousand, a thousand [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=430.44s)]
*  more people a day into downtown San Diego. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  We were given two flights a week from San Diego to Texas, a little over a hundred people [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=439.32s)]
*  per day or per flight. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  So twice a week to fly them to Texas to be released. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  When I asked why that was being done, I was told that there was a problem in Texas. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  There was not a problem in California. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=456.76s)]
*  We received those flights for about a month and then they stopped. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=460.02s)]
*  Once those flights stopped, we continued to release. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=465.8s)]
*  We had no choice. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=468.24s)]
*  I was told not to release anymore into San Diego. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=470.6s)]
*  My reply was that I cannot keep those people. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=475.68s)]
*  Once a person is determined to be released, it is a Fourth Amendment violation to hold [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=479.72s)]
*  them in detention. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  They must be released. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=485.62s)]
*  And so I told my headquarters that I would not stop releasing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  So basically, they put you in a position that you had to violate what the laws of this country [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=491.84s)]
*  are because last I checked, you're not allowed to enter the country without approval. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=496.84s)]
*  And then you became, in that sense, they put you in a position where you had to release [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=502.8s)]
*  them into the sanctuary state of California. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=507.14s)]
*  But Aaron Heike, thank you for being honest with the American people and telling them [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=509.48s)]
*  the truth. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=514.0s)]
*  It's important they know. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=515.0s)]
*  And I'll add that when they got here, that now Kamala supports decriminalizing them, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=516.88s)]
*  getting them on a path to citizenship, after they get free housing, healthcare, education, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=522.72s)]
*  and if they want a free sex change operation. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=529.08s)]
*  And in Minnesota, you get a legal driver's license and you get a free college tuition [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=532.1600000000001s)]
*  paid for you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuXZdYo3Lnc&t=536.4s)]
