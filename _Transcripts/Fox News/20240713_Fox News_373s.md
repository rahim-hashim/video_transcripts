# Tammy Bruce: Dems have spent all their energy covering up the fraud of the Biden presidency
**Fox News:** [July 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY)
*  All right. We are only three days away from the RNC convention and that has taken place [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=0.0s)]
*  in Milwaukee. Tonight, polls are looking good for Donald Trump as we take a look at them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=6.46s)]
*  A new ABC news poll asking voters who they trust more to handle the economy. 45% Trump, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=11.0s)]
*  35% Biden. Who's the 35%? Anyway, voters will also ask who they trust on inflation. 44 Trump, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=17.8s)]
*  Biden. These numbers are very telling. 89% of Americans say the economy is highly important [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=25.8s)]
*  to their vote. And by the way, on immigration, how does anyone ever give Joe Biden any score? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=31.36s)]
*  Here with reaction is Fox News contributor, Tammy Bruce, the president of Citizens United, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=37.0s)]
*  co-chair of the RNC convention himself, Dave Bossie, who will be debuting next week at the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  convention. A new movie is coming out. It's called Trump's Rescue Mission, Saving America. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=49.4s)]
*  And the only thing I'm mad about is that I didn't get an early copy because he's saving, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=56.16s)]
*  apparently, the debut. When is that happening? Sean, we're going to debut this film Wednesday [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=61.92s)]
*  afternoon at the convention in Milwaukee. And we're honored to have President Trump himself [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=70.72s)]
*  coming to introduce the film. We're really excited about it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=75.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I'd love to be there, except it's during my radio show. So thanks a lot. I really appreciate [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=79.12s)]
*  it. There's a lot of competition in Milwaukee. That's true. No doubt about it. Tammy, as we look [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  at these polls, what do they tell you? Look, it's clear that the American people have their [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  priorities correct. They know that what matters are policies, right? We've been dealing with a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=99.04s)]
*  great deal from the Democrats trying to demonize Donald Trump and perhaps his personality with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=104.88s)]
*  also accusations about fascism and totalitarianism, vague kinds of threats, if you will, about the end [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=111.92s)]
*  of the world and the doomsday dynamic if he's elected. And yet we remember his presidency, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=119.24s)]
*  and it was the opposite. It was peace and prosperity. That is what Donald Trump brought us [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  versus now, which is chaos here at home and around the world. It is an astounding difference. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=131.6s)]
*  And Americans know that this is about policies. It's about what you're going to accomplish. It's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=138.16s)]
*  about what you stand for. It's about the values. But most of all, Sean, it is the things that you [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=143.04s)]
*  bring about when you actually love the country. And with the meltdown going on with the Democrats [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=148.96s)]
*  right now, it's obvious that's never been a factor for them. They've spent all their energy [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=154.56s)]
*  covering up the fraud of the Biden presidency, trying to demonize Donald Trump. And keep in mind [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=160.8s)]
*  what July 12th was really supposed to be, Sean. It was going to be the day that Donald Trump was [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=166.4s)]
*  in prison. He was supposed to be sentenced yesterday under their scheme, which of course, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=172.8s)]
*  through the Supreme Court ruling, got a little bit of a roadblock. It did not happen. It's like [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=178.24s)]
*  humans make plans. People make plans and God bless. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=185.36s)]
*  And they introduce evidence in thatâ€”didn't they introduce evidence in that case [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=188.96s)]
*  from the time he was president? Wasn't that a part of the evidence presented to the jury? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=193.68s)]
*  That case has to be thrown out, vacated. Well, that's it. There's going to be appeals [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=198.56s)]
*  and he'll be successful. But this was their plan. They had no plan to be able to explain Biden's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=203.44s)]
*  policies, to be able to explain Biden. None of this would have mattered. They've known forever [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=209.6s)]
*  that it's been impossible with him. But the polls show that the American people are not distracted. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=214.56s)]
*  They care about their families and they want to make, frankly, the future great again. And [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=220.56s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to be the one who brings that forward. Great analysis. Dave, let's get [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=225.84s)]
*  your take on the polls and maybe you can give us a preview of what we're going to see next week in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=232.16s)]
*  Milwaukee. You know what? First of all, Tammy just, in her outstanding monologue there, just [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=237.12s)]
*  described what our film is about. It is exactly what she's talking about. It is Joe Biden's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  and the left's horrendous policies. And that's why the polls are showing [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=251.52s)]
*  that Donald Trump is so strong right now in all of the battleground states where it matters. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=256.4s)]
*  And so what we show in our film, and you can go to TrumpsSavesAmericaMovie.com, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=261.76s)]
*  go there right now, take a look at the trailer, take a look at the film, you're going to be educated, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=269.76s)]
*  you're going to figure out exactly why Donald Trump is the solution to America's problems. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  We are in the most important election of our entire lifetime, not just our lifetime, America's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=280.72s)]
*  lifetime. We have a consequential election that is going to determine the future of America, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=287.2s)]
*  and we have to have Donald Trump back in the White House. Now, the convention next week, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  we are so excited about what we're going to bring nominating Donald Trump to be the 47th president [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=297.36s)]
*  of the United States, and we're super excited about whoever he picks. The short list is exciting. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=304.4s)]
*  I've been in Milwaukee all this week. People are incredibly excited, both in Milwaukee and delegates [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=311.36s)]
*  that are coming from around the world, around the country, and the media that's coming from around [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=318.0s)]
*  the world, to see the show that the Republican Party puts on for the American people to show [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=323.04s)]
*  the differences between the radical left and the normal Republican Party. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=330.88s)]
*  Amazing. It's kind of also amazing. 115 days to election day, 66 days away from early voting [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  that starts in Pennsylvania and then rolls out around the country. Anyway, we'll look forward to you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=346.24s)]
*  Sean, 56 days. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=351.04s)]
*  By the way, thanks for the early copy. I really appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Just kidding. Thank you, Dave. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  Tammy, great to see you as always. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=359.68s)]
*  As we catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axPnogVaVmY&t=366.48s)]
