# 'Hamilton' creator is 'intolerant' to the GOP, Kennedy Center director argues
**Fox News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU)
*  When you think Democrats can't possibly get any more insufferable, just think again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=0.0s)]
*  After Rick Grinnell was appointed to lead the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=4.88s)]
*  hysteria has been well through the roof. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=9.72s)]
*  In fact, the producers of the Broadway show, Hamilton, have now canceled their scheduled [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=12.44s)]
*  performances at the Kennedy Center as an act of defiance. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=17.56s)]
*  Big deal. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=22.12s)]
*  Here with more, the special presidential envoy for special missions of the U.S. and the new [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=23.12s)]
*  director of the Kennedy Center, Rick Grinnell is with us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=28.04s)]
*  Rick, first of all, it's been a while. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=31.6s)]
*  Great to have you back. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=33.12s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=34.12s)]
*  Very proud of you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=35.12s)]
*  Happy that you are in the administration. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  I don't care that they canceled. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't care anybody that cancels. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=44.08s)]
*  Bring in country music stars. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=45.08s)]
*  I'll go to the Kennedy Center. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=46.6s)]
*  I'll watch that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=48.04s)]
*  Well, first of all, Sean, thanks for having me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=49.04s)]
*  It has been a while and it's great to be back here on Fox. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=53.6s)]
*  Look, the reality is the Kennedy Center is open for business for everyone. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  We just want an art center that celebrates arts. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  We want common sense art. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=65.16s)]
*  We think that it's time to invite every single person to the Kennedy Center. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=68.36s)]
*  But one important thing to note, we issued a statement tonight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=73.18s)]
*  The new team at the Kennedy Center has not canceled anyone. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=76.62s)]
*  I know there's some rumors out there that somehow we were canceling shows. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=81.88s)]
*  We have not canceled anyone. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=85.14s)]
*  They've pulled out themselves or they were told that due to ticket sales, it wasn't [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=86.86s)]
*  financially good enough. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=92.58s)]
*  And they decided to back out because they were concerned about the finances. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=93.82s)]
*  And so we want a Kennedy Center that is open to everyone. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=98.54s)]
*  And what that means is, is that shows like Hamilton are going to have to allow Republicans [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=101.7s)]
*  to buy tickets. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=106.5s)]
*  But Lin-Manuel said, I don't want to have Republicans coming here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=107.58s)]
*  I don't want to be in a space where Republicans are coming to my shows. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=111.98s)]
*  I think that's intolerant. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=116.54s)]
*  And that's one of the things that Donald Trump has really brought back into Washington, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=118.22s)]
*  into America, into the Kennedy Center, is to say everyone is welcome. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=123.34s)]
*  We're not going to cancel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=127.86s)]
*  We're not going to tell people that they're not welcome. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=129.02s)]
*  Everyone is welcome. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=132.34s)]
*  You know, it's such a good point. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=133.34s)]
*  By the way, I want people of all political points of view to watch this show. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=135.82s)]
*  I invite them to watch this show. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=140.06s)]
*  I invite them to call my radio show. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  I am not opposed to vigorous debate with people, although it gets a little monotonous, because [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=144.54s)]
*  they often lie and they don't have facts behind them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  And it gets a little frustrating for an audience that, generally speaking, is cut above in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=154.78s)]
*  terms of their intelligence, I would argue, which is my audience. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  And I give them a lot of credit. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  When you talk about anybody who's going to be invited, who would you—you know, what [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=166.5s)]
*  are—what are shows, what kind of people are you thinking about inviting? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=170.66s)]
*  Well, first of all, we're looking at everybody. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=179.18s)]
*  We're trying to make sure that shows are popular and they actually make money. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=181.18s)]
*  Look, there are times when you have to educate people on the arts. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=186.10000000000002s)]
*  And we can do that if we actually have the money. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  The person who had the job before me was making $1.4 million a year. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=193.06s)]
*  There was zero money in the bank. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=197.94s)]
*  There was zero in reserves. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=201.10000000000002s)]
*  And we were paying the employees through debt reserves. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=203.06s)]
*  Now, that's just not smart. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  We can't continue to have an arts center that is making financial decisions that keep [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=208.9s)]
*  getting us into the hole. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=215.74s)]
*  So we need popular shows. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=217.58s)]
*  We need shows that the public is going to come to. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=219.22s)]
*  So I'll give you one example. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=222.06s)]
*  We had one show cancel from December 7th through January 4th, over Christmas. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=223.66s)]
*  And so I said, you know, let's do a big show celebrating the birth of Christ at Christmas. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=230.06s)]
*  That seems like something that would be really popular. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=235.1s)]
*  And so we have an amazing show that is going to be at the Kennedy Center. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=237.26s)]
*  I can't give you details yet. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=242.17999999999998s)]
*  We had several meetings on this and a big one today locking this in. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=244.38s)]
*  The announcement of who's going to be there to celebrate the birth of Christ at Christmas [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  at the premier arts center in America, in Washington, D.C., the Kennedy Center. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=255.22s)]
*  We couldn't be more excited about it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=261.06s)]
*  And Donald Trump is somebody who is looking at making drastic change in Washington, including [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=262.46s)]
*  here at the Kennedy Center, so that everyone is included and that we make good financial [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=268.5s)]
*  decisions for the public who supports these programs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=272.94s)]
*  If anyone has ever been around Donald Trump, he loves to play DJ. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=277.06s)]
*  And when he does, he plays an eclectic blend of music. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  And he's not—there's no litmus test for what their political views are. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=283.94s)]
*  He'll play anybody. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=287.74s)]
*  He likes to play Sinead O'Connor, for example, just off the top of my head. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=288.74s)]
*  Anyway, Rick, we're glad you're back and great to have you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  And please come on off, and we appreciate your time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  We'll watch this very closely. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=298.58000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwUvzEcaaU&t=306.98s)]
