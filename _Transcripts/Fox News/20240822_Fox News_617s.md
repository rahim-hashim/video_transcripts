# Sean Hannity: Democrats hope you ignore this
**Fox News:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4)
*  despite a promise of happiness and joy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=0.0s)]
*  The theme in this building all week has frankly been nothing but hatred and loathing. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=3.74s)]
*  Democrats hoping that you hate Donald Trump as much as they do. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  And that has been and remains the theme every single night, and it will be so tonight. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=13.94s)]
*  They want you to hate Donald Trump so much you will even vote against what is in your [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=19.44s)]
*  own best interest, policies that will improve the economy and secure our borders, bring [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=24.46s)]
*  back law and order and safety and security to your town and city and bring you lower [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=29.78s)]
*  energy prices and of course reestablish America's role in the world. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=34.5s)]
*  They hope that your hatred of Trump will blind you to the Harris Biden border crisis. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=38.74s)]
*  You know, people with known terror ties in this country confirm, people from countries [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=43.38s)]
*  with terror ties are top geopolitical foes, Iran, Syria, Russia, China, Egypt, Afghanistan. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=48.56s)]
*  They hope that you ignore that Kamala would like to decriminalize illegal immigration, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=55.26s)]
*  give free housing, health care, education to illegal immigrants. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=60.46s)]
*  They hope you're not going to notice a running mate is allowing illegals to get legal driver's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  licenses and offering in Minnesota free college education, courtesy of the taxpayers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  And of course they both support sanctuary cities, states and states, and they both want [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  amnesty. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=81.3s)]
*  Or what they call a pathway to citizenship, which would be amnesty. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=82.34s)]
*  They want you to hate Donald Trump so much that you ignore all the crime in small towns, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=86.1s)]
*  big cities. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=93.14s)]
*  They want you to ignore all of the unvetted Harris Biden illegals that we know have been [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  involved in raping and murdering and other violent crimes against Americans. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=99.3s)]
*  13 year old girl, Queens, New York, Park, broad daylight, raped. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  Of course, Lake and Riley, Jocelyn Nungary, 12 year old girl, tortured for two hours [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=109.22s)]
*  and murdered. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=116.1s)]
*  She fought back with all of her might. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=117.66s)]
*  Or maybe Rachel Moore and Mother of Five and the list we scroll it so often of the names [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=120.62s)]
*  you've never heard of before, unvetted Harris Biden illegals. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=125.1s)]
*  They're hoping you hate Trump more than wanting to solve that problem. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=128.5s)]
*  They hate that you, they want you to hate him so much that you're going to forget about [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=132.9s)]
*  the wars raging overseas happening in large part because of their weakness on the world [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=137.66s)]
*  stage. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=142.1s)]
*  And they'd love that your focus only be on the rage they have for Trump projected onto [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=143.38s)]
*  you more than you would say, hate what you see when you go into your local grocery store, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=149.32s)]
*  paying more for everything you buy, every store you go to, costs higher. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  Harris Biden inflation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=160.74s)]
*  Bidenomics is great, Kamala was telling us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=162.22s)]
*  Now she's complaining about the high cost of things like bread and eggs, et cetera. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=164.82s)]
*  Or what about, for example, the high gas prices, electricity prices, energy prices? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=170.26s)]
*  It's just killing American families. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=175.1s)]
*  Two thirds of Americans now saying they're gulping water financially. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  And of course, they're really hoping that you hate Donald Trump so much that you want [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=180.94s)]
*  more of your hard earned money to go for their cradle to grave, womb to the tomb, Green New [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=186.9s)]
*  Deal, because Kamala co-sponsored that bill and Medicare for All with no private health [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=191.94000000000003s)]
*  insurance and, you know, obviously showing herself to be the radical and revealing her [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=198.66000000000003s)]
*  true self. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=203.82000000000002s)]
*  For example, look at this headline. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=205.06s)]
*  This is from tonight. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=206.38000000000002s)]
*  According to the New York Times, Kamala Harris is poised to enact what would be, pay attention, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  the biggest tax hike by far in the history of America in terms of sheer dollars, the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=213.7s)]
*  biggest tax hike she is proposing in the entire world. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=222.1s)]
*  I can't even believe that they have put this forward. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=227.5s)]
*  Pay attention to the details. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=230.7s)]
*  It will impact in spite of what they claim. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=232.29999999999998s)]
*  Anybody that has a 401k or an IRA or retirement, whatever you have. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=234.82s)]
*  And it's, you know, it includes five trillion dollars they want in new taxes, previously [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=240.9s)]
*  rejected by Congress. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=248.74s)]
*  But that's even when Democrats control both chambers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=250.58s)]
*  The difference is this is a new radicalized, you know, socialist slash communist Democratic [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  Party. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=261.46s)]
*  Kamala wants to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 percent. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=263.06s)]
*  And by the way, remember corporations, small businesses, they don't pay taxes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=267.54s)]
*  They pass those higher costs on to all of you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  So you will cover that bill. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=275.14000000000004s)]
*  Every time you go to a store to buy anything, you'll be paying yet more again. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=276.92s)]
*  She's proposing a hike on income taxes and small business taxes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=281.5s)]
*  That includes an initial raise on Americans making, they say over $400,000 a year, but [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=285.38s)]
*  it includes anybody. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=292.38s)]
*  And then in 2025, she plans on letting the Trump tax cuts expire. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=294.1s)]
*  That'll cause taxes to go up for almost all Americans, including families making under [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=298.94s)]
*  $100,000 a year. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=304.5s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=306.72s)]
*  Kamala also wants to raise the Medicare surtax. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=308.06s)]
*  She's also planning to raise the capital gains tax. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=310.66s)]
*  Look at this from 15 percent to 20 percent to as much as 39 percent. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=313.94s)]
*  That will destroy investment in America. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=320.22s)]
*  It might crash the stock market too, and the housing market on top of it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=323.22s)]
*  She's endorsing a tax hike on stock buybacks. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=328.3s)]
*  She wants something called a global minimum tax. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=331.8s)]
*  She wants it to go from 10 percent to 20 percent. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=334.86s)]
*  Why are we paying for global anything? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=338.18s)]
*  That's where the U.S. and Europe, they kind of get together and they collude and they [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  conspire and they together come up with the same corporate tax rate to prevent competition [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=346.62s)]
*  among countries for businesses and investment. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=352.34s)]
*  Why do we ensure a high tax rate in perpetuity? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=355.14s)]
*  Again, this tax gets passed on to all of you in the form of higher prices. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=357.9s)]
*  And so much, by the way, for making America a tax safe haven for people around the globe [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=363.5s)]
*  to invest here because this is the best place to invest. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  That would take away our competitive advantage. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=372.02s)]
*  Now Kamala has also invented a brand new tax on something called unrealized gains. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=374.58s)]
*  OK, slow down. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=380.5s)]
*  Newt spoke to this earlier. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=382.06s)]
*  If you have a 401k or you own a house, or you have business or some stocks, which most [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=384.41999999999996s)]
*  Americans have in any retirement account, the values of those assets, let's say they [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  go up on paper, oh, my stocks went up 15 percent. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=396.46s)]
*  You'd have to pay an annual tax on that even though you didn't get a penny. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=400.78s)]
*  You didn't realize the gain. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=405.94s)]
*  And when you sell it, what if the stock had gone down on the interim? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=407.62s)]
*  You're going to get a refund? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=411.74s)]
*  I tend to doubt it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=412.74s)]
*  And you'll have to cut a big check every year on unrealized profits from any asset you have. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  If you bought a house for, say, 200 grand in the 90s and the house is now worth a million [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=420.14s)]
*  dollars, well, get ready to come up with some cold hard cash if Kamala gets her way. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=424.98s)]
*  And God help you, if you're a farmer or a rancher, your entire life will be destroyed. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=429.94s)]
*  If you bought into a mutual fund, prepare for your portfolio to drop in value while [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=435.14s)]
*  your investment company is forced to sell off stocks in order to pay for that massive [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=439.62s)]
*  tax bill. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  You have a 401k that you paid into your entire life and you're still getting money and the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=444.97999999999996s)]
*  value of it is going up and you want the value to go up so you can retire and have some financial [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=452.14s)]
*  peace of mind. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=457.38s)]
*  OK, as that value continues to go up and you get ready to cash it in, every year you're [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=458.38s)]
*  going to be paying an annual tax. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=463.62s)]
*  The big lie, they're not going to tax people under $400,000 a year. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=465.7s)]
*  The market crash from this is almost unimaginably possible. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=471.38s)]
*  Now, same with the real estate crash. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=477.5s)]
*  And again, commoners say this plan is only intended for wealthy people. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1iAc40HmU4&t=480.32s)]
