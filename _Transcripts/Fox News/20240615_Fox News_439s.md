# Gov. Ron DeSantis: We don't let the inmates run the asylum in Florida
**Fox News:** [June 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg)
*  And now, with more, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor, look, there's a lot of reasons I moved here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=4.14s)]
*  And I've been wanting to do it for years, but certain commitments prevented me from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=6.46s)]
*  doing so. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=10.5s)]
*  Let's see, better infrastructure, better weather. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=11.5s)]
*  You actually believe in law and order. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=14.32s)]
*  You have better schools for less money. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=16.32s)]
*  You have lower taxes, by far. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=18.72s)]
*  And especially compared to New York City, not where I lived in Long Island, the people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=22.38s)]
*  are a hell of a lot nicer, especially to me. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=27.259999999999998s)]
*  It was a pretty hostile environment for me, walking through the streets of New York City, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  I got to tell you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=34.22s)]
*  Oh man, Sean, we should make you an ambassador for Florida. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=36.22s)]
*  That's a Chamber of Commerce presentation right there, and you've only been a resident [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=40.739999999999995s)]
*  for six months. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=44.86s)]
*  No, just think about it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=45.86s)]
*  One thing we don't have, we don't have double-double animal style in Florida. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  In-N-Out has not come this far east, and they may never do. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=52.06s)]
*  But I also think that with California's current policies, if In-N-Out were just starting [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=55.58s)]
*  right now, they probably wouldn't have been able to succeed like they did back when California [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=60.5s)]
*  was a prosperous state. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=65.82s)]
*  And you're right, your former state in New York has millions fewer people than Florida [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=67.62s)]
*  now, yet our budget, the budget I signed into law today, actually reduces spending from [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=72.5s)]
*  last year and is less than half of New York's budget. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=78.02s)]
*  But anyone that's driven in New York roads and Florida roads know we have better infrastructure, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=82.1s)]
*  we're ranked number one in education, and we have the lowest per capita tax or debt [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=87.1s)]
*  burden in the country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  And I've paid down 36 percent of our state's total debt from the entire history of Florida, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=95.06s)]
*  36 percent of the taxpayers' supported debt. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=101.58s)]
*  So we're doing it right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=104.1s)]
*  But even as we're reducing spending, Sean, we are using tax dollars prudently to expand [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  infrastructure, because I've got people moving here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=111.34s)]
*  We want to get ahead. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=114.1s)]
*  So we're going to end up accelerating road projects by between seven and 15 years that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=115.1s)]
*  we're in the pipeline because we're prudently using resources. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=120.58s)]
*  We have the most education spending we've ever had, largely driven by our school choice [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  scholarships, which is really important. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=129.62s)]
*  And we're raising pay for teachers and providing bonuses for law enforcement. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=131.82s)]
*  So we're doing the things that I think taxpayers expect. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=135.82s)]
*  We're very prudent with what we're doing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=139.94s)]
*  And our state has a triple A credit rating. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=142.14s)]
*  That's something that the federal government can't match. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  Double double animal style. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=148.46s)]
*  If In-N-Out wants to come to Florida, I will invest heavily in them moving here if they'd [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=150.06s)]
*  ever want a partner. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=156.34s)]
*  I'd be glad to. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=157.78s)]
*  It would be my honor to. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=158.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=160.26s)]
*  Sean, if they decided to come to Florida, they would print money in the state of Florida. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=161.26s)]
*  It would be so successful. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=167.18s)]
*  I think the company, they like being where they are, and I respect that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  But they certainly would do very well in Florida. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  I have friends of mine, they have Chicken Salad Chicken out of Tampa, Florida. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  They have five, six restaurants now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=181.38s)]
*  It's killing it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=183.26000000000002s)]
*  They work there now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=185.02s)]
*  They're killing themselves because they work really hard, but it's doing phenomenal. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=186.02s)]
*  And I couldn't be happier. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=190.26000000000002s)]
*  Lindsay and Paul are friends of mine. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  They do great. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  But here's my next question. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  The New York Times fact-checked you, didn't they? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=196.98s)]
*  And they fact-checked you on the issue of whether or not terrorists were crossing the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  border under Joe Biden's open border policies, unvetted illegal immigrants from our top geopolitical [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  foes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=211.54s)]
*  I've mentioned the list of countries over and over. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=212.54s)]
*  I think they owe you an apology, Governor. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=215.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I said this last fall that, and it wasn't even just me spitballing, Biden's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=218.42s)]
*  own DHS has acknowledged there were hundreds of people on the terror watch list. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=225.54s)]
*  Sean, you can't have 10 million people come and not have potential terrorists come across [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=230.26s)]
*  the border, especially when you have people from the Middle East. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=236.06s)]
*  So now we know without a shadow of a doubt that we have ISIS folks who have been identified [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=238.46s)]
*  and apprehended. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=243.7s)]
*  The New York Times was wrong. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=245.06s)]
*  The New York Times was pushing forth a narrative. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=246.62s)]
*  They were running interference for Joe Biden. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=250.02s)]
*  What I said was correct at the time and it remains correct today. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=252.28s)]
*  But I am not going to hold my breath asking for an apology. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=256.16s)]
*  I think a lot of these corporate media outlets, it's drive by journalism. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=259.8s)]
*  They say what they want and then they just forget about when it's obvious they were wrong. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=263.72s)]
*  When you debated Governor Newsom on this program and we went issue by issue, we went over the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=268.84s)]
*  issue of crime, we went over the issue of taxes, we went over the issue of spending [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=273.42s)]
*  per capita, education and results. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=278.12s)]
*  You were number one in the country and you spent far less money than California did. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=280.44s)]
*  On every single statistic, Florida is outperforming. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=284.84s)]
*  And this is common in a lot of red states, but Florida is doing particularly well. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=289.62s)]
*  Why do you think so many people are allowing the government? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=294.4s)]
*  For example, you get an income tax in California if you're a couple making $84,000 a year, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=297.54s)]
*  you're still paying 6.5% income tax out there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=304.76s)]
*  Now you're not paying the full 13.5%, but that's a serious amount of money for a couple, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=308.0s)]
*  especially with the cost of living out there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=313.0s)]
*  They absolutely hammer middle class families and small businesses in California. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=317.04s)]
*  That's why a lot of them have fled to Florida. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=322.48s)]
*  Used to never happen that people would really leave California because the weather is so [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=324.44000000000005s)]
*  great and they've got all these great natural advantages, but they're now doing that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  But I'll tell you this, Sean, in terms of education. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=333.12s)]
*  K-12, for example, we believe in education. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=335.36s)]
*  California believes in indoctrination. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=339.56s)]
*  They are using their schools, the teachers unions are using the schools to impose a left [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=342.04s)]
*  wing political agenda on the students. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=347.6s)]
*  First of all, that's wrong. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=349.86s)]
*  Second of all, that's not how you have good performance. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=351.64s)]
*  And I'd also say this, we're ranked number one in higher education now for public university [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=353.64s)]
*  system, and we have the same philosophy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think that universities should fulfill their classic mission of pursuing truth, academic [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=363.36s)]
*  rigor, and preparing students to be citizens of a republic. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=369.12s)]
*  They should not be indoctrination camps like Columbia University. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=372.24s)]
*  And when we had these pro-Hamas people at our universities that tried to set up a tent, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=376.56s)]
*  they were kicked off in 10 minutes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  We didn't let the inmates run the asylum. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=384.44s)]
*  And I think people take notice of that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  Who who maybe in the past would not have thought Florida for higher education, they say, why [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=388.84s)]
*  go to Columbia and be treated like that when you can go to Florida? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=393.08s)]
*  We're the Harvard for the unwoke now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=397.67999999999995s)]
*  By the way, Governor, if the owners of In-N-Out would be willing to meet with you and me, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=400.84s)]
*  I will go with you and I will raise as much money as humanly possible to get them to move [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  to the great state of Florida because I want to get back to my new home state. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=414.28s)]
*  I would like to do that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=419.8s)]
*  And I would love to have a double double. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=420.8s)]
*  We are going to deliver this to In-N-Out corporate. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpknGWB8oyg&t=426.48s)]
