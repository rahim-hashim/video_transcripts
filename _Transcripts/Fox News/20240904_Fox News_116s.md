# Donald Trump: If Kamala Harris wins, there will be no fracking
**Fox News:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY)
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=0.0s)]
*  adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=5.2s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=9.52s)]
*  So would you ban offshore drilling? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Yes. And I've again worked on that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=14.88s)]
*  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, you're a better businessman than I am. Isn't energy, fracking, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=21.12s)]
*  oil the lifeblood of the world's economy? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=27.84s)]
*  So the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cannot even take a chance because that's the real [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  opinion from her. Now, the whole country would go down the tubes if you didn't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=39.36s)]
*  do the fossil fuel thing. It just would go. And you can do all sorts of other things, but [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=43.28s)]
*  Germany tried it and it lasted for about nine months and they were going to go down the tubes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=48.56s)]
*  entirely and somebody else came in and I hate to say they're building a coal plant every single [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=52.64s)]
*  week, every week, and they're building nuclear and they're doing a lot of things. It's never worked. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=59.04s)]
*  It never will work. But Pennsylvania can't take a chance that that answer is true. But she's been [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=64.08s)]
*  there for 20 years. That's what she's been saying for a long time. And she will do that. There's no [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=70.64s)]
*  chance that she's going to allow it. The election will take place. If she won, you're not going to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=76.0s)]
*  have any fracking in Pennsylvania. You have 500,000 jobs. Think of that. It's your biggest [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=81.2s)]
*  business and you get a big majority of your income from fracking and you have somebody that's not [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=86.64s)]
*  going to allow fracking. She's not going to allow it. You can't take the chance. You have no choice. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  You've got to vote for me. You've got to vote for me. You got to. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7JLDGoydzY&t=98.64s)]
