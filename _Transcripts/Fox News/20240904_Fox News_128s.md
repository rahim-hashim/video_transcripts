*  Right. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=3.92s)]
*  Our prayers are with our friends in Georgia. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=4.92s)]
*  And I've been doing town halls and interviews in public with you for all these years since [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=7.36s)]
*  you got into the political arena. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=11.64s)]
*  And I told this audience, never before have restrictions been so tight, obviously after [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=13.4s)]
*  the assassination attempt as well. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=19.84s)]
*  And Director Reyes said the threat level has never been this bad. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  He said it five consecutive times before Congress. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=25.32s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's a sick and angry world for a lot of reasons. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=29.799999999999997s)]

*  We're going to get rid of all these wars that are starting all over the place because of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=38.0s)]
*  incompetent American leadership. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=42.28s)]
*  And we're going to make it better. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=45.28s)]
*  You know, Victor Orban made a statement. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=47.28s)]
*  They said bring Trump back and we won't have any problems. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=50.08s)]
*  He was very strong about that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=52.8s)]
*  So we're going to hopefully do very well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=57.4s)]
*  We have an election coming up. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=59.4s)]
*  And actually, you know, they keep saying 60, but it starts in Delaware and North Carolina [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=61.8s)]
*  and other places a lot sooner than that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=67.64s)]
*  So we're going to be I think we're going to be very well set up to do a great job. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaGEPBVqj4&t=69.88s)]
