# Hannity: Kamala Harris is 'testing out' a new word
**Fox News:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI)
*  Also tonight, we will preview Kamala's bizarre trip tomorrow to the border. The borders are. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=0.0s)]
*  Might as well make the trip. Maybe she'll even go to Europe 39 days before an election. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Got to give her credit. That is a bold political move. Now, first she lied to all of us [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=11.36s)]
*  for three and a half years. Oh, the border's secure. The border's closed. The border's secure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=16.8s)]
*  The border is secure. She said it over and over again. Then Kamala said she didn't need to visit [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=20.56s)]
*  the border as borders are. She hadn't been to Europe, so Europe, get ready. Kamala might be [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=26.64s)]
*  coming. Then she blamed Donald Trump for the border crisis. Now she's headed to the border [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  for a campaign photo op with 39 days to go because it has become such a liability for her. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=36.96s)]
*  Earlier today, President Donald Trump had this to say about Kamala's border folly. Take a look. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=42.56s)]
*  She should save her airfare. She should go back to the White House and tell the president to close [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=48.96s)]
*  the border. He can do it with the signing of a of a just a signature and a piece of paper to the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=57.6s)]
*  Border Patrol. Instead, she's going there to try and convince people that she wasn't as bad as [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=62.88s)]
*  everybody knows. She was she was the worst in history. They undid all of Trump's successful [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=68.4s)]
*  border policies with a stroke of a pen, as the president said. Well, they can bring him back with [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=75.12s)]
*  a stroke of a pen. Forget the trip to the border. Go to D.C. Wake up, Joe. Have him sign it. The [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=80.48s)]
*  border can be secure tomorrow. We're going to have a lot more on the border czar, V.I.P.s big trip [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=86.0s)]
*  to Arizona. Yep. Thirty nine days before an election. Now straight ahead. That's coming up. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  But our top story is something that has not received a lot of attention on other, well, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=97.76s)]
*  let's call them the state run media mob networks. Last night, the vice president went on MSDNC for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=102.96s)]
*  her first and only national solo interview of the campaign. It was with a friendly left-wing host [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=108.96s)]
*  who wants Kamala to win, which is fine, and asked a lot of softball questions. They didn't really go [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  on very long. Very few follow ups. It did not go well. Here's Kamala testing out a big new word [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=119.52s)]
*  holistically. Listen. Some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=127.28s)]
*  giving benefits and assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=134.56s)]
*  and looking holistically at the connection between that and housing and looking holistically at the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=139.6s)]
*  incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=146.32s)]
*  engage in planning in a holistic manner that includes prioritizing affordable housing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=150.72s)]
*  Okay, I'll play. How about a holistic look at Kamala's disaster at our border? Millions of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=157.84s)]
*  people let in, unvetted into this country, causing, let's see, a spike in housing demands. We have [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=164.24s)]
*  four-star hotels, New York City, around the country. They're filled. They're being destroyed, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=171.44s)]
*  paid for by you, the American taxpayer. School districts, they're running out of money because [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=176.08s)]
*  of a massive spike in enrollment, predominantly in already high-need schools. Then, of course, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=181.12s)]
*  you have the problem of, you know, English as a second language, and that means American kids are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=187.68s)]
*  getting a lot less attention because of the influx of Harris-Biden unvetted illegals and their kids [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=192.96s)]
*  and the healthcare system. They're also overloaded by the increased demand. They're now under [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  financial stress because patients, they don't have insurance. You're paying for that, too. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=204.08s)]
*  And increased demand on welfare and charities. And that also means that American citizens that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  are veterans, they're not getting the assistance they need. There's not enough money to go around. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  And then there's a spike in drug trafficking, driving fentanyl prices down from $10 a pill [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  to 25 cents a pill, which means more Americans are dying, drug prices crashing. Why? Caused by a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  spike in the use and record number of overdose deaths. And hundreds of individuals connected to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=231.92s)]
*  terrorist groups have crossed that border, completely unvetted, and I'm sure they're plotting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  and planning and scheming. And it's not a matter of if. It's a matter of when another 9-11 or worse [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  happens. And I pray to God I'm wrong, but I know I'm not wrong. Small towns, big cities, they have [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=249.83999999999997s)]
*  seen a spike in crime, and the South American and Venezuelan street gangs taking over areas [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=255.2s)]
*  untold numbers of women and children and some men smuggled across the border being kept as sex slaves. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  They are being forced into prostitution. You have dozens of families have lost loved ones due to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=268.4s)]
*  illegals, let's see, murdering their loved ones. Dozens of women and children have been raped [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=274.0s)]
*  because of Harris and Biden and unvetted illegal immigrants coming into this country. And of course, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=280.96s)]
*  hundreds of other Americans victims of other violent crimes. Holistically, she has been a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=287.04s)]
*  disaster. Instead of a three and a half year late photo op trip to the border, how about she followed [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=293.44s)]
*  Donald Trump's advice, go back to DC, give Joe a pen, wake him up, and all those Trump policies that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  were working that he undid and you bragged about undoing, too many to name as you once said. Well, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=307.36s)]
*  how about you put them back in place immediately, but don't hold your breath. Now, last night, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=313.52s)]
*  Kamala flat out couldn't even answer a basic, simple, fundamental question from one of her [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  sycophant supporters at MSDNC. Take a look. Expanding that child tax credit or you mentioned [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  housing before giving that extra money for a first home. If you can't raise corporate taxes or if GOP [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=330.88s)]
*  takes control of the Senate, where do you get the money to do that? Do you still go forward with [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=337.2s)]
*  those plans and borrow? Well, but we're going to have to raise corporate taxes and we're going to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=341.44s)]
*  have to raise, we're going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=348.24s)]
*  pay their fair share. That's just it. It's about paying their fair share. I am not mad at anyone [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=355.68s)]
*  for achieving success, but everyone should pay their fair share. Kamala, corporations don't pay [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=361.52s)]
*  taxes. They charge more for their goods and their services. Maybe economics 101 would be a good idea. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=369.52s)]
*  Now, later on MSDNC, even her sycophantic interviewer Stephanie Ruhl had to criticize [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=375.76s)]
*  Harris for not answering any questions. The New York Times even, you know, they weren't even [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=381.84s)]
*  impressed writing, quote, Ms. Harris responded to the fairly basic, predictable questions [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=387.52s)]
*  with roundabout responses that did not provide a substantive answer. Kamala even got fact checked [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=392.96s)]
*  by fake news CNN after lying about Trump's record on manufacturing jobs. Everyone, even those who want [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=399.2s)]
*  her to win, I don't know who they are, understand that Kamala is a terrible candidate as she was a [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  terrible and not well-liked vice president and even a worse border czar. Her track record is bad. Her [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=411.68s)]
*  beliefs are extreme and radical and frankly, if implemented, dangerous. Her rambling and, you know, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=417.68s)]
*  meaningless platitudes and bumper stickers and word salads make no sense. Kamala Harris is a danger [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=424.64s)]
*  to the entire system of governance and capitalism as we know it, a blend of incompetence and New [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=431.44s)]
*  Green Deal Marxist radicalism. The Harris campaign, meanwhile, makes little to no effort to clarify [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=438.24s)]
*  her true positions or they just flat out lie about what she really believes because providing [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=444.96s)]
*  taxpayer-funded sex change operations for illegal immigrants or people in prison, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=450.56s)]
*  that's not a winning message, but that's what Kamala supports and based on her own words, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=456.8s)]
*  we have the evidence. She also supports what? Rewarding illegal behavior, not respecting our [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  laws, border sovereignty, give you a pathway to citizenship, that's called amnesty, along with the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  sex change surgery and housing and healthcare and education. You didn't respect our laws. Take a look [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=473.76s)]
*  at your screen. Look at all of the other radical positions that she has taken and has never been [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=479.68s)]
*  questioned about, banning private insurance, no fracking, no offshore drilling, eliminate the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=485.12s)]
*  filibuster to pass the $93 trillion Green New Deal. She supports gun confiscation, but she's [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=491.12s)]
*  packing and you better not break into her house. She's going to blow you away. Just ask Oprah. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=497.68s)]
*  And wants to raise taxes on all Americans, even taxing unrealized capital gains, which is [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=502.32s)]
*  a tax on theoretical money you haven't even made yet. This would spell the end of capitalism, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=509.12s)]
*  the end of the American dream, capitalism, the greatest wealth creating system in the history [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=515.52s)]
*  of mankind. It's only the tip of the iceberg. Kamala Harris, these policies are extreme, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=520.4s)]
*  radical and if implemented, they are dangerous. She is a radical Marxist that wants to be [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=526.48s)]
*  president without telling you what she really thinks or believes. Now it's not theoretical, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=532.72s)]
*  by the way. We know what her presidency would look like. The southern border was her responsibility. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=537.6s)]
*  She was supposed to find the root causes. She failed and she failed miserably. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx8i-X0eQsI&t=543.28s)]
