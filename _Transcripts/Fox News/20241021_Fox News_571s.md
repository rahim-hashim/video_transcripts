# Sean Hannity: Trump is promising to clean up this mess
**Fox News:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho)
*  And tonight, with just 15 days to go, we have officially entered the closing argument phase [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=0.0s)]
*  of this presidential election year, and the message from each campaign could not be any [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=6.54s)]
*  more different. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=11.46s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump focused like a laser on bringing down costs, bringing down [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=12.46s)]
*  crime, securing the border, becoming energy dominant, making the world a safer place for [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=17.32s)]
*  all. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=23.0s)]
*  In other words, he's promising to clean up the mess caused by Joe and Kamala Harris. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=24.0s)]
*  This isn't a negative campaign. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=29.0s)]
*  Every single day he's on the ground connecting with Americans from all walks of life. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=30.8s)]
*  I love this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=35.28s)]
*  Over the weekend, Donald Trump got down to business at a local McDonald's outside of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=36.28s)]
*  Philadelphia where he worked the fry machine, handed out food at the drive-through, talked [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=40.9s)]
*  to people, and he looked like he was having a good time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=46.32s)]
*  I see a lot of joy in this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm looking for a job, and I've always wanted to work at McDonald's, but I never did. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm running against somebody that said she did, but it turned out to be a totally phony [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=58.52s)]
*  story. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  Turn it up. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  Keep it tight. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=64.68s)]
*  You've got the salt on it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=65.68s)]
*  Never touches the human hand. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=66.68s)]
*  Very good, very good. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=67.68s)]
*  Nice and full. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=68.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=69.68s)]
*  Good. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=70.68s)]
*  Do another one. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=71.68s)]
*  This is all on Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=72.68s)]
*  Oh, hold on. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=73.68s)]
*  I'm allowed to do that, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=74.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=75.68s)]
*  Let's check and make sure it's everything he said it would be. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=76.68s)]
*  It better be. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=77.68s)]
*  It's going to be the best you ever had. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=78.68s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be the best you ever had. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=79.68s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=80.68s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=81.68s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=82.68s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=83.68s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=84.68s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=85.68s)]
*  It's going to be the best you ever had. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=86.84s)]
*  I made it myself. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=87.84s)]
*  Now I have worked. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=88.84s)]
*  I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=89.84s)]
*  Now, the funny part is, if you know Donald Trump in real life, and I've known him way [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=94.84s)]
*  before he ever ran for president, he does love McDonald's. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  So do I. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=102.04s)]
*  Anyway, no scripts, no teleprompter. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=103.04s)]
*  A tie, an apron, a frying machine. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=104.04s)]
*  Trump got to meet workers, talk to supporters, folks from Fun and Kamala Harris, and the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=107.04s)]
*  people of Pennsylvania, they were really happy to see him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=114.08000000000001s)]

*  Steelers game, where the crowd broke out into very loud chants of USA. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=133.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=139.16s)]
*  45th president of the United States, Donald Trump, in attendance tonight, invited guests [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=140.16s)]

*  USA USA USA USA PLUS USA USA. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=147.22s)]
*  And on the ground the enthusiasm was also very real, and our very own Sarah Carter caught [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=156.24s)]
*  up with tailgaters. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=162.16s)]
*  And here's what they had to say about the upcoming election. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=163.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=166.48000000000002s)]

*  I mean, this is everybody's got eyes on Pennsylvania. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=169.08s)]
*  What is your feeling based on what you're seeing? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=171.66s)]
*  I'm seeing that Trump's going to win it, but I don't know. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=174.26s)]

*  President Trump win. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=207.54s)]
*  Put it in a parlay. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=208.54s)]
*  $1,000. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=209.54s)]

*  Policy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=222.74s)]
*  It's all about policy, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=223.74s)]
*  It's about what he says and what he does and he backs it up and he's going to do the same [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=224.74s)]
*  damn thing when he wins the election again. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=228.54s)]
*  I love the people of Pittsburgh. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=231.54s)]
*  This morning, only a few hours after the game, Trump headed back to North Carolina to get [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=232.82s)]
*  an update on recovery efforts, talk to the victims of Hurricane Helene, where many people [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  lost everything and Joe and Kamala, of course, their preparation response, maybe the worst [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  in hurricane history. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  In contrast, Kamala Harris was campaigning on stage with Madam Joy herself, the ever-so-dour, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=249.7s)]
*  the perpetually angry Liz Cheney. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  And just a quick reminder for Liz Cheney, because maybe she thinks that Democrats, maybe [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=260.94s)]
*  she believes in her heart that they like her. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=265.54s)]
*  And maybe she believes that she has a new home in the Democratic Party. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=268.46s)]
*  Liz, let me burst the bubble. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=272.34s)]
*  No, they hate you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=274.78s)]
*  And they've always hated you and your family. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=276.82s)]
*  They called your father a war criminal, evil, every other nasty name they could think of. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=279.26s)]
*  They accused him of corruption with his work with Halliburton. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=284.42s)]
*  And Democrats are just simply using Liz Cheney and have been for years. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=287.94s)]
*  They don't agree with Cheney's beliefs and policies, and they don't trust her. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=292.06s)]
*  And Liz Cheney's hatred of Donald Trump has caused her to completely abandon every stated [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=296.74s)]
*  belief she's ever had on both economic and foreign policy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=303.18s)]
*  Now, Kamala's closing message? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=307.1s)]
*  It's not about beliefs. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  It's not about policies, as that last person told Sara Carter. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=310.38s)]
*  It's not about her track record, because she can't run on whether or not this country [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=314.22s)]
*  is better off than we were four years ago, because, for a very simple reason, by every [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=319.58000000000004s)]
*  measure we are far worse off. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=326.06s)]
*  The border is not secure. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=328.94s)]
*  It's become the biggest national security crisis probably in our country's history, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=330.98s)]
*  and it's self-inflicted. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  Prices on everything you buy and every store you go to are up dramatically. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=337.98s)]
*  Time is up dramatically, and our country and the world is not a safer place. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=343.26s)]
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=348.98s)]
*  But most Americans, they're going to answer overwhelmingly no. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=352.18s)]
*  Kamala can't ask that question or run on that position. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=355.98s)]
*  Her position is on raising taxes, defund, dismantle, reimagine police and ICE and getting [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=359.3s)]
*  rid of ICE and decriminalizing illegal immigration and offering everything for free to illegals, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=364.7s)]
*  including sex change operations if they want it, eliminating private health insurance, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  government health care for all, and banning fracking and drilling. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=376.66s)]
*  You know, all of her core values are extreme. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=380.5s)]
*  They are radical, if implemented. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=383.38s)]
*  We won't recognize the United States of America as we know it today. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=385.3s)]
*  And so her closing argument, with the help of the ever-so-happy Liz Cheney and the state-run [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=389.62s)]
*  media mob, Donald Trump is a monster. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=394.74s)]
*  Or as The Atlantic put it, quote, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=398.58000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump is speaking like Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=400.26000000000005s)]
*  The joy is gone. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=404.42s)]
*  Kamala's coronation is not going according to plans. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=405.74s)]
*  So now, as Miranda Devine so eloquently wrote in The New York Post, Dems are so fearful, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  they're now in the Trump is worse than Hitler stage as election day nears. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=414.46000000000004s)]
*  I wish I wrote it that eloquently myself. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=419.42s)]
*  Now, the cries of racism and sexism and xenophobia and transphobia, homophobia, are reaching [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  Oh, and Republicans want dirty air and water, and they want to take grandma and grandpa's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  Social Security away. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=433.0s)]
*  Others are accusing Trump of wanting to overthrow democracy and arrest his enemies. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=434.8s)]
*  This from a Democratic party that waged a silent coup against Joe Biden after he won [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  the primary by millions and millions and millions of votes, and then installed Kamala Harris [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  as the party's nominee after they threatened to use the 25th Amendment to push Joe out, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=449.64s)]
*  and she received herself zero votes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=454.84s)]
*  Democrats have another backup plan, though. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  If their attacks on Trump fall flat, they'll send out celebrities. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=460.36s)]
*  They've been sending out, let's see, the Clintons, the Obamas and Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=463.96000000000004s)]
*  Not working too well. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  The Obamas had to leave their Martha's Vineyard mansion to scold the American people, specifically, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  quote, the brothers, about being, quote, sexist, and they're making big promises. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=475.32000000000005s)]
*  But they can't hide from a simple truth. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=481.16s)]
*  For the past three and a half years, crime, inflation has strained businesses and every [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=483.68s)]
*  American in every corner of our country. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  So while Kamala and her celebrity friends vilify Donald Trump and compare him to Hitler [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=492.0s)]
*  and Stalin and Mussolini, etc., the former president's on the ground talking to Americans, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=497.3s)]
*  including recently when Trump visited a barbershop in the Bronx in New York with Lawrence Jones. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=503.2s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=509.48s)]
*  Do you believe at some point in time we could find a way once the country's back on its [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=510.48s)]
*  feet and getting enough revenue and paid off our debt? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=514.36s)]
*  Do you think it's possible to find a way to eliminate federal taxes for — [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=517.36s)]
*  There is a way. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=520.32s)]
*  There is a way. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=521.32s)]
*  And how do you feel about — [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=522.32s)]
*  You know, in the old days, when we were smart, when we were a smart country, in the 1890s [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=523.32s)]
*  and all — this is one of the countries who was relatively the richest it ever was. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=527.96s)]
*  It had all tariffs. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=531.96s)]
*  It didn't have an income tax. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=532.96s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=533.96s)]
*  OK? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=534.96s)]
*  Now we have income taxes and we have people that are dying. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=535.96s)]
*  They're paying tax and they don't have the money to pay the tax. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=538.4s)]
*  No. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=541.28s)]
*  In the old days, 1890, 1880, we had so much money. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=542.28s)]
*  They had to set up committees, blue-ribbon committees, how to spend our wealth. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=546.68s)]
*  We had no idea how to spend it with so much money. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=551.0s)]
*  Then we went to the income tax system and the rest is sort of history. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=553.88s)]
*  But no, there is a way. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=556.8s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K8QVA1Ffho&t=568.4s)]
