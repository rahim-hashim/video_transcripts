# Ron DeSantis: We're putting our assets into place to protect Florida
**Fox News:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI)
*  Just recently, within the last couple of weeks, and this will be made public later today, our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=0.0s)]
*  Florida Fish and Wildlife officers interdicted a vessel that had 25 illegal immigrants, potential [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  illegal immigrants from Haiti, in their boat, in their vessel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=16.92s)]
*  They had firearms, they had drugs, they had night vision gear, and were boating very recklessly, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=20.2s)]
*  which would potentially endanger other folks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=27.76s)]
*  So that vessel was interdicted near the Sebastian Inlet, and those illegal aliens were turned [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=30.16s)]
*  over to the Coast Guard for deportation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=38.08s)]
*  Now this comes only days after the governor announced that he would be sending soldiers, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=41.68s)]
*  aircraft, and boats to protect Florida from Haitian illegal immigrants. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=46.08s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis joins us now with more. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  First of all, before we get to this specific case, and the drugs and the guns and even [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=55.36s)]
*  night vision equipment, which should scare everybody, let me first take note of the fact [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=59.44s)]
*  you're not even counting on Joe Biden to help you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=65.72s)]
*  You just acted, you know, with the situation rapidly deteriorating in Haiti, knowing that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=69.52s)]
*  the likely outcome of that would be an influx into this country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=76.44s)]
*  You didn't go to Joe Biden because you knew that he would not be willing to uphold the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=80.2s)]
*  laws of our country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=85.36s)]
*  You've watched what's been happening in Texas and Arizona and California, and you said, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=87.16s)]
*  no, it's not going to happen here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=91.68s)]
*  What does that say about Joe Biden? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=93.2s)]
*  Well, look, Sean, you know, we take matters, you know, we step up and do what we need to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=95.48s)]
*  do in Florida. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=102.88s)]
*  I don't expect necessarily to get the help that I think we're entitled to. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=103.88s)]
*  And what we found over the last several years is the Coast Guard, they do a good job. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=108.2s)]
*  They're just way under resources. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=112.68s)]
*  Biden will not provide the number of vessels that they need to interdict all the ships [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=114.44s)]
*  that come. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=118.76s)]
*  So I did, I've been supplementing their efforts for years now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=119.76s)]
*  I did an executive order in January of 2023, so about 15 months ago, where we declared [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=123.56s)]
*  it a state of emergency and we surged a lot of vessels. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=129.9s)]
*  So since January of 2023, our state assets have stopped 660 vessels, not all from Haiti, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=133.88s)]
*  but from other islands in the Caribbean. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=140.12s)]
*  And we've interdicted 13,580 illegal aliens. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=142.72s)]
*  So that's just leading to this point. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=147.88s)]
*  Then our executive order that we did this week is supplementing those efforts. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=150.16s)]
*  So we have the strongest protection that our shorelines have ever had. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=154.8s)]
*  Yes, we did interdict the one boat that had the 25 Haitians that were trying to come illegally [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=160.12s)]
*  with guns and drugs. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=164.84s)]
*  We have not, though, seen yet a massive influx of boats into our region. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=166.48s)]
*  And I think part of that is because people know if you take that journey, you're going [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=172.56s)]
*  to get stopped and you're going to end up back where you started. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=177.4s)]
*  So it's not worth it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=180.72s)]
*  One of the things I think that may be different from this situation, from when this has happened [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=182.06s)]
*  in years past, is Haitians know the easiest way to get into our country is actually not [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=186.1s)]
*  to take a boat and to land illegally in Florida anymore. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=191.02s)]
*  It's to fly to Mexico and to just walk across the border. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=194.9s)]
*  There have been tens of thousands of Haitians who have done that illegally. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=198.78s)]
*  So I think the dynamics are unique, but the bottom line for us is we want to be prepared. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=202.78s)]
*  I was asked today at our press conference, why are you doing this when there has not [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=207.78s)]
*  actually yet been a massive influx? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=211.9s)]
*  And I say, what are you supposed to do, wait for it to happen? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=214.86s)]
*  So we're putting our assets in place to be able to defend the state. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=217.38000000000002s)]
*  Well if you had waited, then the drugs and the guns and the guys with night vision, the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=222.78s)]
*  25 that you apprehended, they would have made it to your shores. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=226.82000000000002s)]
*  That would have been acting too late. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=231.5s)]
*  This is a predictable outcome that we're going to expect out of Haiti, as politically [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=233.02s)]
*  things have deteriorated very badly there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=237.58s)]
*  I have to give you, you know, I'm sure you probably already know this, bad news. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=240.38s)]
*  You can pretty much be assured that Joe Biden and his Department of Justice will be suing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=245.22s)]
*  you like they've been suing Greg Abbott and any other state that tries to fill the void [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  and enforce the laws that Joe not only won't enforce, but aids and abets in the breaking [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=256.74s)]
*  off. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=262.82s)]
*  Well, I think you're exactly right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=263.82s)]
*  So we have the vessels that we're going to enter Dick, which is important, but one of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=266.26s)]
*  the things Biden's been doing is he's been abusing this concept of parole, where he's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=270.94s)]
*  actually flying in illegal aliens and dumping them in different parts of the United States. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=275.96s)]
*  So for example, there was the news today of an illegal immigrant from Haiti who was now [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  arrested or accused of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old with disabilities in Massachusetts. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=287.06s)]
*  And that was somebody that Biden flew into this country, didn't even cross illegally. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=293.86s)]
*  Biden flew him over the border. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=299.14s)]
*  So that is a unique circumstance. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=301.02000000000004s)]
*  I don't think we've had any president that has flown in this many illegal aliens into [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=302.86s)]
*  our country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=308.54s)]
*  So there's a lot of facets to this, but we are doing what we have every right to do, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=309.54s)]
*  and that's defend the people of Florida. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=315.3s)]
*  Governor, if you did that, if I did that, I can pretty much assure you that we would [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=318.14s)]
*  be arrested, fingerprinted, handcuffed, and we'd be sitting in a jail cell somewhere. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=323.3s)]
*  That's called human trafficking. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=328.38s)]
*  It's amazing, but it's also sad. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=330.8s)]
*  But more importantly, it is extraordinarily dangerous for our country, especially look [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=332.98s)]
*  at the countries we know people are coming from, Iran and Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=337.94s)]
*  China, Russia. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=342.38s)]
*  Not a good situation, but as the gangs now take over Haiti and that situation worsens, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=345.22s)]
*  I would assume this is going to get far worse. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=350.32s)]
*  And I have to assume that you're on top of this and ready for perhaps even a much larger [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=353.88s)]
*  influx, which would mean a lot more interdiction efforts on the part of your staff, the people [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=361.04s)]
*  that you have out there on the waterways. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  Another facet to it, Sean, is we have Florida citizens who are in Haiti and trying to get [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=375.32s)]
*  out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=380.8s)]
*  So I've authorized rescue flights like we did in Israel after the October 7th, because [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=381.8s)]
*  we've got a lot of folks who are part of Christian missionary groups, and they do things to try [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=386.36s)]
*  to actually help a very troubled country. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=391.48s)]
*  So they really are doing good work. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=395.6s)]
*  They need to get out. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=397.56s)]
*  So we're working on that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=398.72s)]
*  We don't want to say anything too publicly about what exactly we're doing until it happens, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=400.04s)]
*  because it's a very dicey situation. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=403.6s)]
*  But we do feel an obligation to go in and help Florida citizens who are caught in the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=405.56s)]
*  crossfire of a very difficult situation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=412.0s)]
*  But I think you're right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=414.76s)]
*  I think you're going to see it get worse. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=415.76s)]
*  And what I would say is the U.S.'s role in other countries should be to offer support [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=417.46000000000004s)]
*  to Haiti to stabilize it there, not to have a million people end up showing up in the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=422.52000000000004s)]
*  United States or neighboring countries. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=428.5s)]
*  I don't think that's an answer. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=430.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_07GM3lBZI&t=432.08s)]
