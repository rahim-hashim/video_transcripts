# Trump lawyer: They have not proven their case
**Fox News:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA)
*  Here now with more, Trump's legal spokesperson, Alina Hobbs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=0.0s)]
*  She was in the courtroom today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=3.04s)]
*  Alina, let's get your overall take. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  As I'm sitting there today, Sean, all I keep thinking is they've sold tickets to all the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=7.76s)]
*  Democrats in America who have Trump Derangement Syndrome for a show that, frankly, when the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  curtain opened, just didn't happen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=16.4s)]
*  So I hope you all get a refund. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=18.68s)]
*  That is what is happening right now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=20.26s)]
*  And the only thing I'm hearing is accusations of somebody who paid their lawyers to hide [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=22.28s)]
*  something — we haven't heard that yet, by the way. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=26.96s)]
*  Do you know who did pay their lawyers to hide something, Sean? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=29.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, with the Russia hoax. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=31.96s)]
*  And the FEC investigated, and she had to pay a fine — $8,000, something like that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=34.24s)]
*  There was no trial. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=39.36s)]
*  You know why? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=40.6s)]
*  Because this is election interference. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=41.6s)]
*  Do not get it twisted. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=43.52s)]
*  What we are seeing is 100 percent them afraid that Trump is and probably will beat them. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=45.08s)]
*  He is beating them in court. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=51.84s)]
*  He is not campaigning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=53.84s)]
*  And it is petrifying everybody that has done wrong against any Republican and, frankly, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=55.24s)]
*  Americans in this country. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=60.32000000000001s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=61.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=62.84s)]
*  So where do you see the trial? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=63.84s)]
*  As you sit there every day — and, again, unless you can identify it for me, I don't [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  even know what the second charge is. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=70.68s)]
*  I've yet to see any evidence that Donald Trump committed any crime. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=72.72s)]
*  Every respectable legal scholar that I know, even people on fake news CNN and in the mainstream [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=78.56s)]
*  mob media, they're recognizing, as a matter of law, there is no case. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=84.72s)]
*  However, what is the reality that you're facing, the president is facing, and everybody's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=91.64s)]
*  facing? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=96.84s)]
*  And that is a New York City jury, you know, where nine out of 10 New Yorkers are registered [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=97.84s)]
*  Democrats and most don't like Donald Trump and didn't vote for him in 2020. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=103.6s)]
*  So that's the reality of what he's facing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=108.64s)]
*  I don't think this was a fair venue. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  I don't think he can get a fair trial. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=112.91999999999999s)]
*  I don't think this is a fair judge. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=114.6s)]
*  And I think it's all playing out the way probably Alvin Bragg hoped it would. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, that's 100 percent right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=120.91999999999999s)]
*  They intentionally choose these venues. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=123.28s)]
*  If you look at all the venues that he's been carried and indicted into, they're all blue [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=125.13999999999999s)]
*  areas, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=129.04s)]
*  D.C. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=130.6s)]
*  Look at what's happening with Fannie. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=131.6s)]
*  And we're slowly, like I said, the curtain opens and there's no show, and we have to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=133.56s)]
*  peel it open like that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  But the key is that we have to make sure that the jury is listening and the jury is applying [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  law to fact, because there has not been. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  There's been a lot of noise, Sean, but there has not been any proof of any wrongdoing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=146.88s)]
*  There has not been any proof that President Trump, who was in the White House, knew what [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=151.48s)]
*  an accountant was booking a payment to a lawyer as, a legal expense, which, by the way, isn't [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  wrong. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=160.44s)]
*  But they want to make you feel like it's wrong. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=161.44s)]
*  They'll put in noise. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=162.8s)]
*  They'll bring in witnesses that are salacious. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=163.8s)]
*  They will do that on and on and on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  And if the jury is not capable of listening to that jury instruction and really listening [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  to limiting instructions and able to block out testimony that frankly shouldn't have [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=173.4s)]
*  come in, we're going to have a problem. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=177.08s)]
*  But I'll tell you right now, President Trump has done nothing wrong and they have not proven [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=179.3s)]
*  their case, as I sit here today on day 17. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=182.52s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=186.28s)]
*  There's been some speculation as to how many witnesses the defense will call. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=187.28s)]
*  I've even heard maybe one, maybe not any, maybe as many as 10. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=192.66000000000003s)]
*  Can you give us any insight as to what the thinking is? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, Sean, as you know, I am Team Trump. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=201.74s)]
*  I support my defense team ad nauseum, and they're doing amazingly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=204.22000000000003s)]
*  But if I were to divulge anything about our strategy, I'd frankly be unethical, much [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  like some of the people we've been hearing from in the news. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=213.74s)]
*  And I'd also be just frankly a bad attorney. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=216.86s)]
*  So I'll let you sit tight. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, you can't blame me for asking. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  No, I cannot. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  Okay, Alina, we appreciate you as always being with us. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZri-LyARzA&t=222.14s)]
