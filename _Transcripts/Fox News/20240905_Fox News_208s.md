# Donald Trump: ABC News is ‘very nasty’
**Fox News:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng)
*  So we have all of this. Now, let me talk about, in six days, you will have probably your only [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=0.0s)]
*  opportunity to debate Kamala Harris. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=6.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=8.28s)]
*  If I — I vote instead of George Stephanopoulos' network that I get to moderate the debate. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=9.28s)]
*  Just saying. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=17.28s)]
*  But in all — [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=18.28s)]
*  I have to say — [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=19.28s)]
*  ABC is not — [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=20.28s)]
*  John, ABC is the worst network in terms of fairness. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=21.28s)]
*  They had a poll where I was 17 points down a couple of days prior to the election. I [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  was 17 points down in Wisconsin. And they do that so people don't vote, because, you [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=38.56s)]
*  know, hey, I love Trump, but he's 17 points down. I'm not going to go out and vote. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=43.68s)]
*  I was 17 points down, and I won. And I called the biggest — the best pollsters and said, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  why wouldn't they say five or four or three? Because at three, you go and vote. At 17, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=53.52s)]
*  your people say, I want to vote, but, you know, I'm busy. I have other things to do. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=59.2s)]
*  Let's go see a movie, and we'll watch the results later. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=63.92s)]
*  They are the most dishonest network — the meanest, the nastiest. But that was what I [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=67.4s)]
*  was presented with. I was presented with ABC, George Stephanopoulos. You know who he is. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  And he's a nasty guy. And yet, he's a nasty guy. I've had him up to here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  But let me tell you — let me tell you, he's a very, very bad kind of a guy. But I watched [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=89.36s)]
*  his interview of Joe Biden. It was, like, the softest interview I've ever seen. It was softer [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=96.48s)]
*  than the CNN interview of Kamala. So — but they're very nasty. And I think a lot of people [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=103.68s)]
*  are going to be watching to see how nasty they are, how unfair they are. I agreed to do it [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  because they wouldn't do any other network. She — she — the other thing is, her best friend [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=114.8s)]
*  is the head of the network. Her husband's best friend is married to the head of the network. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=120.24s)]
*  And they're going to get the questions. I've already heard they're going to get the questions [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  in advance. They even have Donna Brazile. Remember Donna Brazile? She gave — Donna Brazile — she's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  another real — she's the real beauty. Donna Brazile, she gave Hillary Clinton the questions. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=139.84s)]
*  You remember that? And she works for ABC, and she's at the roundtable talking about the debate. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=147.76s)]
*  So I — we're going to watch very closely, but you're not allowed to do it. We even have a clause [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=153.84s)]
*  in the contract. You can't give them the questions, but I probably — I'm not sure it's going to help [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=160.0s)]
*  her that much, though. I really — I think you might give her the questions and give her the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=164.88s)]
*  answers with the questions. I'm not sure it's going to help her. I don't know. All right. Now, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=169.76s)]
*  so unlike Kamala Harris, our time is actually up. However, we are — we're going to let Dave [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=175.84s)]
*  McCormick ask the first question, and we're going to air that not tonight, but tomorrow night. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  He always does this, yeah. I do. Our time's up. But you know what? Let's make two shows out of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=189.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxzFwkVBng&t=194.88s)]
