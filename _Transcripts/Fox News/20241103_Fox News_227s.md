# Gianno Caldwell: Democrats are running scared
**Fox News:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc)
*  New York Governor Kathy Hochul is the latest Democrat to disparage GOP voters on MSDNC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=0.0s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=5.76s)]
*  Hochul said that if you're voting for Republicans, you're not only anti-women, you're anti-American. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=6.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News political analyst Giano Caldwell, along with outkick founder [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Clay Travis. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=19.2s)]
*  Clay, we start with you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=20.2s)]
*  So anti-American, anti-woman, you're garbage, you're a Nazi, you're a fascist, you're a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=21.2s)]
*  racist. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  I'm just a piece of trash. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  I don't even know what to do with this anymore. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=31.16s)]
*  Is there any other names they want to call us? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=35.32s)]
*  Remember when Kamala was going to have an entire campaign based on joy and the effervescent [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=38.04s)]
*  quality of her innate American virtues? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=46.64s)]
*  And now it's just basic name calling. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=50.08s)]
*  And Sean, on Halloween night in my neighborhood, everybody was dressed up in garbage bags, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  everybody was dressed up in the safety vest that Donald Trump was wearing and their Make [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=58.48s)]
*  America Great Again hats. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  I think this has been a huge gift for turnout for everyone out there who is hearing what [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  they really think about you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=69.66s)]
*  If you didn't already early vote and the early vote numbers are phenomenal, get out, get [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=71.56s)]
*  all your friends and family out on Tuesday and send Kamala Harris and Joe Biden a message [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=76.2s)]
*  once and for all about exactly what you think of them by sending them both into political [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=81.6s)]
*  retirement. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=86.16s)]
*  And Gianna, she said to Trump supporters and Lee Zeldin supporters, get on a bus, get out [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=89.16s)]
*  of town, get out of town. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  And her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, if you're one of those conservatives that is pro-life [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=97.12s)]
*  and pro-sort weapon, you're not a New Yorker and there's no place for you in New York. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=104.4s)]
*  OK, so I left. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=109.84s)]
*  And I'm a full time resident, as you know, domiciled, homesteaded in Florida. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  And I've sold my house. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't live in New York anymore. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  I left. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=121.16s)]
*  So, if I'm not wanted, why should I stay? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=122.16s)]
*  Exactly right, Sean. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=126.84s)]
*  And welcome to Florida. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=127.84s)]
*  And I got to tell you, there's billions of dollars that left out the door in New York [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=129.0s)]
*  City. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=132.56s)]
*  This is what's going on, Sean. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=133.56s)]
*  The Democrats are running scared because they recognize that they're losing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm a single issue voter this year. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  My vote is on crime. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=140.52s)]
*  I voted in Miami-Dade County, a blue county, this past Friday, and I did it in my brother [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=141.72s)]
*  Christian's memory. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=145.96s)]
*  I voted for Donald J. Trump and J.D. Vance. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=146.96s)]
*  And I encourage everyone out there listening to do exactly the same. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Democrats know that Kamala Harris is underperforming Joe Biden's numbers when he was at his worst [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=154.0s)]
*  after that debate. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=159.44s)]
*  She's underperforming him with African Americans, Hispanic, working class whites, union members. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=160.68s)]
*  And I got to tell you, even at that polling place that I was at, I talked to a polling [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=166.32s)]
*  that was handling my ballot. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=169.76s)]
*  I said, have you seen a lot of folks come into this office and vote for Donald J. Trump? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=170.76s)]
*  And he said, yes, I am shocked by the number of African American young men, like myself, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=175.36s)]
*  he said, that are voting for Donald J. Trump. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=181.88s)]
*  And the Democrats see this bearing out in their data. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=184.48s)]
*  And they don't know what to do about it, Sean, because we have a realignment of the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=187.96s)]
*  Republican Party, and it is now the party of American First. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=191.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=195.0s)]
*  Real quick, Gianna, where could people see you have an ad running about crime in Illinois? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=196.32s)]
*  Where could they see that? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=200.4s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShaZn_VrJHc&t=201.4s)]
