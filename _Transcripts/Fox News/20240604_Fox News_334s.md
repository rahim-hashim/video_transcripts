# Jim Jordan: Merrick Garland wonâ€™t answer this
**Fox News:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA)
*  Finally, Republicans at their best. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=0.0s)]
*  And despite the threat of being held in contempt, Garland again said his DOJ will not release [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=2.44s)]
*  audio of Biden's disastrous interview with the special counsel Robert Herr. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=8.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=13.94s)]
*  Look. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=14.94s)]
*  I have provided the committee with special counsel Herr's report, why the special counsel [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=15.94s)]
*  testified for more than five hours, and why we have gone beyond precedent to provide the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=21.18s)]
*  committee with the transcripts of the special counsel's interview with the president. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=26.5s)]
*  But we have made clear that we will not provide audio recordings from which the transcripts [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=32.1s)]
*  that you already have were created. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=37.82s)]
*  Release the tapes, Mr. Attorney General. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=42.54s)]
*  Let the American people hear and see them. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=45.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan is urging Congress to quote defund [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=48.1s)]
*  activities of Trump prosecutors. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=53.46s)]
*  Chairman Jordan joins us now with more. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  Wow, what a day. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=58.58s)]
*  Let's get your summation of all of what happened. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=60.38s)]
*  Well, first of all, there is no dispute about what Jack Smith did. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=63.58s)]
*  He altered the sequence of the documents he sees in that raid on Mar-a-Lago, which by [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=66.9s)]
*  the way violated every process and norm the Justice Department has when he did that a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=70.62s)]
*  year ago in August. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=74.8s)]
*  So there is no dispute about that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=75.86s)]
*  It's in the court filing, as we pointed out in the hearing today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=77.3s)]
*  Jack Smith said, yeah, the sequence has been changed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=80.22s)]
*  So that was a big takeaway. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=83.26s)]
*  And then the other one was we've asked for these communications. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=84.26s)]
*  Mayor Garza says, I don't know if the Justice Department has communicated with Fonny, Wilson, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=87.82s)]
*  Alvin Bragg. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=91.06s)]
*  We've asked for all those communications months ago, but he says he still doesn't know. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=92.06s)]
*  Give us the communications if they exist. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=96.18s)]
*  If they don't tell us, but he won't say, which leads anyone with common sense to believe [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=98.1s)]
*  there was communication going on. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=103.14s)]
*  For example, we know Nathan Wade came up from Georgia and had meetings with the White House, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=105.24s)]
*  the Justice Department in the January 6 committee, and we are going to get those communications. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=110.1s)]
*  So those are those in my mind were the two biggest takeaways. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  And then, of course, the last one was the third was this idea that he is not going to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=118.05999999999999s)]
*  give us the audio. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  I think they waived the privilege when they gave us everything else. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=122.97999999999999s)]
*  And we'll never forget, Sean, we've already seen the White House alter the transcript [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=125.5s)]
*  that the transcripts are different than what President Biden may say out when he's given [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=130.56s)]
*  a speech reading from the teleprompter. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  We have caught them making adjustments to that before. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=136.4s)]
*  So we want the audio tape because we want the best evidence to do our constitutional [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=139.22s)]
*  duty to do oversight. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=143.58s)]
*  The American people have a right to hear them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=146.28s)]
*  The American people have an election coming up. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  And if Joe Biden didn't know, you know, that he became vice president in 2009, was I still [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=151.22s)]
*  vice president in 2009, we need to hear that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=157.86s)]
*  The American people need to hear that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=162.56s)]
*  Garland is running cover for Joe Biden. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=165.66s)]
*  And that's what the weaponization of justice has now become, politicizing the Justice Department. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  That's what your committee has been and continues to investigate. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=175.94s)]
*  Were you happy with the answers you got today? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=179.42s)]
*  They were revealing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=182.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=184.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=185.3s)]
*  But also remember the context on the on this special counsel, her investigation of President [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=186.3s)]
*  Biden, page one of that report, special counsel, her says Joe Biden knowingly kept Joe Biden [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=190.38s)]
*  disclosed classified information. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=195.82s)]
*  Page 231, he told us why he did it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=197.98s)]
*  He said Joe Biden had strong motivations for ignoring classified procedures because he [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=200.33999999999997s)]
*  was writing a book, a book for which he got paid eight million dollars. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=204.54s)]
*  So we have motive. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=208.11999999999998s)]
*  We have the elements of the crime, but we're not going to charge him. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=209.22s)]
*  And yet the White House and the Justice Department say we're impartial, we're independent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=211.94s)]
*  It's not based on politics. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=216.1s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=217.38s)]
*  Then give us the best evidence. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=218.38s)]
*  And the best evidence is the audio tape so we can evaluate this in the context of Congress's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  duty in an impeachment inquiry to get all the evidence and evaluate that evidence. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=225.66s)]
*  That's why we're in the right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=230.54s)]
*  And that's why we held Merrick Garland in contempt. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=231.54s)]
*  So we have that issue. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=233.94s)]
*  And then what they're doing to President Trump through Jack Smith and through this communication [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=235.02s)]
*  with what Alvin Bragg did up in New York. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=239.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=241.94s)]
*  He wouldn't answer Gates's question about if he'll provide documents and communications [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=242.94s)]
*  with Bragg, Letitia James, Fannie Willis's office. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=246.94s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  You got to be kidding me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  You know, he wouldn't answer your question on Jack Smith's tampering with evidence. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=252.14s)]
*  Jack Smith put that in the court filing in the Florida document case. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  He said it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=261.53999999999996s)]
*  You didn't make that up out of nowhere. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  I read from the court filing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=263.53999999999996s)]
*  I read from the filing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  And the idea that the third highest ranking official in the DOJ goes to prosecute Trump [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=265.53999999999996s)]
*  in New York, we don't think there's coordination there of any kind, something that he needs [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=276.14s)]
*  to answer for. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=281.14s)]
*  That's why we got legislation which says no federal money can go to Fannie Willis. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=283.46s)]
*  No federal money can go to any of these rogue state prosecutors like Bragg and Willis who [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=287.26s)]
*  are going after using lawfare, going after their political opponents and any special [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=291.42s)]
*  counsel that is out there who wasn't approved by the Senate should be defunded as well. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=296.5s)]
*  That's our legislation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=301.18s)]
*  In addition, we've also got you should be able to move the venue to federal court, which [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=302.18s)]
*  was legislation we passed months ago out of the committee. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  It would not help this country if this guy is reelected in 153 days. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=310.85999999999996s)]
*  Really, it's bad. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  Jim Jordan, keep up the good work. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=317.85999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=319.85999999999996s)]
*  Great day for Judiciary, I'll tell you that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3SfciappOA&t=320.85999999999996s)]
