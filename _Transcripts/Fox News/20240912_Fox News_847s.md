# Sean Hannity: Kamala Harris is planning to raise taxes on all of you
**Fox News:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, it is no secret that one candidate—yes, Vice President Kamala Harris—is planning [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=1.28s)]
*  to raise taxes on all of you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=6.84s)]
*  But just moments ago, Donald Trump unveiled a new plan to cut taxes for the hardest-working [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=8.9s)]
*  Americans who don't put—you know, don't clock out at 5 o'clock. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=14.64s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=19.6s)]
*  I haven't worked an eight-hour day in most of my life. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=20.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=23.84s)]
*  I'm also announcing that as part of our additional tax cuts, we will end all taxes on overtime. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=25.2s)]
*  You know what that means? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=33.92s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=34.92s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=35.92s)]
*  Well, a bunch more on President Trump's economic vision. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=36.92s)]
*  That's coming up tonight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=44.68s)]
*  But first, we are only 54 days away from the 2024 election. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=45.68s)]
*  Pennsylvania voting, that begins in, oh, just a mere five days. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  In Alabama, the first ballots are officially in the mail. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=54.8s)]
*  More than a dozen states, including swing states like Wisconsin, they are scheduled [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=57.8s)]
*  to send out ballots later this month. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=61.96s)]
*  We are in the home stretch of a race that will impact the course of our country for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  decades to come. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=69.38s)]
*  It is an inflection point for this country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=70.38s)]
*  And as most of you know, Donald Trump isn't just facing off against Kamala Harris. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  He is running against what are vicious, powerful institutions and a political machine that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=76.88s)]
*  spans the Democratic Party. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=84.52s)]
*  They're running against the state-run corrupt Pravda media mob, a powerful deep state with [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  bureaucrats in every department of your federal government, a weaponized Department of Justice. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  Oh, and to add insult to injury, he's running against Big Tech, too. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  They're all putting cinder blocks on the scale of an election. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=102.0s)]
*  Now, the same political machine that booted Joe Biden from the ballot after he won millions [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=104.92s)]
*  of votes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=109.24s)]
*  Well, that same political machine has been trying to destroy Donald Trump for the better [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  part of an entire decade. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=115.16s)]
*  And yet, the polls tonight are close. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=117.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is holding on to a 60 percent edge in today's forecast from statistician [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  Nate Silver. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  The latest insider advantage poll post-debate has Donald Trump up by one in Michigan with [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=127.36s)]
*  a boost from African-American voters in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=132.72s)]
*  The race is very, very close. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=135.92s)]
*  Tied. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=138.04s)]
*  The poll had Trump up by two recently. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=139.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, the lawfare against President Trump, that continues after all those years. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=141.4s)]
*  You know, one after another. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=147.56s)]
*  It's like dominoes falling. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=148.56s)]
*  They all fall apart. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=149.88s)]
*  If Democrats and Biden's DOJ had their way, Trump would be in jail right now. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=151.44s)]
*  But they're not getting their way. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=156.88s)]
*  You know, thankfully, we have checks and balances in our court system. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  But today, two more criminal counts against Donald Trump, this in the Fulton County case [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=161.6s)]
*  in Georgia, were dismissed by a Fulton County judge. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=167.32s)]
*  So far, five of the original 13 charges by Fonny Willis have been dismissed before trial [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=171.0s)]
*  as the entire case remains in jeopardy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  In fact, every case against Trump is falling apart. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=178.8s)]
*  And as Politico points out, well, Democrats underestimate Trump at their own peril. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=183.4s)]
*  His opponent, Kamala Harris, is running the most dishonest, least authentic campaign in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=188.8s)]
*  human history. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=194.46s)]
*  In the debate, she lied and lied repeatedly, dozens of times, about a national sales tax [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  that Trump has never supported and doesn't support, about a—he'll sign a nationwide [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=202.76s)]
*  abortion ban that Donald Trump has never supported, will never support, a ban on IVF, what he [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  has actually been in favor of IVF, and that nobody, by the way, wants, and, quote, Donald [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=215.92s)]
*  Trump's Project 2025 that Trump had absolutely nothing to do with, hasn't read, by the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=223.16s)]
*  way, for the record, nor have I. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=227.84s)]
*  She also lied and brought up—you know, brought out the hits. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=229.76s)]
*  Let's bring up Charlottesville. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=232.68s)]
*  She lied about Trump's role in January 6, lied about fracking, lied about oil, lied [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=234.16s)]
*  about her support for the Minnesota bail fund, lied about Trump's bloodbath comments on [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=239.84s)]
*  the economy, lied about Trump's position on NATO, lied about zero troops serving in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=244.32s)]
*  combat zones, lied about Trump's role in the Biden-Harris administration and their [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=249.12s)]
*  disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=253.76s)]
*  How do you blame Donald Trump for that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=256.08s)]
*  Lied about gun confiscation? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=258.32s)]
*  She said it repeatedly. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=260.24s)]
*  Lied about her support for defunding the police? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=261.92s)]
*  She said that, too. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=264.52s)]
*  She even lied about being a middle-class kid. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=265.82s)]
*  In reality, she grew up in one of the most prestigious neighborhoods in Montreal, two [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  very affluent parents. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=274.52s)]
*  She lied about violent crime, along with her two supporters at the debate that were masquerading [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=277.0s)]
*  as journalists, you know, their liberal, radical, left, Democratic talk show hosts. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=283.76s)]
*  And they said that violent crime was down. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=289.4s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=291.88s)]
*  By the way, ABC Disney, Bob Iger, take note, because your network, run by Disney, got it [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=293.18s)]
*  wrong. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=300.64s)]
*  Look at the data from the DOJ. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=301.64s)]
*  Violent crime is up 37 percent under the Harris-Biden administration. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=303.92s)]
*  Rape in America is up 42 percent. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  Robbery is up 63 percent. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=311.92s)]
*  Assault is up a whopping 34 percent. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  And stranger violence up 61 percent. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=317.32s)]
*  Violent crime with a weapon, that's up 63 percent. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=319.92s)]
*  Motor vehicle theft up a whopping 42 percent. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  And the list goes on. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=326.12s)]
*  But the lies don't stop there. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=327.48s)]
*  Kamala lied today, claiming that Donald Trump wants to cut Medicare, a complete lie in falsehood. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=330.04s)]
*  But Kamala's most egregious lies, frankly, are about herself. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=336.6s)]
*  We have her in her own words on record. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=340.88s)]
*  By the way, it's all on the Kamala files at Hannity.com. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=344.0s)]
*  We have the Walls files, too, if you're interested in her VP selection, a radical [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=347.56s)]
*  Bernie Sanders governor. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=352.16s)]
*  Anyway, for decades she was to the left of Bernie Sanders, eagerly supporting. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  She was a co-sponsor of the Marxist legislation, the $93 trillion Green New Deal, which would [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=359.2s)]
*  eliminate capitalism, the greatest source of wealth creation ever designed by man, if [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=367.54s)]
*  ever implemented. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  And she co-sponsored with Bernie, you know, government health care for all, and by the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=375.48s)]
*  way, free for illegal immigrants. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=381.16s)]
*  She promoted open borders, taxpayer-funded housing, health care, education, and even—now, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=383.16s)]
*  slow down on this—for illegal immigrants and for convicted felons. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=389.92s)]
*  Do you really want your money to go to sex change operations for people that don't [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=396.04s)]
*  respect our laws, our sovereignty, our borders, or people convicted of crimes? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=401.36s)]
*  Because Kamala Harris has supported it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=406.64000000000004s)]
*  And this was when she was running for president. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=410.6s)]
*  She wanted to defund the police, dismantle, reimagine them, defund ICE, reimagine ICE, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=413.06s)]
*  put violent criminals back on the street with zero bail, supported that Minnesota bail [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  fund four days after burning down the Minneapolis police precinct and releasing rioters and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=423.66s)]
*  insurrectionists, in case you're paying attention in Washington tonight, in the summer of 2020. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=429.66s)]
*  And of course, she was a big supporter of federal gun confiscation, mandatory. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=435.58s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=439.46s)]
*  But the very moment she was elevated to a candidate, her positions all changed overnight. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=441.14s)]
*  Or at least, that's what she wants you to believe. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=446.53999999999996s)]
*  How about you decide? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=449.74s)]
*  Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=450.74s)]
*  We're not taking anybody's guns away, so stop with the continuous lying about this [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=453.18s)]
*  stuff. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=457.06s)]
*  I support buybacks. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=458.06s)]
*  How mandatory is your gun buyback program? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=460.46s)]
*  It's mandatory. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=462.78s)]
*  I will not ban fracking. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=463.78s)]
*  I have not banned fracking as vice president of the United States. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=465.38s)]
*  I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=468.82s)]
*  fracking. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=474.90000000000003s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=476.22s)]
*  adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=481.3s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=485.58000000000004s)]
*  I absolutely support, and over the last four years as vice president, private healthcare [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=487.58000000000004s)]
*  options. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=492.5s)]
*  You support the Medicare for All bill, I think, initially co-sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=493.5s)]
*  I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=497.86s)]
*  So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=502.98s)]
*  Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=506.86s)]
*  And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=511.5s)]
*  them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=515.54s)]
*  Who of us has not had that situation where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=519.66s)]
*  says, well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=523.5s)]
*  Let's eliminate all of that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=528.34s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=529.34s)]
*  The United States Congress, including some of the most conservative members of the United [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=530.34s)]
*  States Senate, came up with a border security bill, which I supported. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=533.22s)]
*  And that bill would have put 1,500 more border agents on the border to help those folks who [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=539.26s)]
*  are working there right now over time trying to do their job. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=544.42s)]
*  And I think there's no question that we've got to critically reexamine ICE and its role [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=548.14s)]
*  and the way that it is being administered and the work it is doing. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=552.94s)]
*  And we need to probably think about starting from scratch. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=556.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=558.34s)]
*  Make no mistake, Kamala didn't suddenly change all of her views and her entire political [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=559.34s)]
*  philosophy overnight. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=564.54s)]
*  She's lying. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=565.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=567.3000000000001s)]
*  To get elected, to get power. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=568.3000000000001s)]
*  And then she will revert to form, no doubt about it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=570.28s)]
*  At the debate, she couldn't give a single straight answer, ducking and dodging and weaving [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=572.84s)]
*  every question with the help of two very corrupt, biased ABC Disney moderators. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=577.0600000000001s)]
*  So, woke and Democratic-supporting Disney is clearly more concerned in electing Kamala [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=583.0200000000001s)]
*  than conservatives attending their theme parks or buying any of their products. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=589.3000000000001s)]
*  Is it any wonder Disney's stock? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=594.6s)]
*  It's in the tank, if you haven't been looking. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=597.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's lost a lot of value. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=599.3800000000001s)]
*  According to the L.A. Times, David Muir and Lindsay Davis studied hours of Trump rallies [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  in order to rebut him in real time. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=607.1400000000001s)]
*  Davis telling The Times, quote, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=609.66s)]
*  The attempt to correct the candidates was in response to the June 27 CNN debate between [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=611.74s)]
*  Trump and President Biden, whose poor performance led to his exit from the race. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=617.66s)]
*  They couldn't let that happen to Kamala. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=622.66s)]
*  Well, that's a nice admission, but it does say a lot, because they never once corrected [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=625.66s)]
*  Kamala. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=630.54s)]
*  And we've added up over 25 lies that she told, as did the Federalists and many other [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=631.54s)]
*  fact-checkers. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=635.74s)]
*  Despite all of this assistance from ABC Disney, the woke network, the talk network of liberal [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=637.0999999999999s)]
*  radical leftist Democratic talk show hosts, even fake Jake, our old friend over at Fake [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=643.7399999999999s)]
*  News CNN, he was even less than impressed with Kamala's performance. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=649.26s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=653.14s)]
*  Despite the economy being the number one issue facing the country, the sitting vice president [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=654.5799999999999s)]
*  generally reverted to talking points about a few of her policy proposals. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=659.5799999999999s)]
*  Even Harris allies today are saying that she needs to talk more about what she will do [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=664.14s)]
*  for Americans if elected. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=668.98s)]
*  On the border, another vulnerable issue for Harris, she also dodged. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=671.3000000000001s)]
*  Would you have done anything differently from President Biden on this? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=677.26s)]
*  So I'm the only person on this stage who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=680.5400000000001s)]
*  for the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=685.7s)]
*  OK, that wasn't the question. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=689.86s)]
*  I may have to stop calling him fake Jake. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=694.14s)]
*  I mean, she was like a robot. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=696.26s)]
*  I don't care what you ask. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=698.14s)]
*  I'll go right to my rehearsed lines. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=699.14s)]
*  Keep in mind, Tuesday's debate was only the second time in the entire campaign that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=701.1800000000001s)]
*  Kamala said more than two or three sentences without a teleprompter. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=706.02s)]
*  There has been just one joint interview, a whopping 16 minutes and 29 seconds of speaking, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=709.82s)]
*  and she did bring her emotional support running mate, and no pressers, no town halls, zero [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=716.3000000000001s)]
*  solo interviews, even even photographers in the press are reportedly complaining about [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=722.98s)]
*  a, quote, unprecedented reduction in access to the news media. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=728.6999999999999s)]
*  One top Democrat is hoping it stays that way, urging Harris to stay away. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=732.62s)]
*  Whatever you do, stay away from her adoring fans in the state run media mob. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=737.5s)]
*  Maybe not bad advice if you don't care about the American people and them being informed. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=743.54s)]
*  I think that just to say have one on one discussions with people in the media will not necessarily [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=750.98s)]
*  connect with the voters. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=759.94s)]
*  I want to see her connecting with voters, responding to their dreams and their aspirations. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=762.34s)]
*  Because you know, if you go on these one on ones, sometimes you build on into a question [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=769.74s)]
*  until there's a word that's uttered that can be used in a negative way. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=776.3s)]
*  In other words, Democratic advice, hide, Kamala hide. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=784.0999999999999s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, he said the quiet part out loud. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=788.4599999999999s)]
*  She's not changing her positions. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=791.4599999999999s)]
*  She's only being pragmatic to win an election. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=793.3s)]
*  He's not lying here. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=796.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=797.5s)]
*  You have described Vice President Kamala Harris as a progressive. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=798.5s)]
*  She has previously supported Medicare for all. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=802.74s)]
*  Now she does not. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=805.54s)]
*  She's previously supported a ban on fracking. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=807.1s)]
*  Now she does not. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=809.3s)]
*  These Senator are ideas that you have campaigned on. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=811.38s)]
*  Do you think that she is abandoning her progressive ideals? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=814.82s)]
*  No, I don't think she's abandoning her ideals. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=818.74s)]
*  I think she's trying to be pragmatic and doing what she thinks is right in order to win the election. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=823.34s)]
*  I'll say what I need to say just to win the election. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=830.14s)]
*  If it means lying, sure. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnojBtWHS8&t=832.74s)]
