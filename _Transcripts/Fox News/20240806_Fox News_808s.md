# JD Vance: This is a shameful moment for Kamala Harris
**Fox News:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE)
*  We're only 91 days away from Election Day, 42 days away from early voting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=0.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, well, they may be the most liberal ticket in history, in the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=5.9s)]
*  history of this country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=11.58s)]
*  They are radical, they are extreme, and if their policies were ever implemented, I think [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=13.18s)]
*  they'd be downright dangerous. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=17.86s)]
*  Anyway, here with his thoughts, Republican vice presidential nominee, Senator J.D. Vance. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=19.02s)]
*  Senator, good to see you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=23.66s)]
*  I saw you in Pennsylvania today. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  And unlike Kamala Harris, you were actually willing to talk to the press. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=26.62s)]
*  I got to give you props for that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=29.96s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Sean. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=34.0s)]
*  What I think is if you want to be the people's vice president or president, you actually [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=34.92s)]
*  ought to go before the journalists, even the hostile ones, and actually answer some questions. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=39.0s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't nearly every single day. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=43.04s)]
*  Of course, I'm willing to do it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=45.2s)]
*  And it really should shame the media, Sean, that Kamala Harris, who is the most liberal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  presidential candidate that we've ever had in this country, refuses to answer basic [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=51.6s)]
*  questions about a record. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=55.68000000000001s)]
*  Why did she support a ban on fracking? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=56.92s)]
*  Why did she support defunding the police? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=58.7s)]
*  Why does she want to ship American manufacturing jobs to China? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=60.34s)]
*  Why is she the border czar at a time of historic border crisis? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=63.62s)]
*  The fact that the media is letting her coast without answering a single question is really [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=67.66s)]
*  disgraceful. And the fact that Kamala Harris is willing to have this thing handed to her [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=72.5s)]
*  without actually persuading the American voters is really scandalous and shows she should [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=76.3s)]
*  never be president. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  The media has no shame. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=82.18s)]
*  I declared in 2007 and 2008 that journalism is dead. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  You talked about Tim Walz and his record as a joke and that he also Kamala Harris bent [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  the knee to the pro Hamas wing of her party. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=95.36s)]
*  Explain. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=98.92s)]
*  Well, we know that the people who were considered were Josh Shapiro, Mark Kelly and this guy, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=102.08s)]
*  Tim Walz. And we know that Josh Shapiro in particular was attacked mercilessly from the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=107.24s)]
*  far left for being Jewish, for not being anti-Israel enough. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=112.42s)]
*  And of course, he ran away from his own positions. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=116.66000000000001s)]
*  But the fact that you're letting anti-Semites within the Democrat Party drive so much of the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  conversation and so much of the decision making for Kamala Harris is a really worrying sign, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=123.58000000000001s)]
*  Sean. You have to ask yourself, who does Kamala Harris answer to? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=128.78s)]
*  Does she answer to the American people or does she answer to the far left of her own [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=132.06s)]
*  party? On issue after issue from opening the border to supporting higher grocery prices on [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  American, she has bent the knee to the far left of the party. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=141.0s)]
*  And this decision, selecting Tim Walz is another sign that she doesn't care what the American [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=144.2s)]
*  people think. She is only in this to obey the far left radicals within her own party. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=149.76s)]
*  It's a really shameful moment for Kamala Harris. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Tim Walz has all of these things we can point to. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=158.32s)]
*  He's a really far left candidate. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=160.83999999999997s)]
*  He's a really far left governor. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=162.48s)]
*  But the fact that Kamala Harris selected him, I think shows really, really poor judgment and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=163.92s)]
*  that she doesn't have what it takes to be president of the United States. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=169.34s)]
*  I think it shows, too, that this is who she is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=172.7s)]
*  I mean, I really have to wonder if they even bothered to vet her. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=175.78s)]
*  I want to go a little deeper. I want to go to the comments because I think they were pretty [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=180.22s)]
*  profound. And that's from Van Jones, who said, but you have anti-Semitism that has gotten [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=184.22s)]
*  marbled into this party. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=190.82s)]
*  You can be for the Palestinians without being an anti-Jewish bigot. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=192.9s)]
*  But there are anti-Jewish bigots out there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=197.12s)]
*  He's talking about his own party, the Democratic Party. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=199.72s)]
*  And there's this quiet. There has to be. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=202.48s)]
*  How much of what just happened is caving into some of the darker parts of the party? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  He's talking about the Democratic Party. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=212.28s)]
*  And it has become, you know, we saw what happened. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=215.68s)]
*  I think one of the worst failures of the Biden and Harris administration is when Iran was [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=218.84s)]
*  attacking Israel. We're still, you know, we're the world is on edge expecting another [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=224.68s)]
*  attack from Iran on Israel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=230.82s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if Hamas is Bola weighed in as well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=232.5s)]
*  And what their answer was is, well, we'll defend you, but you're on your own if you want [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=237.16s)]
*  to retaliate. That, to me, is surrendering in the war against radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=242.18s)]
*  But Kamala Harris, we now know, said that we should be courageous and never use that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=247.58s)]
*  term. Well, then who attacked us on 9-11? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=252.52s)]
*  You served in Iraq. Who attacked us on October, who attacked Israel on October 7th? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=255.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's exactly right, Sean. And look, you don't have to judge my words. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=263.16s)]
*  Just just actually pay attention to what the Democrats said about Josh Shapiro. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=266.04s)]
*  Numerous grassroots activists, numerous leaders within the Democrat Party said you shouldn't [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=270.52s)]
*  choose this guy because he's Jewish. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=274.84s)]
*  I take them at their word. That's face value. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=277.04s)]
*  And that is ridiculous for any American political party. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=279.38s)]
*  Obviously, you know, I don't care ultimately who Kamala Harris selects, but I don't want [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=282.86s)]
*  the vice presidential nomination of any party being determined by whether you have the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=287.46s)]
*  right ethnic background. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=291.86s)]
*  It's profoundly anti-American. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=293.09999999999997s)]
*  And to your point, Sean, it goes to the heart of their terrible policy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=295.34s)]
*  These are guys who invited weakness. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=299.06s)]
*  These are guys who invited the attack on Israel. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=301.3s)]
*  These are people who invited every single anti-American despot all over the world to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=303.58s)]
*  get richer and more powerful because of their policies. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=308.86s)]
*  And now that our allies and ourselves are under threat, they're doing absolutely nothing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  about it. Here, we talked about the media not asking Kamala Harris questions, Sean. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=316.68s)]
*  Here's a question I'd like to ask Kamala Harris. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=321.12s)]
*  If Joe Biden can't do the job and clearly he can't, who's actually in charge of the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=323.44s)]
*  United States government right now? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  Is it you? And if you're not doing something, why not? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=329.04s)]
*  She sponsored Medicare for All bill that would eliminate all private health care, as [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=333.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris did. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=337.38s)]
*  She sponsored the Green New Deal in the U.S. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=339.26s)]
*  Senate, said she would use the filibuster to pass the Green New Deal. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  No restrictions at all on abortion. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=345.98s)]
*  And Wall said one person's socialism is another person's neighborliness. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=348.1s)]
*  And Kamala wants either a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  They want to raise taxes on income corporations. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=359.42s)]
*  They want to raise it on small business. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=361.94s)]
*  They want to even real, want it on unrealized capital gains. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=363.92s)]
*  What would that do to the economy, which is now teetering also? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, it would destroy the innovation economy, Sean, because so much of the actual [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=373.08000000000004s)]
*  technological innovation in our economy is based in unrealized gains. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  But more importantly, these guys want to destroy the American energy sector, which [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=381.32000000000005s)]
*  would make us more reliant on China, China for the goods that we need. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  They want to open the American southern border. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=389.12s)]
*  And like you said, not only does she want Medicare for all, she doesn't even care if [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=391.58s)]
*  you're a citizen, Sean. This is Kamala Harris has supported giving Medicare and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=395.5s)]
*  Social Security benefits to illegal aliens. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=399.54s)]
*  So the question for the American people is, do you want to bankrupt Social Security [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  and Medicare by giving it to illegal aliens? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=406.02s)]
*  Because if so, Kamala Harris is your person. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=408.02s)]
*  If you want to preserve Social Security so that we don't throw a generation of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=410.3s)]
*  elderly Americans into poverty, then Donald Trump is your candidate. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=413.98s)]
*  And it's very simple issue after issue. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=416.98s)]
*  Do you want an open border? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=419.38s)]
*  If no, Donald Trump is your guy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=420.6s)]
*  Do you want American government to protect American citizens? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=422.76s)]
*  If you do, then clearly you got to back Donald Trump. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=426.04s)]
*  Do you want a tax policy that promotes American workers and promotes building [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=428.88s)]
*  things in the United States of America? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=433.16s)]
*  If so, you've got to vote for Donald Trump, Sean. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=435.04s)]
*  It's really not complicated. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=436.92s)]
*  On policy after policy, Kamala Harris is far to the left of even Joe Biden. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=438.6s)]
*  She's governed that way, and she would do even worse if the American people give her [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=443.72s)]
*  promotion. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=447.48s)]
*  So both support the idea that it shouldn't be criminal to enter our country illegally. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=449.06s)]
*  They both support sanctuary cities and states. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=453.82s)]
*  They both support taxpayer dollars being used to support the cost of education, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  health care and housing for illegal immigrants. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=463.14s)]
*  And here's the problem, JD. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=466.94s)]
*  We've got 11 million unvetted Biden-Harris illegal immigrants. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=468.82s)]
*  They're coming from a lot of countries that are our top geopolitical foes, but also [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=473.02s)]
*  we're catching all these people, as the congressional report pointed out this week, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=477.62s)]
*  that have terror ties. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=481.76s)]
*  Ninety nine of them they released into the country. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=484.24s)]
*  That tells me that's a real clear present danger to our country right now, that it's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=486.96s)]
*  a matter of when, not if, we're going to get hit again. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=491.92s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  I do, unfortunately, Sean. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=497.88s)]
*  I mean, look, Borders of our Kamala Harris has handwritten an invitation to every [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=499.16s)]
*  illegal alien and every terrorist across the world coming through our southern [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=503.16s)]
*  border. It's wide open. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=506.58s)]
*  They stopped deportations on day one. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=507.78000000000003s)]
*  They tried to give amnesty to millions of people on day one. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=510.06s)]
*  Kamala Harris, like you said, wants to decriminalize illegal aliens and then give them [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=513.02s)]
*  health care at taxpayer expense once they actually get here. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=517.06s)]
*  That invites millions of people into our country who shouldn't be here, Sean. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=520.74s)]
*  And you asked about Iran earlier. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=524.1s)]
*  One of the things that reduces our leverage to respond to Iran is that we know there [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=525.98s)]
*  are Iranian-backed terrorists who are in this country right now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=531.26s)]
*  There's no way that they couldn't be here with over 10 million people coming in in [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=534.24s)]
*  just the last three years. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris has made us weaker because she has invited millions of illegal aliens [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=540.52s)]
*  into our country to break our laws and take advantage of taxpayer benefits. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=545.24s)]
*  One final point on this, Sean, when I talk to Americans, one of the biggest concerns [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=549.72s)]
*  I hear is why our housing costs so high. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=554.24s)]
*  I'll give you two reasons, Sean. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=556.6s)]
*  Number one, there are 20 million illegal aliens here who shouldn't be here who are [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=557.84s)]
*  competing with Americans for scarce homes. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=561.88s)]
*  Number two, Kamala Harris has supported higher interest rates, which makes mortgages [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=564.06s)]
*  totally unaffordable for normal people. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=569.3s)]
*  So these policies make ordinary Americans suffer. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=571.46s)]
*  Of course, we haven't even talked about the fentanyl crisis. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=575.26s)]
*  On issue after issue, she's putting the interests of illegal aliens above American [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=577.9399999999999s)]
*  citizens. We've got to stop Kamala Harris, Sean. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=581.86s)]
*  And the only way to do that is to support Donald Trump at the ballot box. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=584.46s)]
*  You know, Kamala said it's the cost of democracy, the higher cost of energy, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=588.18s)]
*  because of their radical energy policies. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=593.18s)]
*  Both are against fracking and drilling, et cetera. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=595.88s)]
*  And these mandates that they're putting out regarding quote climate change [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=599.28s)]
*  initiatives, that to me would be America unilaterally, economically disarming and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=603.8399999999999s)]
*  literally will be run over by the rest of the world because they're not going to put [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=612.68s)]
*  the same restrictions on their economies. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=616.88s)]
*  It's exactly right, Sean, in the name of clean energy. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=618.96s)]
*  They want us to buy energy from tin pot dictators all over the world. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=623.62s)]
*  But of course, those dictators have much dirtier economies than the United States of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=627.6s)]
*  America. If you care about the environment, but also if you care about American jobs and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=631.84s)]
*  American national security, you want us to develop American energy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=636.1800000000001s)]
*  You want us, as Trump says, to drill baby drill and become energy dominant again. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=639.82s)]
*  There are so many reasons to reject their energy policy, Sean. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=644.7s)]
*  And another one is that you cannot manufacture anything in the United States of America [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=648.2s)]
*  without low cost power. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=653.08s)]
*  When Kamala Harris says she wants to ban fracking, what she's really saying is that she [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=654.64s)]
*  wants to ban manufacturing in Pennsylvania and Michigan because you're not going to be able [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=658.84s)]
*  to make anything in America if China and Russia control all the energy assets. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=662.72s)]
*  It's totally insane that we've gotten to a place as a country where Kamala Harris can [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=666.84s)]
*  call openly for eliminating America's energy sector and destroying the American [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=672.9200000000001s)]
*  manufacturing economy. But that's where we are, Sean. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=677.64s)]
*  And of course, the American people are not going to vote for this so long as they know [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=680.58s)]
*  how radical she is. And this is why the media needs to do its job. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=684.62s)]
*  I know they're liberal, Sean. I know they're biased. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=688.54s)]
*  I know a lot of them are, frankly, DNC propagandists, but the media has to ask Kamala [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=690.74s)]
*  Harris questions. Sixteen days, Sean, since she sat for a real media interview. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=696.46s)]
*  Are we going to get to the end of the election without anybody asking her questions? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=701.18s)]
*  If so, it's disgraceful. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=704.8199999999999s)]
*  It is exactly the same strategy that Joe used in 2020. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=707.16s)]
*  It's the hide in the basement strategy. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=710.8s)]
*  Exactly right. Let me ask you a last question. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=712.8s)]
*  You know, there was a lot made out of January 6th and we learned a lot more. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=715.04s)]
*  We learned that they never, for example, that they had actionable intelligence leading up [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=719.88s)]
*  to that. We learned there were five people in the Oval Office days before January 6th. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=725.4799999999999s)]
*  I interviewed four of the five and that all are on record saying that Donald Trump wanted [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=729.68s)]
*  to call up the guard in writing. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=734.9399999999999s)]
*  The Muriel Bowser, the mayor of D.C., said no. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=736.38s)]
*  I don't want to get back into that. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=740.38s)]
*  How is it there was no attention paid to the fact that there were five hundred and seventy [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=742.02s)]
*  four riots, as I mentioned, dozens of dead Americans, billions in property damage, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=746.54s)]
*  thousands of injured cops. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=751.54s)]
*  Where's Liz Cheney when you need her? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=753.78s)]
*  Because that sounds like insurrection. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=756.74s)]
*  Good question, Sean. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=757.9799999999999s)]
*  Sounds like insurrection to me, too. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=759.32s)]
*  And Governor Walt actually promoted the Black Lives Matter rioters who set Minneapolis on [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=762.32s)]
*  fire, destroyed a lot of black businesses, destroyed a lot of wealth in these historically [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=768.16s)]
*  black neighborhoods. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=772.84s)]
*  And it really caused the poverty to skyrocket in Minneapolis. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=774.12s)]
*  The fact that he was supporting the rioters burning down Minneapolis and then Kamala Harris [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=778.0s)]
*  was trying to bail them out of prison suggests they're the wrong team for this country. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=782.52s)]
*  We don't want that approach taken nationwide. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=786.16s)]
*  All right, Senator Vance, we appreciate your time tonight. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=789.28s)]
*  I know you've had a busy day, you've been out traveling. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=791.48s)]
*  I know you'll be on the road pretty much every day. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=793.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6otuPB0RJE&t=795.24s)]
