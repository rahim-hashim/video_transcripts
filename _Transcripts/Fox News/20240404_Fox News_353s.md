# Hannity exposes RFK, Jr’s ‘radical positions’
**Fox News:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA)
*  And welcome to Hannity. New York City Mayor Eric Adams once promised a sanctuary for all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=0.0s)]
*  illegal immigrants. Well, now he's actually blaming Texas for Joe Biden's border crisis [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=6.08s)]
*  and is inviting Governor Abbott to spend the night in an illegal immigrant shelter. Why [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=12.36s)]
*  don't you invite Joe Biden to do it? I'd even go and hang out with him. That's all [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=18.48s)]
*  coming up. Well, Greg, Governor Abbott's reaction tonight. Plus, we will detail the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=23.62s)]
*  very latest brazen crimes carried out by some of these so-called asylum seekers. We'll [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=27.92s)]
*  also introduce you to a new serious threat posed by the border crisis. Tuberculosis and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=33.88s)]
*  measles are now spreading like wildfire at an illegal immigrant shelter in Chicago. Multiple [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=40.84s)]
*  shelters actually. But first, with just 200—take a look at that number. 214 days until Election [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=48.38s)]
*  Day. It is an inflection point for this country. James Carville probably said it best. Biden's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=56.4s)]
*  poll numbers are kind of like seeing Grandma naked. Not a good sight. And because Biden [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=62.6s)]
*  is not willing or able to work harder or pound the campaign trail or change course on some [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=68.24s)]
*  of his idiotic policy decisions, well, he's really left with only two options. One, he [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=74.2s)]
*  can follow his wife's lead and deny the existence of these polls. Two, he can hire new internal [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=80.44000000000001s)]
*  pollsters and fire the old guys, and hopefully the new people will give him more favorable [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  results. And tonight, it looks like he is going with option door number two. According [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=93.04s)]
*  to Politico, some brand-new pollsters are now joining the Biden team, but I'm not sure [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=99.38000000000001s)]
*  Joe's going to like the results. Not only does Biden struggle in a head-to-head matchup [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  with Donald Trump, but his numbers get even worse when you throw RFK Jr. into the mix, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=109.4s)]
*  or as Politico put it, quote, how Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could doom Joe Biden. Now, for [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=115.36s)]
*  millions of far-left Americans disillusioned with Biden's incompetence, well, Kennedy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=121.56s)]
*  would probably be an obvious choice. By the way, when I met him, we did a town hall with [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=126.4s)]
*  him. I actually liked him. A good guy? I think some conservatives think, well, he was really [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=130.44s)]
*  good on shutdowns and mandates and so on and so forth and vaccines. Yeah, he's conservative. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=136.0s)]
*  No. On top of—by the way, he has been treated horribly by the Democratic Party. It's the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=143.88s)]
*  Democratic Party that set up a war room to attack him in an unrelenting way. It's a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=149.24s)]
*  disgrace, by the way, an utter disgrace that Biden is not providing him and his family [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  secret service protection, knowing that his father and his uncle were assassinated. He [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=163.16s)]
*  deserves secret service protection, and all our politicians need to be safe. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=168.89999999999998s)]
*  However, on the issue of Kennedy, well, here's what he is. He is a devout radical environmentalist [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  who frequently was heaping praise on Bernie Sanders and his radical Green New Deal. In [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=180.6s)]
*  the past, he's called for a complete ban on fracking. He's applauded Obama's limits [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=186.76s)]
*  on oil exploration, tweeting, quote, hashtag, keep it in the ground. No, I say bring it [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=191.64s)]
*  out of the ground. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  Anyways, campaign website, RFK Junior, promises to, quote, protect wild lands from further [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  development by curbing and mining—by curbing mining and logging and oil drilling and suburban [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  sprawl, as he calls it. This will undoubtedly drive up the cost of everything, especially [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  housing, and that's not all. The Kennedy campaign also has a plan to dismantle the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=218.44s)]
*  police, quote, Kennedy will reorient police to serve, not occupy, black communities to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=223.24s)]
*  keep neighborhoods safe rather than harassing their residents. There's also a section on [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  Kennedy's website about student loan forgiveness. He plans to make, quote, student debt dischargeable [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=235.24s)]
*  in bankruptcy and cut interest rates on student loans to zero. Who wants to lend people money [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=242.72s)]
*  and not get interest? Anyway, naturally small business loans will continue to accrue interest. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=249.16s)]
*  Here's another proposal that, well, bleeding-heart liberals will find very tempting. Kennedy [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  wants to slash the U.S. military budget and use the money for socialized healthcare. RFK [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=260.6s)]
*  Junior's running mate, very wealthy attorney, compelling life story from Silicon Valley. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=267.6s)]
*  Her name is Nicole Shanahan, a devout far-left Democrat. Notably, by the way, Shanahan has [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=272.88s)]
*  spoken out against in vitro fertilization. But thanks to Shanahan, well, the Kennedy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=279.12s)]
*  campaign now has extremely deep pockets and will pose a serious challenge to Biden's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  government. If you are a left-wing voter, Kennedy frankly gives you all the nutty Biden, Bernie [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=290.8s)]
*  Sanders, Green New Deal, climate alarmist, religious cult policies, maybe without the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  corruption and sleaze and the chaos, and he definitely knows what day of the week it is. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=304.0s)]
*  Got to give him credit for that. Let's not forget, at just 70 years of age, RFK Junior [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=308.92s)]
*  is more than a decade younger than Joe Biden, and he's more with it. He also supports [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=314.48s)]
*  affirmative action. He cut ads for the likes of Al Gore. He supported Hillary Clinton. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=319.12s)]
*  He supported Obama. He has supported every Democratic presidential candidate there is. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=324.68s)]
*  So, for conservatives that maybe liked his position on COVID, okay, now take a look at [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=330.35999999999996s)]
*  the rest of the record. We're only giving you fact-based information here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrT7QzOfROA&t=337.36s)]
