# Greg Abbott says Biden is ‘missing in action once again’
**Fox News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w)
*  As we have been reporting all night, historic fires decimating parts of our nation's most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=0.0s)]
*  populous county tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=6.0s)]
*  And unlike the train derailment in East Palestine and the Hurricane Helene and, oh, people in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=8.08s)]
*  North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and elsewhere, Biden actually showed up for the disaster [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  in L.A. with Gavin Newsom, but only because he was already in L.A. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=19.64s)]
*  And his remarks did not exactly inspire any confidence at all whatsoever in his leadership [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=25.32s)]
*  ability. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=31.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=32.52s)]
*  It's astounding what's happening. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  I know my mom is a good dude, but my son lives out here in Newquay. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=34.52s)]
*  They got this notification yesterday that they were home and going to burn up the ground. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=35.52s)]
*  Today, the parents are maybe still standing, but not sure. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=36.52s)]
*  The good news is, I'm a great grandfather, as of today. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=37.52s)]
*  I'm a great grandfather, as of today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=38.52s)]
*  I'm a great grandfather, as of today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=39.52s)]
*  I'm a great grandfather, as of today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=40.52s)]
*  I'm a great grandfather, as of today. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm a great grandfather, as of today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm a great grandfather, as of today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm a great grandfather, as of today. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm a great grandfather, as of today. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm a great grandfather, as of today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  OK, thousands of people lost their homes, but you're a great grandfather. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=47.720000000000006s)]
*  Congrats, Joe. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, the president-elect, Donald Trump, he slammed Biden on Truth Social, saying, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  no water in the fire hydrants, no money in FEMA. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=65.16s)]
*  This is what Joe Biden is leaving me? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=69.2s)]
*  Thanks, Joe. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=71.68s)]
*  Here now, Texas Governor Greg Abbott. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=72.68s)]
*  Also, they're leaving wide open borders, Governor, and you've been dealing with that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=75.42s)]
*  now for four years. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=79.02s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=81.02s)]
*  And so this is being missing in action once again for Joe Biden. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=83.02s)]
*  Remember that Joe Biden has a habit of doing this at disaster sites. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=86.34s)]
*  Remember when he was at the Maui fires in Hawaii, talking about some rinky-dink fire [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=89.94s)]
*  that he had on his property? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=94.74s)]
*  He always tries to inject himself into the disaster that somebody else is dealing with, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  and to raise his great-grandchildren at a time when you see these homes burning down [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=101.02s)]
*  and lives being lost is just outrageous. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=105.74s)]
*  What is needed is exactly what President Trump delivers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=108.1s)]
*  What is needed is for Joe Biden to stop giving money to the Ukraine and start providing it [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=112.25999999999999s)]
*  to North Carolina, and in this case, California, and helping out our fellow Americans and securing [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=115.58s)]
*  our border instead of sacrificing America just for the well-being of some other countries [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  across the globe. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=125.44s)]
*  And when President Trump gets back into office, he's going to do what Joe Biden has failed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=126.78s)]
*  to do, and that is to secure the border. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=131.04s)]
*  The biggest disaster we have in the entire country is the more than 11 million illegal [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=134.08s)]
*  immigrants who cross our border, many of whom are criminals, allowed in by the Joe Biden [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=138.28s)]
*  administration, and when the deportations begin in about two weeks, there's going to be a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=142.72s)]
*  rapid change. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=147.64s)]
*  We're finally going to have a restoration of security on the United States border. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=148.64s)]
*  Terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel members, gang members, and we don't know how many, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=153.36s)]
*  and we don't know where they are. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=160.84s)]
*  How do we find them, Governor? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  So we root them out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  The reality is, it's very easy to track down those with a criminal record. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  The Biden administration is just failing to do so. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=171.36s)]
*  We know that Tom Homan, the border czar, working with President Trump, they're going to be [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=173.44s)]
*  able—they'll go through entire jail systems across the United States. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=176.96s)]
*  We in Texas have identified thousands of people in our jails who are ready for deportation, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=181.28s)]
*  and we'll be working with the Trump administration to get that done. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=187.56s)]
*  That said, one thing we can expect is that increased activity by dangerous gangs like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=190.88s)]
*  Trinidad and Ragua trying to cross our border. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=196.12s)]
*  This is going to take ongoing efforts by Texas as well as the Trump administration to make [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=198.48s)]
*  sure we arrest those criminals and prevent them from entering our country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=202.4s)]
*  Governor, you've been fighting this battle alone. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=207.4s)]
*  I have good news. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=210.68s)]
*  Help is on the way, and it can't get there soon enough. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2RWwCPS6w&t=212.08s)]
