# JD Vance: Republicans have a ‘good record’ to run on
**Fox News:** [July 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI)
*  His name is mentioned quite often as a finalist for a potential VP pick. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=0.0s)]
*  It really seems to be coming down to you, Doug Burgum, Marco Rubio, Tim Scott. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=7.12s)]
*  I got to imagine that's pretty overwhelming, Senator. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=13.96s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=18.44s)]
*  Well, Sean, it's an incredible honor to be considered with those guys. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=19.44s)]
*  I think Donald Trump has got a lot of talented people he could choose from. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  And the most important thing, of course, is just that we reelect him because that's what [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=27.8s)]
*  matters is redelivering peace and prosperity for the American people. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=30.68s)]
*  And I think all of us believe that Donald Trump can do that because he has done that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=34.2s)]
*  We have to remember, Sean, that the stakes in this election are so unusual and they're [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=38.56s)]
*  so obvious. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=42.32s)]
*  Never in my lifetime have we had an election where you have one guy who governed for four [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=43.92s)]
*  years successfully, one guy who governed for four years catastrophically, and whether it's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=48.28s)]
*  Joe Biden at the top of the ticket or Kamala Harris, who, of course, has covered for Biden's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=52.96s)]
*  cognitive decline and defended every policy from his disastrous border policy to his disastrous [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=58.08s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=63.16s)]
*  It really doesn't matter because the results speak for themselves. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=64.36s)]
*  Trump delivered peace and prosperity. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=68.4s)]
*  He delivered lower grocery prices and higher wages, and the Democrats have delivered exactly [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  the opposite. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=75.0s)]
*  That's a really good record for us to run on, and I think Republicans are going to benefit [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=76.0s)]
*  up and down the ballot from that record and from those results. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=80.4s)]
*  I keep pointing out the great cover-up and the great lie. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=84.56s)]
*  Prior to the election in 2020, I was showing videos of Joe Biden's cognitive decline. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=87.92s)]
*  And it's gotten worse, but it was very obvious before the 2020 election. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=94.8s)]
*  Nobody could ever tell me with a straight face that they didn't see that what we were [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  witnessing and playing every single night. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=106.28s)]
*  The fact that they all covered it up, the media mob covered it up, the Democrats covered [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  it up, the people around Biden covered it up, what's your reaction to that? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=114.44s)]
*  Oh, it's so shameful, Sean. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=118.64s)]
*  Just talk about Kamala Harris. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  This is a person who for four years has saddled the United States with a president who can't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  do the job, and she did it all for political power. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=128.56s)]
*  She knew that whether it was now or four years from now, she would be the person who stood [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=131.66s)]
*  to inherit the presidency. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=136.68s)]
*  Well, what about the American people? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=138.4s)]
*  What about having a president who doesn't invite Russia and other countries to be aggressive? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  What about having a president who doesn't invite Iran and Hamas to attack our allies? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=147.08s)]
*  What about having a president who can function in the job and talk to world leaders without [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=153.0s)]
*  embarrassing us and, God forbid, causing a nuclear war? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=157.52s)]
*  On every single issue, Kamala Harris actually is responsible for Joe Biden's disastrous [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  presidency because she's covered for it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=167.56s)]
*  And like every other Democrat in elected leadership in this country, Sean, they all have gone [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  on TV, on radio, on newspapers and said for years that Joe Biden can do the job and he's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  doing just fine. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=180.38s)]
*  Well, now we know they were lying and we should punish them for lying to our faces about it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=181.38s)]
*  Well, this election, the American people, they will they will render the final verdict. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=186.36s)]
*  And this is an inflection point for the country. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Senator, we appreciate you being with us, as always. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=194.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJZhZAzEUI&t=197.48s)]
