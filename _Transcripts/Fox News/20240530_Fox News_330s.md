# Trump lawyer: If we don't stop this RIGHT NOW we are done!
**Fox News:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0)
*  All right, here to react to today's verdict, former president—president Trump's legal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=0.0s)]
*  spokeswoman—well, not former. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=3.84s)]
*  I mean, she's president Trump's legal spokesperson, Alina Haber. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  She's been in the courtroom the whole time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=9.88s)]
*  You know, everybody I know around President Trump says he's completely stoic, did—saw [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  this coming. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=18.28s)]
*  I guess that was clear in his comments about Mother Teresa. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=19.28s)]
*  However, I'm sure it doesn't take the sting away. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=21.84s)]
*  Based on the actions of this judge, one has to wonder, you know, four days before the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=25.8s)]
*  RNC, is he going to release President Trump on his own recognizance pending appeal? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=30.84s)]
*  Is he going to declare he has to have home confinement, can't go to a debate, can't [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=38.74s)]
*  go to his own convention pending appeal? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Or will he want to send him to jail? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=48.84s)]
*  Nothing that judge decides will shock me. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=50.92s)]
*  No, it won't shock me. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=53.63999999999999s)]
*  Let's remember who this judge is. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=55.31999999999999s)]
*  Sean, let's be very clear, and I am so happy to be on this show on such an important day [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=57.16s)]
*  in American history, because if we don't stop this now, we are done. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=61.48s)]
*  And I don't mean now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean right now, as in yesterday. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  Judge Mershon today watched my client. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=70.56s)]
*  I watched him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=72.96s)]
*  I watched the jury say guilty 34 times. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=73.96s)]
*  And I watched him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=76.32s)]
*  And he looked at my client, and he covered his mouth. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=77.66s)]
*  And he covered his mouth probably because he was smiling. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=81.32s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=83.32s)]
*  This judge has Bannon, Weisselberg, and no shock to me, Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=84.76s)]
*  And he is a hundred percent a man that should have recused himself. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=91.76s)]
*  But our justice system is so broken right now, Sean. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=95.32s)]
*  And I want to also remind the American people of one thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=98.24s)]
*  I am a legal spokesperson. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  I am also an American. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=102.48s)]
*  And I will be voting for Trump not because of President Trump, who I obviously support, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  but because I support America, and so does he. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=109.34s)]
*  Our country is currently in a serious state. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=111.98s)]
*  And we cannot look at this as anything other than a serious state of affairs, where we [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=115.78s)]
*  have an issue, where people are using politics in the legal courtroom. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=120.5s)]
*  It cannot happen anymore. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=125.16s)]
*  I have seen it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=126.62s)]
*  I have been in court since October. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=127.62s)]
*  Trial after trial after trial for 15 years. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=130.7s)]
*  I have been practicing law. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=133.62s)]
*  I have never seen anything like this in my life. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=134.9s)]
*  And that judge intentionally wouldn't even allow, in pre-trial proceedings that the court [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=137.42s)]
*  will not report, they would not allow us to bring up that President Trump didn't even [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=142.82s)]
*  take deductions. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  He didn't do anything wrong. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  His CFO, him, the Trump Organization, the family, nothing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  But that evidence was kept away from the jury, and it is intentional. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  This is not America. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=157.61999999999998s)]
*  And I'm speaking to MSNBC viewers and CNN viewers, the Rachel Maddowes, the Caitlin [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=159.33999999999997s)]
*  Collins. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  It's time to come together, because this administration does not care about us. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=166.02s)]
*  They do not. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  They care about themselves. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=171.82000000000002s)]
*  They don't care either, because they got what they wanted politically. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=173.9s)]
*  And for them, it doesn't matter. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=177.62s)]
*  The ends justify the means. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=179.86s)]
*  I will say this, and I said this a number of days ago. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  I was on Fox & Friends and on this show I said it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  This is not going to impact the election, is my prediction, in 158 days. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=188.68s)]
*  I don't believe it is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=192.18s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=194.02s)]
*  Michael Cohen himself testified that he told many people that he did this on his own. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=195.5s)]
*  You know, at that point, stop right there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=201.38s)]
*  That should have ended whatever novel legal theory they're putting out. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=205.34s)]
*  And I said also, Donald Trump can't get a fair trial in New York City, and he didn't [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=208.98s)]
*  get a fair trial in New York City. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=214.86s)]
*  And by the way, I'll find the money, and I'd love to buy Mar-a-Lago for $18 million [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=217.14s)]
*  turn around and sell it for a billion, because that's New York City's legal system. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=222.38s)]
*  How sad and pathetic is this? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=227.42s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not about Trump, and I really want everyone to understand that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=229.66s)]
*  I am the lawyer. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=233.66s)]
*  I see the rulings. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=234.66s)]
*  I see the hearings. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=235.66s)]
*  It's before the trials start that they do this to us. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=236.66s)]
*  It's before we can go in. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=240.01999999999998s)]
*  It's so that his legal spokeswoman is gagged, so that his campaign is gagged, so that President [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=241.46s)]
*  Trump is gagged. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=245.98s)]
*  And I'm still gagged, and so is he. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=247.28s)]
*  And you know why? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=249.1s)]
*  Because they don't want us to speak the truth. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=251.1s)]
*  That's called censorship. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=252.1s)]
*  That is not our country. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=253.1s)]
*  We don't do that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=256.1s)]
*  Let Americans vote for who they want. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=257.1s)]
*  And you know what they don't want? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=259.1s)]
*  They don't want what is going on right now, I assure you, because when I walk in the streets [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=260.6s)]
*  in New York by myself, I am praised and loved. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=264.26s)]
*  And I will tell you, President Trump, what we saw today was people streaming up and down [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=268.1s)]
*  the streets, waiting to see him just to give him a thumbs up. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=272.96s)]
*  We drove down and down, and the numbers just don't lie. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=276.2s)]
*  Look at the polls. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=278.94s)]
*  Sean, we are in a serious state of affairs. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=279.94s)]
*  America is under siege in a different way than I ever thought was possible. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=282.7s)]
*  And I never thought it would be people with a law license that would be doing it, judges [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=285.8s)]
*  that would be doing it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=290.14s)]
*  It's a disgrace. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=291.14s)]
*  Let me be clear on one thing, too. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=292.14s)]
*  You know something? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=294.74s)]
*  I don't want a weaponized system of justice to go after Democrats and treat them the way [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=295.82s)]
*  Donald Trump has been treated. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=302.7s)]
*  I want equal justice, equal application. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=304.5s)]
*  I'd like to have our Constitutional Republic back, and that's what I think most good, decent, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=307.42s)]
*  honorable Americans want. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=312.22s)]
*  Alina, you've been very generous with your time throughout this whole trial. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdnZNaLwp0&t=317.18s)]
