# Alan Dershowitz: This is outrageous
**Fox News:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo)
*  Joining us now, more analysis, Greg Jarrett, Harvard Law Professor, Alan Dershowitz. Professor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=0.0s)]
*  Dershowitz, I'll start with you. You wrote a bestselling book, Get Trump. Where did you get the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=5.28s)]
*  title for that book? I didn't make it up. I wish I were a creative and original, but I got it from, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=9.52s)]
*  obviously, Letitia James' campaign. She ought to be brought up before the bar. You should not have [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=17.84s)]
*  an elected prosecutor campaigning on the promise to get a particular defendant. Now, if she didn't [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=24.72s)]
*  get him, she would lose the election. This is a variation of Stalin and Beria back in the 1930s [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=32.56s)]
*  when the head of the KGB says to Stalin, show me the man, I'll find you the crime. This is, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=39.68s)]
*  show me the man, we know who it is, she told us who it was, Donald Trump, and we'll find you the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  fraud even though there was no harm. Generally in our legal system, particularly under the system [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=51.04s)]
*  of equity where you don't get a jury trial, if it's no harm, no foul, no harm, no fine, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=57.36s)]
*  but when you have no damages at all, usually you can do a multiple. Say there's a million [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=63.12s)]
*  dollars of damages, you can give three million dollar fine, but when you have zero damages, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=68.56s)]
*  no matter how many times you multiply it, zero plus and times whatever is all still zero. So, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=74.08s)]
*  it's outrageous. Now, I don't know whether it's going to be reversed in the appellate division. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=81.84s)]
*  The appellate division is also elected judges, mostly by Democrats in a county which is 85% [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=86.16s)]
*  Democrat. The New York court of appeals, which is the highest court, may indeed come and give [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=93.28s)]
*  justice. Generally fines like this are reduced considerably, and that may very well happen in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=98.88s)]
*  this case, but this tells us so much about the politicization of our justice system, the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  weaponization of our system, and it's so dangerous because it will mean that business people are not [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=110.56s)]
*  going to want to run for office because they know if they run for office, partisans are going to go [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  after them, investigate them, figure out some way of getting them like overvaluing. You know, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=122.08s)]
*  this is a judge which over evaluates when he wants to, $350 million for no damage, then under [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=128.32s)]
*  evaluates when he wants to, Mar-a-Lago $18 million. He's just willing to manipulate the numbers [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=134.64s)]
*  to get him to the result he wanted. I hope the courts will look at this with a very, very, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  very stringent eye. Let me stay on the issue, Greg Jarrett, of valuations because they're very [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=147.28s)]
*  subjective. The Deutsche Bank executive was 100% right. Any lending institution, and in the case [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=154.4s)]
*  of Donald Trump, you're talking about deals that are hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Nobody's going to lend you that much or insure that much of a property without doing their own [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=166.4s)]
*  valuation. They have a fiduciary responsibility to do so. There was a disclaimer that said, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=173.12s)]
*  don't trust our valuations within the application. It was in every single one. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=179.6s)]
*  I lost the sound of the computer. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=185.44s)]
*  Nobody was hurt. Nobody was hurt. They all got paid back on time with interest that they had [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=186.16s)]
*  agreed to. The only one really most guilty of valuation problems was the judge. The judge, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  to take a billion dollar property and stick with an $18 million valuation, please, I'll buy that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  right now. I will find $18 million and I will buy Mar-a-Lago for $18 million and I'll put it on the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=208.16s)]
*  market tomorrow for a billion. I'd like to be a billionaire one day. You might get a porta potty [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=214.32s)]
*  for $18 million in Palm Beach. Look, the damages here like the judge are daft and asinine because [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  under the law, damages must always reflect the measurable harm. Here there was no harm, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=230.8s)]
*  not a single person testified. They were injured. Just the opposite, the lending banks made huge [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=237.6s)]
*  profits. So how the world of consumer protection statute could be used to hold liable a businessman [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=242.72s)]
*  for a consumer harm that doesn't exist is one of the great legal mysteries. So I think at the very [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=249.04s)]
*  least, the New York's highest court should knock it down, even though the entire court is composed of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=255.92s)]
*  seven justices appointed by Democrats. But Letitia James knew she was playing with house money here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=261.28s)]
*  Liberal courts and a liberal trial judge Arthur Ngoran, who wore his anti-Trump bias on his sleeve, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=268.24s)]
*  arrogant, smug, obtuse. In his ruling, he pronounced Trump guilty of fraud, ignoring completely. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=275.68s)]
*  All the bank executives said, we weren't defrauded or deceived. He said Trump falsified financial [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=283.04s)]
*  statements, ignoring Trump never prepared the financials. He hired top lawyers, accountants, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  real estate experts. They calculated the assets and then the banks, as you point out, Sean, did [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=295.44s)]
*  due diligence. They concluded Trump had more than enough to secure the loans. They wanted to lend [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=301.28s)]
*  him more money. They still do. So I think Ngoran has managed to prove Charles Dickens right when [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=307.28s)]
*  he wrote the law is an ass. Yeah. All right. Greg Jarrett and Professor Dershowitz, we just lost. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=313.92s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zqb_RUmRlo&t=321.28s)]
