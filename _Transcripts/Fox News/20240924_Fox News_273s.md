# Lara Trump: You can’t convince people of bad policies
**Fox News:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ)
*  And with more, RNC co-chair Laura Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Laura, I don't know, am I conveying enough urgency about how I feel about the state of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=3.86s)]
*  the country? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=9.14s)]
*  Well, I hope so, and I hope people are paying attention, Sean, because, you know, you hear [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=10.14s)]
*  it every four years that this is the most important election, but I think it's palpable. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=15.06s)]
*  I think we can all feel how heavy this election is and really the implications of what happens [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  on November 5th, what that means not just for our country, but really the entire world [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=25.16s)]
*  at this point. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=29.779999999999998s)]
*  And look, you just went through a whole list of things with Kamala Harris. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=30.779999999999998s)]
*  They're having a hard time over at the Kamala Harris campaign selling people despite the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=35.18s)]
*  fact that they've had the full weight of the mainstream media behind her, despite the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=40.42s)]
*  fact that they've dumped hundreds of millions of dollars into trying to bolster her up and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=44.3s)]
*  trying to make her happen. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  She's just not happening for the American people, it turns out, because you can't convince [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=50.9s)]
*  people of bad policies. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=55.58s)]
*  You can't convince people to want to vote for radical ideas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=57.62s)]
*  And as you just mentioned, Donald Trump connects with the American people. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=61.58s)]
*  You cannot manufacture a connection with Kamala Harris because she doesn't connect with the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=66.02s)]
*  American people. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=71.92s)]
*  And I will say, I have to assume that it was maybe my trip down to our southern border [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=72.92s)]
*  last week that perhaps inspired our borders are to actually go down and check out the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  She has left totally unsecured for four years, letting millions of people just dump into [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=83.34s)]
*  our country, including known terrorists. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=87.86s)]
*  But to see her go down there, Sean, for a photo op, having seen the atrocities and the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=91.3s)]
*  horrors with my own eyes, man, what an empty trip and what an insult to the people who [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=96.76s)]
*  have to day in and day out at that southern border deal with what goes on down there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  It is really horrific to see. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=107.98s)]
*  You said it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=110.06s)]
*  If she wants to get something changed, go over and talk to Joe Biden and strong arm [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=111.26s)]
*  him just like you strong armed him out of the race for president and tell him to actually [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=114.86s)]
*  implement the laws as they're written on the book, Sean. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  But we know she will not do that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=122.54s)]
*  With the stroke of a pen, they eliminated all of the Trump border policies that work. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=125.22s)]
*  Stroke of a pen. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=130.5s)]
*  Why doesn't she go to Washington instead of getting the photo op 39 days before an election? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=131.62s)]
*  And why doesn't she put those policies back in place? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=137.78s)]
*  Then while she's there, maybe she can call Lake and Riley's family, Rachel Moran's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  family and Josso Nungary's family and the dozens of Americans who have family members [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=144.74s)]
*  murdered, the dozens that have family members raped, the dozens, the hundreds that are victims [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=149.46s)]
*  of violent crime by these illegal immigrants, and maybe apologize for the harm that she [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=155.38s)]
*  has caused them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=161.94s)]
*  I like that idea better. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=163.82s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=165.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=166.9s)]
*  Well, how about the 325,000 missing migrant children that have come over the border? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=167.4s)]
*  Nobody knows where they are. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  We can only imagine the horrors that they are probably facing right now, the 300,000 [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=174.06s)]
*  Americans who've died as a result of fentanyl that has poured over that southern border. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  But don't expect to see a lot of Kamala Harris, Sean, because you just talked about [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=182.78s)]
*  the Al Smith dinner. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=186.5s)]
*  There is a very obvious reason. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=187.5s)]
*  She cannot go to the Al Smith dinner. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=189.66s)]
*  They can't control Kamala Harris there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  They don't know. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=194.66s)]
*  Too many unknowns, too many variables, too many normal people she might interact with. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=195.66s)]
*  They cannot afford that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=199.98s)]
*  Most political campaigns, the goal is to expose your candidate. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=201.82s)]
*  You want them talking to the American people, sharing their ideas. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=205.42s)]
*  People need to get to know the candidate, unless that candidate is Kamala Harris. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  And then her campaign is estimated, the less you know about her and her radical ideas, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=212.94s)]
*  the better for them, which speaks volumes. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=217.66s)]
*  And I want to make sure everybody knows, if you live in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  Early voting has started. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=223.78s)]
*  Get out and vote. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=225.62s)]
*  Go tomorrow. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=226.62s)]
*  Call your friends. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=227.62s)]
*  Call your family. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=228.62s)]
*  Pick them up after you vote and take them out to vote. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=229.62s)]
*  Everyone needs to be voting in this election and taking people to go vote from that moment [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=232.58s)]
*  up to Election Day. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=237.28s)]
*  On my website, on my social media, on Hannity.com, I have a list of every state, how to register, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=239.54s)]
*  when early voting starts and ends. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  I also have the Kamala files, the Walls files, them in their own words. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=248.9s)]
*  And if you want, you can share it on social media with your friends, your family, your [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=253.94s)]
*  coworkers and your neighbors. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=257.14s)]
*  Laura Trump, thank you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m2UW1HviYQ&t=259.74s)]
