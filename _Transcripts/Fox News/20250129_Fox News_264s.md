# BREAKING: Reagan airport grounds flights after possible plane crash
**Fox News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y)
*  All right, we have breaking news and a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  All takeoffs and landings have been halted at Reagan National Airport just outside of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=5.48s)]
*  Washington D.C. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=10.76s)]
*  We're monitoring an apparent emergency situation in the Potomac River near the airport where, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=11.76s)]
*  according to local reports, an aircraft may have crashed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=17.0s)]
*  Joining us now at the very latest, our very own Kevin Kork. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=19.88s)]
*  Kevin, what's the latest? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Sean, I know you have flown into DCA a number of times, many, many times throughout your [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  career. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=30.0s)]
*  And as you know, when you come into Washington, particularly if you're coming in along the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=31.0s)]
*  Potomac River, it can be a bit of a windy alley. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=34.92s)]
*  To say nothing of the fact that we're talking about a fairly short porch to about 6,800 [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=38.8s)]
*  feet for that runway. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=43.52s)]
*  Now, we're not certain if that was a factor in tonight's event. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=44.92s)]
*  We do know this, that there are fire boats that have been dispatched responding to a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=49.2s)]
*  small aircraft crash or and or, Sean, a collision with a helicopter. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=54.48s)]
*  That's just some of the preliminary information that we are getting at this hour. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=61.64s)]
*  As you see the live pictures from our Fox affiliate, Channel 5 here in Washington, WTTG, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=65.64s)]
*  you can see an enormous response right along the Potomac River there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=72.28s)]
*  Now, there are conflicting reports, Sean, so I want to be careful as I share some of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=76.52s)]
*  these details. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=80.08s)]
*  Again, information changes minute by minute. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  There have been some reports that there could be dozens of individuals in the water. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=84.52s)]
*  There have been other reports that fire boats have been dispatched and have been pulling [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=89.48s)]
*  survivors from the water. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=94.6s)]
*  It is nearly February. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=96.92s)]
*  And so, of course, that means that water is extremely cold. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=98.64s)]
*  It adds to the precarious nature of the circumstance that we are all witnessing here in Washington. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=101.86s)]
*  There is a fairly high number of aircraft that come in and out of Reagan during the evening. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=107.83999999999999s)]
*  A lot of Congress personnel, a lot of Capitol Hill personnel come in and out of town late [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  after visiting their districts. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  And so this is a very active airport throughout the day, but in particular in the evenings. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=119.52s)]
*  So we're not certain exactly what happened here, Sean. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=125.56s)]
*  I'm watching, as are you, everything that we can get from DC Fire and Emergency Medical [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=128.16s)]
*  Services. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=133.24s)]
*  At last check, DCA, Reagan National, has been in a full hold, a complete travel halt, for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=134.76000000000002s)]
*  the time being. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=142.84s)]
*  Now, usually that's precautionary, and then eventually they will re-allow aircraft to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=143.84s)]
*  come in and out of the airport. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, if that's the case, we could be double-checking that at the top of the hour. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  Generally, that's when they make these assessments. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  But as of this moment, we have a full ground stop in effect at Reagan National, a possible [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=158.84s)]
*  aircraft collision between an aircraft, a fixed-wing aircraft, a plane, and possibly [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=164.68s)]
*  a helicopter. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=170.32s)]
*  That was one report. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=171.84s)]
*  We also have a separate report, Sean, as I mentioned, that is just the one aircraft that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=173.0s)]
*  went down. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=177.24s)]
*  Now, I did mention a number. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=178.24s)]
*  It's a fairly large number. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=181.12s)]
*  There have been some reports, as many as 60 people could have been involved in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=182.6s)]
*  downing of this aircraft. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  And that means we could be looking at possibly dozens of individuals, both alive and possibly [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=190.04s)]
*  perished in the water. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=195.44s)]
*  It is cold. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=197.44s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=198.44s)]
*  And as you see, a massive response. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=199.44s)]
*  We're keeping an eye on it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=201.28s)]
*  And of course, as I get more information, Sean, I'll pass it along to you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=202.28s)]
*  Did I hear you right, that there may be, you're hearing a report, as many as 60 people? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=206.72s)]
*  Yes, 60. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=211.6s)]
*  Six-zero, which would be a terrible shock. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=213.16s)]
*  And that's the real issue. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=216.44s)]
*  When you see a response like that, naturally, regardless of the size of the aircraft, you [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=218.5s)]
*  would expect a massive response. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=223.12s)]
*  But when you see fireboats in the water immediately, and there have been, again, some reports that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=225.44s)]
*  it could be dozens of people, needless to say, all hands on deck tonight here in Washington. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=230.76s)]
*  I do need to remind the audience, after 9-11-01, a lot of private planes are no longer allowed [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  to land at Reagan Airport. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  And they are diverted. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  They get people go to Dallas instead, which means the odds of it being a commercial flight [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  of some kind are much higher, I would argue, just based on the rules that changed after [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=257.68s)]
*  9-11. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB14JMx4Y-Y&t=262.92s)]
