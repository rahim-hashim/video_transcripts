# Victor Davis Hanson: 'Elites' are 'forcing' open borders down everyone's throat
**Fox News:** [April 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE)
*  All right, voters in Chicago, by the way, rallied together at a city council meeting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=0.0s)]
*  on Wednesday to protest Mayor Johnson's proposal to give a whopping 70 million taxpayer dollars [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=5.0s)]
*  to illegal immigrants. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=10.72s)]
*  Now, Chicago has already spent millions on the illegals that are wreaking havoc in the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  city between the migrant crisis and brazen crime. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=17.0s)]
*  Residents, they're fed up. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=20.36s)]
*  Here's what they had to say at last night's meeting. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=21.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=24.0s)]
*  Our city government, now that I understand, has basically turned their back on black Chicagoans. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=25.0s)]
*  We need that money in my neighborhood. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=30.52s)]
*  We need that on my block. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=33.08s)]
*  To align yourself with somebody who's obviously a one-term mayor, if he even makes it that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=34.8s)]
*  far, you better be worried about your job. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=40.4s)]
*  All right, here with Reaction Hoover, Institution Senior Fellow Victor Davis-Hansen is with [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=43.2s)]
*  us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=48.6s)]
*  I read your column about what might be in favor of Joe Biden this election season and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=49.6s)]
*  what might work against him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=56.84s)]
*  And as you look at it through the prism, for example, of this town hall, maybe explain [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=59.08s)]
*  it to people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=65.12s)]
*  Well, I think what we're watching is a historic change, really, in the political parties. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=66.12s)]
*  This issue of an open border is an elite issue. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=73.92s)]
*  The elites want it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=76.64s)]
*  They think they want 10 million constituents or bodies, basically, for big government and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=78.08s)]
*  change in congressional districts. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=84.36s)]
*  But the people don't want it, and they're trying to force it down their throat, just [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=85.92s)]
*  like the transgender issue, just like the climate change, just like the no bail. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=90.28s)]
*  And the people who suffer are their supposed constituents. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=94.88s)]
*  For every person that comes across that border, they're going to loseâ€”if it's 10 million, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=98.66s)]
*  they're going to lose 15 million voters. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=102.72s)]
*  And they're not aware of it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=104.72s)]
*  They think they have a hold on it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=107.28s)]
*  But what's happening, Sean, is that those people in that room that are yelling at Mayor [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=108.28s)]
*  Johnson have more in common with people in East Palestine than they do Oprah Winfrey [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=113.56s)]
*  or Barack Obama. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=118.64s)]
*  And people in East Palestine have more in common with those people in Chicago than they [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=120.04s)]
*  do Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg or the Bidens. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  And the same goes true for Mexican-American people in the Central Valley or the Rio Grande [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=129.34s)]
*  Valley. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=133.56s)]
*  So, if you can change that racial obsession and replace it with a shared class interest [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  that says, we're interested in our American constituencies, we don't like inflation, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=141.84s)]
*  we want law and order, we want a border, we don't care about these other issues about [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=148.12s)]
*  banning natural gas, and we don't want three bathrooms, we don't care about somebody [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=153.32s)]
*  in Mexico saying they have a right to come into Chicago and get ahead of us in line at [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=158.88s)]
*  a health center. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=163.76s)]
*  This is a radical change, this idea of class affinities rather than the old tribalism. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=164.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=170.32s)]
*  Well, in 200 days, a lot can certainly happen. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=171.32s)]
*  Do you think the trial backfires in New York, the New York trial on Trump, but does it backfire [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=174.8s)]
*  on Democrats? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=180.96s)]
*  If Donald Trump keeps this split-screen imagery, he's up in Harlem, they're on MSNBC attacking [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=184.6s)]
*  him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=191.36s)]
*  In the wake of an NYPD officer, they're trying to shake down donors for 26 million. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=192.44000000000003s)]
*  He's at Chick-fil-A, they're at a White House dinner with Robert De Niro, yes, he can do [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=197.52s)]
*  it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=202.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=203.96s)]
*  It's going to be, well, we begin our 200-day countdown from tonight. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=204.96s)]
*  Victor Davis Sands, a great article. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_T_vGZPQE&t=208.96s)]
