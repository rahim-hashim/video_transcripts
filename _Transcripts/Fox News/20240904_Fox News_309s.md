# Trump: The ‘sickest people’ are being dumped into our country
**Fox News:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU)
*  We did a good campaign, but the next time we had something, we had something special. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=0.0s)]
*  We could talk about what we did. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=6.28s)]
*  But we never could imagine we'd have borders where 20 million people are poured into our [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=7.88s)]
*  country, many criminals from all over the world are coming into our country. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  They're coming from jails from not just South America, from all over the world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=19.06s)]
*  They're coming in at levels that nobody's ever seen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=24.16s)]
*  They're coming from prisons. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=27.04s)]
*  They're allowing prisoners to come out of all countries. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  They had a hundred, almost 180 countries represented over the last number of months. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=31.639999999999997s)]
*  180. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=37.56s)]
*  Most people don't know that you have that many countries. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=38.56s)]
*  They're emptying out their prisons and jails. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=40.92s)]
*  They're emptying out their mental institutions and insane asylums. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=42.96s)]
*  They're emptying out the sickest people and they're emptying all into the United States. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=47.56s)]
*  And you said it better than anybody. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=55.32s)]
*  More terrorists have come into the United States in the last three years than I think [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=57.44s)]
*  probably 50 years. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=61.8s)]
*  There's never been anything like it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=64.24s)]
*  These people are so bad. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  They're so dangerous. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=67.08s)]
*  What they've done to our country is they're destroying our country and we can't let this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=68.56s)]
*  happen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=72.96s)]
*  If they won, you'd have not 20 million, you'll have a hundred million people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=73.96s)]
*  You won't have Social Security. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=78.62s)]
*  You won't have Medicare. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=80.28s)]
*  You won't have anything already. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=82.44s)]
*  If you take a look at the numbers, they're filling up and loading up Social Security, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=84.52s)]
*  Medicare with illegal immigrants that have come into our country, many of them from jails [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  and many of them from very bad places. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  And we're not going to destroy our country, Sean. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=96.44s)]
*  Well, let me, I'm going to play Kamala Harris and the comments that she has made about the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  border because I think this is important. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=106.8s)]
*  I want to play her in her own words about this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=109.6s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=111.96s)]
*  We have people, almost 11 million plus. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  We don't know how many gotaways there are. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  We have hundreds of known terrorists that have entered the country. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=117.36s)]
*  We don't know what countries they've come from. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=120.44s)]
*  We're allowing people in. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=122.72s)]
*  They've come in from Iran, Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, China, tens and tens of thousands, Russia, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=123.72s)]
*  Venezuela. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=130.64s)]
*  I don't think they're coming here because they want a better life as maybe some other [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  people are. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=135.72s)]
*  And we know nothing about them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=137.56s)]
*  We haven't vetted them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  I scroll the names often on this show of people that have been murdered, people that have [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=140.16s)]
*  been raped, people victims of violent crime. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=146.28s)]
*  And all this is all happening by unvetted Harris Biden, illegal immigrants. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=150.12s)]
*  What is your well, I can play your tape. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=155.64s)]
*  I'll play that maybe after your answer. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  But what is your reaction to the you've spoken to some of the families? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=159.72s)]
*  I said at the beginning, I said when they I heard they were going to have open borders. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=163.6s)]
*  They want open borders. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=168.28s)]
*  She wants open borders. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=169.4s)]
*  Now she's all of a sudden. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=170.4s)]
*  So I go, I think we'll close the borders. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=171.4s)]
*  She was the borders are whether you like it or not. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=173.8s)]
*  But even if you don't want to use that term, she was in charge of the border. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=175.9s)]
*  It's the worst border in the history of the world, not just here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=179.48s)]
*  There's never been a country that allowed 21 million people to come in over a three [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=182.72s)]
*  year period. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=186.44s)]
*  There's never been. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=187.44s)]
*  And 21 million people, many of whom are from prisons, many of whom are murderers and drug [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=188.44s)]
*  dealers and child traffickers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=197.56s)]
*  And by the way, women traffickers, you know, women trafficking is the biggest and they're [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=200.68s)]
*  traffickers and women and they're coming in now and they're putting them in our Social [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  Security accounts and they're putting them in Medicare. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  And just just one thing, if you take a look, take a look over the last week, I said this [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=214.4s)]
*  was going to happen and it's happening because these people are tougher than our criminals. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=220.8s)]
*  Our criminals are nice people by comparison. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=225.24s)]
*  That's the only good thing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=227.48s)]
*  We're showing how nice our criminals are. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=228.88s)]
*  They came from 22 people recently came from the Congo in Africa. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=231.89999999999998s)]
*  Where do you come from? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  Prison? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  We refuse to say we're letting everybody in. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  We're letting everybody in. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=242.06s)]
*  Take a look at Aurora in Colorado, where Venezuelans are taking over the whole town. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=243.66s)]
*  They're taking over buildings, the whole town and the sheriff who can blame them? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=252.56s)]
*  I mean, they have AK-47s. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=257.0s)]
*  You saw it the other day. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=259.24s)]
*  They're knocking down doors and occupying apartments of people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  The people are petrified and it's getting worse and worse. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=264.2s)]
*  You look at New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and now you look at all over the place. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=267.58000000000004s)]
*  You take a look at Iowa, Idaho, places that never had the problem. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  They're pouring in 21 million people that's bigger than New York and we have to stop it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=280.68s)]
*  We have to do the largest deportation in the history of... [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8buPEhxOAU&t=286.64s)]
