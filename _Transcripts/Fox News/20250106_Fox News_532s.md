# Sean Hannity: The White House has been trying to sabotage Trump
**Fox News:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ)
*  And welcome to Hannity and happy new year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It is a new year. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=3.4s)]
*  A new administration is about to take the reins in D.C. in the swamp. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=4.4s)]
*  And the good news is, time to celebrate, but a lot of hard work ahead. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=8.36s)]
*  Now, today on Capitol Hill, as part of her official duties, a very unhappy-looking Kamala [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=12.24s)]
*  Harris, well, she was forced to certify the results of the election she herself lost. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=18.12s)]
*  Now, it's only a matter of days before Donald Trump gets sworn into office, not a moment [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=23.0s)]
*  too soon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=27.64s)]
*  Joe Biden has never been fit to serve as president. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=28.8s)]
*  Every day he's getting worse and worse over the weekend. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=32.22s)]
*  Well, this is how the president answered a question about birthright citizenship. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=35.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=40.4s)]
*  By the way, the actions we take, the only thing, by being the oldest president, I know [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=41.4s)]
*  more world leaders than any one of you ever met in your whole f***ing life. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=48.36s)]
*  And I know them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=53.44s)]
*  I know how they think. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=54.44s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=55.44s)]
*  And he forgot the words when he was singing Happy Birthday. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  This, a pathetic end to, frankly, the worst presidency in the modern era. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=60.04s)]
*  Joe Biden did not accomplish any of his stated goals. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=65.8s)]
*  He certainly did not unite the country. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=68.56s)]
*  He didn't rebuild the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=70.88s)]
*  He didn't improve your life, America's standing around the world. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=74.92s)]
*  In his final months in office, Biden has been singularly focused on three things, granting [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=79.08s)]
*  clemency to criminals, including his own son, handing out awards to Democratic mega donors [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=85.16s)]
*  and radical leftists, Hollywood celebrities, some of the most loathed, self-serving politicians [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=90.88s)]
*  in America. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=96.8s)]
*  Oh, let's see, Hillary Clinton, Liz Cheney, and then of course there's George Soros. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=97.8s)]
*  And last and not least, whoever is running the show in the White House with Joe's approval [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=104.06s)]
*  has been up to their eyeballs and doing nothing but trying to sabotage the incoming Trump [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=110.56s)]
*  administration and his agenda at home and abroad. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=117.56s)]
*  The Biden administration, they didn't lift a finger to secure the border or reduce crime [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=121.32s)]
*  or bring down inflation for nearly four years. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=125.4s)]
*  Price of gasoline went up about $1.58 a gallon. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=128.48s)]
*  They lied the entire time about all of this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=131.28s)]
*  And now these last minute executive actions are all designed to undermine Donald Trump [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=134.32000000000002s)]
*  and they're coming in hot and they're coming in fast. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=140.36s)]
*  Now, new this week, with the stroke of a pen, Joe Biden just issued a total ban on most [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  offshore drilling and exploration. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, if you really step back and think about it, he knows Trump is drill baby drill. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  He's not hurting Trump as much as he's hurting you and the poor and the middle class [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=156.08s)]
*  and the cost of everything that's delivered to every store you go to. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  The cost of energy hurts the American people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=166.76s)]
*  It also prevents America and our ability to become what Donald Trump is certainly set [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=170.16s)]
*  out to do, make us an energy dominant rich country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=176.38s)]
*  Last week he proposed another ban that's limiting energy development in Nevada for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=181.42s)]
*  the next 20 years before getting blocked by a Texas court. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=185.88s)]
*  Biden, petty, angry, bitter? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=190.04s)]
*  Well, he attempted to auction off border wall materials for next to nothing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=192.64s)]
*  Again, that would only force you to pay for a new border wall. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=197.92s)]
*  He vindictively wants to sell off for pennies on the dollar, knowing that Donald Trump will [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  need to spend more of your money because he's going to build the wall. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=206.92s)]
*  He also streamlined illegal immigration with the release of a brand new app designed for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=211.0s)]
*  those looking to abuse our immigration and border laws. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=215.88s)]
*  And meanwhile, today the president released 11 Gitmo detainees captured in the aftermath [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=220.16s)]
*  of 9-11, sent them back to the Middle East. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=225.24s)]
*  And in Europe, Biden has escalated the war in Ukraine with Russia, giving Ukraine billions [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=228.29999999999998s)]
*  of new funding, including 2.5 billion since the election, along with weapons that can [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=233.64s)]
*  now strike deep within Russia. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=239.24s)]
*  Now, Trump said that Biden is doing everything possible to make this transition difficult [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  and is now vowing to reverse Joe's executive orders on day one. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=246.08s)]
*  He will. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  But Trump does not have an easy job ahead of him. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  This brings us to some much needed perspective. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=253.84s)]
*  We said on our first show last year that this would be an inflection point for the country. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=257.72s)]
*  And we did warn you what the Democrats would do. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=263.94s)]
*  Would you imagine, by the way, if this first show of 2025, we were just a mere two weeks [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=266.2s)]
*  away from Kamala Harris being inaugurated, what would that be? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=271.52s)]
*  That'd be a mandate for open borders. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=275.44s)]
*  That would mean more terrorists, criminal cartels, gang members in the country unvetted. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=277.48s)]
*  That would be a continuation of defund, dismantle, no bail laws. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=282.4s)]
*  That would mean higher taxes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=286.04s)]
*  That would mean higher energy prices. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=287.46s)]
*  That would mean government mandates on cars and gas stoves and washers and dryers and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=289.56s)]
*  your air conditioners. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=294.70000000000005s)]
*  You'd have woke education for your kids, taxpayer-funded sex change operations, gender-affirming care [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=296.18s)]
*  without parental consent, and of course, weakness on the world stage and endless war. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=302.22s)]
*  But let me caution you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=307.82000000000005s)]
*  As I rightly predicted in the beginning of 2024, let me predict here. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  The left's plan to simply run on their hate Trump agenda didn't work. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=314.06s)]
*  2025's outcome is not certain. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=319.62s)]
*  Like 2024, this time a year ago, the outcome of the election was not certain. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  Many of you watching tonight, frankly, you saved our country from the radical left. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=328.97999999999996s)]
*  This was the biggest choice, inflection point election in our lifetime. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=333.58s)]
*  All of you delivered. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=338.62s)]
*  The work is far from over. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=340.32s)]
*  Trump is going to need your help. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=342.56s)]
*  He's a slim majority in Congress. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=343.82s)]
*  And we've got to urge unity on Capitol Hill, and that unity needs to be around Donald Trump's [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=346.62s)]
*  MAGA agenda. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  He ran. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=354.18s)]
*  He ran hard. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=355.18s)]
*  He made promises. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  And he won. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=357.88s)]
*  And he helped a lot of these people across the finish line. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=359.22s)]
*  At one point, it was predicted, what, an 80 percent chance Democrats would gain control [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=362.06s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=366.58s)]
*  Remember what Reagan said. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=367.58s)]
*  A person that agrees with you 80 percent of the time is not your enemy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=369.18s)]
*  Trump with the small majority in Congress, there are things he cannot do on his own that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  got to be done, especially if we are to return to constitutional order, if we believe in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=379.26s)]
*  limited government and greater freedom. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=385.58s)]
*  If you want to secure the border, deport illegal immigrants, especially criminal illegal immigrants, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  you know, if you want to reenergize the economy, if you literally want to reignite America's [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=394.02s)]
*  energy dominance and make us the most energy-rich country on the face of the earth, restore [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=400.62s)]
*  law and order, restore America's military might, peace through strength, bring accountability [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=405.8s)]
*  to the deep state and the DOJ, a weaponized FBI, weaponized intelligence community. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=412.48s)]
*  If you want to make doge a reality and cut $2 trillion from spending and prepare this [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=418.12s)]
*  country for the next generation of warfare, because we've got to face a reality. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=423.8s)]
*  Future wars will not be fought on a battlefield. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=429.88000000000005s)]
*  They're going to be fought in air-conditioned offices, a bunch of guys pushing buttons. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=433.4s)]
*  China, Russia right now, they have hypersonic missile technology that we do not have. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=437.24s)]
*  We need to match, we need to surpass their capabilities, and that needs to be done immediately. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=442.88s)]
*  And by the way, I kind of like the idea, maybe you'll join me, of Greenland, Canada joining [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=448.92s)]
*  the U.S. I think we should invite them in. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=454.32s)]
*  And by the way, without the U.S., the Panama Canal would not exist. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cG-SBi29xQ&t=457.44s)]
