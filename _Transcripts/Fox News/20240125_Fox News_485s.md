# Eric Trump: The media is absolutely petrified
**Fox News:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs)
*  I'm here with reaction from the Trump Organization. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=0.0s)]
*  Eric Trump is with us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=2.24s)]
*  You know, there hasn't been—well, first of all, in Iowa, there's never been a person [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=3.84s)]
*  that won by a larger margin than Bob Dole, which was 1988, and that margin, I think, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=8.64s)]
*  was 12.8 percent. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=14.84s)]
*  Your father won by 30 points in Iowa. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=16.56s)]
*  Your father comes back and does something that hasn't been done since 1976. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=19.44s)]
*  He wins Iowa, then goes on to win New Hampshire, and he wins it by double digits. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=24.32s)]
*  In a state, frankly, whose system of voting and primaries I don't like—I don't like [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=29.36s)]
*  open primaries—Republicans should elect Republican candidates, in my view. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=34.32s)]
*  Democrats should elect Democratic candidates. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=38.32s)]
*  You can't deny these are historic results for your father. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=40.96s)]
*  There's no question about that, Sean. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=46.56s)]
*  Frankly, that's exactly why the mainstream media is so petrified of him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=47.84s)]
*  It's why they go on and, you know, do the clips that you just showed right there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=50.72s)]
*  They're petrified of him. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=54.24s)]
*  He won the largest margin ever in a primary in Iowa, as you just said, the largest margin [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=55.36s)]
*  ever in New Hampshire. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=60.4s)]
*  He received—yesterday, he received the most votes in a primary ever in the history of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=62.56s)]
*  New Hampshire. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=68.0s)]
*  And by the way, he's beating Biden in every single national poll, many of them by 10, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=68.8s)]
*  11, 12, some 15 percent. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=73.84s)]
*  The media is absolutely petrified. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=76.24s)]
*  My father is the greatest guy in the world. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=78.4s)]
*  He wants strong borders. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=80.0s)]
*  He wants a great economy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  He wants a strong military. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=82.64s)]
*  He doesn't want to see this country go into War III. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=83.92s)]
*  He's sick and tired of the games. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=87.2s)]
*  They're sick and tired of the nonsense. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  And I think the enthusiasm, Sean, that we're seeing all over the place, these massive turnouts, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=90.48s)]
*  is the American people who want our country back. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=95.76s)]
*  They're tired of the worst president in the history of this country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=99.52s)]
*  By far, hands down, it's not even close. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=102.56s)]
*  They want a strong guy back in the White House. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  And that's exactly what my father will do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=107.12s)]
*  And that's exactly who my father is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=108.56s)]
*  You know, you look at, for example, the media. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  This is now two pri—well, one caucus, one primary in. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=114.0s)]
*  And here you got Joe Biden. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=117.44s)]
*  He lies and says the border's secure and the border's closed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=119.28s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=122.96s)]
*  It's never been true since he's been president. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  We can see it with our own eyes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  He brags about Bidenomics. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  60 percent of Americans now live paycheck to paycheck. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=129.28s)]
*  He lies. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=133.04s)]
*  You know, I never once spoke to my son, my brother or anybody about their foreign business [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=134.0s)]
*  deals, and he's up to his eyeballs in it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=139.84s)]
*  And yet here we have a caucus and a primary. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  Your dad's giving a speech, a victory speech, and fake news CNN wants to fact check him [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  in real time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=150.48s)]
*  MSDNC wants to do the same after they were excoriated for not even taking a single word [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=151.44s)]
*  of your father's speech. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=156.88s)]
*  That's NBC News. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=158.16s)]
*  Now, what is your reaction to that part of it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=159.84s)]
*  Because we took your dad's speech. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=163.68s)]
*  It was in my hour, in this hour. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  And we ran the whole thing so people can decide for themselves. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=168.56s)]
*  What's your reaction to how they handle this? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=172.88s)]
*  Well, Sean, does that shock anybody? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=176.48s)]
*  I mean, they've been censoring my father since, you know, the minute he went down the escalator. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=177.92s)]
*  Anything they put out that he would censor, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=182.16s)]
*  Any any all his press conferences, they would censor. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=184.4s)]
*  They would distort his words. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=187.2s)]
*  They kicked him off of Twitter. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=188.8s)]
*  They kicked him off of Instagram. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=189.84s)]
*  I mean, any chance that they could remove a public platform for my father to use to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=191.28s)]
*  communicate to the American people? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=195.84s)]
*  They did. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=197.6s)]
*  Does it surprise you that MSDNC is doing the same thing on New Hampshire primary night? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=198.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=203.2s)]
*  Does it surprise you that CNN is doing the exact same thing? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=203.68s)]
*  Again, Sean, they're petrified of my father and his message. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=206.16s)]
*  My father is the one person who does not need this job. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  I talk about that all the time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=211.12s)]
*  His life would be exponentially better if he was at Mar-a-Lago, if he's enjoying life, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=212.16s)]
*  if he's enjoying his grandkids. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=216.24s)]
*  The guy wants to save this country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=217.84s)]
*  Our whole family wants to save this country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=219.28s)]
*  Our Republic is going down the tubes based on pure incompetence. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=221.92s)]
*  You just mentioned the border a second ago. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=226.4s)]
*  I mean, if Biden was so focused on the border, why does he have federal agents going and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=227.92s)]
*  cutting the barbed wire to allow legal immigrants into this country? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=231.6s)]
*  I mean, why would he be doing that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=234.48s)]
*  If he cared so much about our economy, why would he have allowed inflation to hit 10%? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  He could have brought down gas prices. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=242.64s)]
*  My father had the lowest gas prices in the history of this nation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  The first thing Biden did was he put a ban on the Keystone XL pipeline. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=247.04s)]
*  He stopped all drilling. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=250.24s)]
*  He effectively did a moratorium on oil and gas. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=251.84s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=254.88s)]
*  Inflation shot through the roof. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=255.84s)]
*  And inflation was massively outpacing wage growth in this country, which was cramming down [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  the ordinary people in this country. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=263.68s)]
*  He was making their lives exponentially harder. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=265.6s)]
*  If he cared about the economy, why would he have done that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=267.6s)]
*  It's reckless. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=271.68s)]
*  This guy's policies are reckless. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=272.4s)]
*  It's driving our country into the ground. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=274.16s)]
*  We're not perceived as strong anywhere in the world. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=276.16s)]
*  I mean, literally other countries around the world, we have properties in some of these [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=278.88s)]
*  countries. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  They're laughing at us. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=282.72s)]
*  They're laughing at the United States of America. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  You have Zelensky last week that literally went to Switzerland to try and negotiate peace. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=285.52s)]
*  Wasn't that always America's place in the world? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  You go to America to negotiate peace. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=293.12s)]
*  You don't go to Switzerland. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=294.64s)]
*  You don't go to France. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  You don't go to these other countries. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=296.32s)]
*  You know, you come to America, but we don't have that standing in the world anymore. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  We're losing our currency. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=301.2s)]
*  We're losing our culture. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=302.64s)]
*  We're losing our freedoms. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=303.68s)]
*  We're losing our constitution. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=305.44s)]
*  We're losing God in society. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  We're losing it all because we have an incompetent human being in the White House. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  And we need strength again. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  And my father will do an unbelievable job. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=313.84s)]
*  He will get this ship back on track in about two seconds flat. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=316.08s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  And I've talked to a lot of people today and Nikki Haley is not even competing in Nevada. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=321.67999999999995s)]
*  I'm not really sure why. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=328.23999999999995s)]
*  Apparently, I guess she didn't file the right paperwork. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=330.96s)]
*  Something happened. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=333.2s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  But then the next state that they will compete in is her home state of South Carolina. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=335.12s)]
*  Currently, the Real Clear Politics average has your data by 30 points. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  Is it even really worth your dad's time to engage in that part of the primary? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=344.64s)]
*  And maybe it's time to pivot and really go after Joe Biden? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, listen, I think you can do both at the same time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=356.64s)]
*  And I thought it was funny. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=358.4s)]
*  I was standing right behind my father last night and she mentioned competency. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  Yet she lost by 30 points in the first. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  She came in third in Iowa. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=366.64s)]
*  She lost decisively last night in New Hampshire. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=368.55999999999995s)]
*  She filed the wrong paperwork, so she's not going to be on the ballot next week. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=371.84s)]
*  So my father's going to go running away with Nevada. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=374.48s)]
*  And then he's going to go beat her in her home state of South Carolina by a lot. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=377.44s)]
*  And I don't think there's a single elected official in the state who's actually endorsed [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=380.48s)]
*  her, which tells you probably everything you need to know about the actual person. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=384.08s)]
*  So I think my father can do both. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he's clearly going to win Nevada. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=388.8s)]
*  He's clearly going to win South Carolina. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think he's going to win every single state on Super Tuesday. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=392.24s)]
*  In fact, it's upsetting to me, Sean, because at this point, I truly believe that she's just [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  in the race to be a spoiler. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=398.96s)]
*  And when you see the majority of her donors are Democratic operatives or, frankly, rhinos. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=401.12s)]
*  I mean, look at the same person who's one of her largest donors is the very guy who's funding [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=406.72s)]
*  many of the lawsuits against my father right now. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=412.0s)]
*  So many of the things he has to stay in New York and fight every single day. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=414.08s)]
*  Reid Hoffman. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=417.6s)]
*  Does that surprise anybody? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=418.64s)]
*  Does it surprise anybody that 70% of the people who voted for Nikki Haley yesterday [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=419.68s)]
*  were not Republicans? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=424.8s)]
*  They were Democrats and some independents? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=426.4s)]
*  I mean, Sean, at this point, I truly believe she's being paid or something to be in the race [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=428.88s)]
*  as a pure spoiler. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=434.24s)]
*  And the party should not put up with that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  We need to focus our guns on Joe Biden. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=439.04s)]
*  She has to win for her to be competitive. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  And so far, that's not going to happen. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=444.64s)]
*  And if she can overcome a 30-point deficit in South Carolina, that would shock me. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=446.64s)]
*  Your dad has the current governor, the sitting governor, two sitting senators, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=452.8s)]
*  most of the congressional delegation. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=456.72s)]
*  And I read somewhere a total of about 150 statewide officials that are endorsing him. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  Eric Trump, great to have you back, sir. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=464.88000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=466.48s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=466.8s)]
*  Just don't like her. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=467.6s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCR9lQz3-rs&t=471.04s)]
