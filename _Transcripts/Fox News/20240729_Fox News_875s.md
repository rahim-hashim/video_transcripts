# Sean Hannity: Kamala Harris is the 'Squad on steroids'
**Fox News:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, Kamala Harris has a lot of explaining to do, but don't expect any tough questions [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=2.5s)]
*  from the state-run media mob. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Now, the other networks, newspapers, they have zero interest in ever vetting the soon-to-be [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=9.88s)]
*  Democratic nominee. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=16.3s)]
*  In fact, they really prefer that America forget Kamala's radical record, the most radical [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=17.3s)]
*  person by far to ever seek the presidency. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=24.92s)]
*  So, as per usual, we will do the media mob, state-run media's job, and actually vet Kamala [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=29.08s)]
*  Harris. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  We have a lot of new information to share with you tonight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  And to be honest, this is kind of a layup. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=38.6s)]
*  I'd like to tell you it's hard. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=41.12s)]
*  You just got to do the research and play her in her own words. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=42.12s)]
*  It's not that difficult. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=46.32s)]
*  Kamala's on tape giving her position on almost every single issue you can possibly think [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=47.32s)]
*  of. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=53.32s)]
*  She's on tape. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=54.32s)]
*  We played it for you, calling for an end to private health insurance. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=55.32s)]
*  She's on tape calling for a single-payer socialist health care system. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  She's on tape calling for the federal government to confiscate your firearms through a mandatory [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=62.16s)]
*  gun buyback program. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=67.56s)]
*  She's on tape supporting a 70 to 90 percent tax rate. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=69.56s)]
*  She's on tape pushing for AOC's Green New Deal, introduced it in the Senate. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=73.72s)]
*  Even if she has to get rid of the filibuster, she's on tape saying that, too. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=79.0s)]
*  She's on tape supporting the riots in the summer of 2020. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=83.44s)]
*  She's on tape supporting defund, dismantle, no bail, and sanity. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=87.2s)]
*  She's on tape comparing ICE to the KKK and calling for ICE to be abolished. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=91.36s)]
*  She's on tape advocating for illegal immigration to be decriminalized. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=96.88s)]
*  She's on tape calling for you, your taxpayers in this country, to cover the bill for illegal [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=101.56s)]
*  immigrants' health care, housing and food. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=107.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  The bill also says, quote, every individual who is a resident of the United States is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  entitled to benefits for health care services under this act. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=116.36s)]
*  Not every individual who's a citizen, but every individual who's a resident. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  So you support giving universal health care, Medicare for all, to people who are in this [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=123.08s)]
*  country illegally? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=128.68s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=131.56s)]
*  to public safety, public education, or public health, period. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=138.76s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=145.0s)]
*  New tonight, Kamala Harris. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=146.0s)]
*  You're going to love this one. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  She's on tape calling for Americans to have the courage to reject the term radical Islamic [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  terrorism and the term, you have to have the courage to do this, to reject the term illegal [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=156.36s)]
*  alien. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=162.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=163.56s)]
*  You must have the courage to object when they use that term radical Islamic terrorism, which [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=164.56s)]
*  is more than the greatest victims of terror. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=174.16s)]
*  And we must also have the courage to reject that term illegal alien. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=181.16s)]
*  I have seen some of the worst of criminal behavior. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=194.16s)]
*  I have seen the worst of crime. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=197.16s)]
*  An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=199.16s)]
*  We must have the courage to reject her and her radicalism if we want to save the country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=204.16s)]
*  Is anyone going to ask her if radical Islamic terrorists killed 2,977 Americans on 9-11-01 [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=210.66s)]
*  or thousands of other Americans that had 9-11-related illnesses or the thousands that lost their [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=219.66s)]
*  lives in limbs fighting a war against radical Islamic terrorists? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  Are we really to believe that the over 11 million unvetted Biden-Harris illegal immigrants [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=231.12s)]
*  that crossed our secure borders, as they call them, are not here illegally? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=237.12s)]
*  Again, there has never been a major party candidate for president more radical than [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=243.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=249.12s)]
*  She is to the left of AOC. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=250.76s)]
*  She is to the left of the squad. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=253.36s)]
*  She's the squad on steroids. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=255.76s)]
*  And it's not just words. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=258.68s)]
*  You know, since taking over, as borders are, and in spite of their denial, Joe said he [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=259.68s)]
*  did task her with the job of fixing the problem at the border, more than 11 million Joe Biden-Kamala [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=264.32s)]
*  Harris unvetted illegal immigrants have entered our country. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=270.64s)]
*  Now, this includes radical Islamic terrorists, people with terror ties. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=274.12s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=278.4s)]
*  When Donald Trump was president, terror watchlist encounters at the border ranged from zero [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=279.88s)]
*  per year to a high of six. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=285.24s)]
*  Under Kamala's leadership, nearly 170 encountered at the border just last year, and so far this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=288.04s)]
*  year we're almost up to 100 new ones, and those are only the apprehensions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=294.64s)]
*  Remember, we have the quote, Godaway number. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=299.64s)]
*  That likely makes that number much higher. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=303.36s)]
*  We probably have terror cells in this country because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=305.68s)]
*  The DHS has identified over 400 illegal immigrants, illegal aliens, who were brought to the United [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=310.4s)]
*  States by an ISIS-affiliated human smuggling network. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=318.52s)]
*  Radical Islamic terrorists, Kamala, as the FBI director pointed out on five separate [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=322.96s)]
*  occasions, the threat of a terrorist attack has not been this high since 9-11-01. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=327.96s)]
*  Now, why the FBI director has allowed Joe and Kamala to allow the law breaking and even [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=333.2s)]
*  aid in a bet in the law breaking is, however, very unclear. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=340.16s)]
*  But terrorism is not the only deadly threat coming across our unsecured southern border. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=344.24s)]
*  Fentanyl deaths have peaked under the Biden-Harris administration, you know, taking a record [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=349.72s)]
*  number of American lives every year, violent crimes and criminals. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=354.6s)]
*  They have also poured in from around the world, including murderers, rapists. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=359.44s)]
*  They're coming from Iran and Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  They're coming from Russia. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=367.64s)]
*  They're coming from China, Venezuela. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  Look at your screen. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=370.44s)]
*  Let's look at the victims of Joe and Kamala's open borders. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=371.8s)]
*  You know, Jocelyn Nungeri, remember her? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  The 12-year-old girl, brutalized for over two hours, fought back valiantly. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  She was abducted, sexually assaulted, then brutally murdered. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=383.12s)]
*  Kamala, when will you say her name? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  When will you call her family? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=390.96s)]
*  When will you apologize? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=393.56s)]
*  An illegal immigrant from Venezuela charged with her murder. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  They came in under the Biden-Harris open border policy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=399.08000000000004s)]
*  Rachel Morin, as you know, mother of five, raped, murdered on her favorite hiking trail. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=402.92s)]
*  Kamala, when are you going to say her name? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=409.12s)]
*  When are you going to call her family? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=412.0s)]
*  When will you apologize for your failure? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  Her alleged killer, another Biden-Harris illegal immigrant who was wanted for murder in his [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  home country of El Salvador before entering the United States because of their open borders. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=423.56s)]
*  Not Lincoln, Lakin Reilly. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=429.24s)]
*  Remember her? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=431.32s)]
*  The 22-year-old nursing student, kidnapped, murdered while she was out jogging. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=432.32s)]
*  Kamala, when are you going to say her name? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=437.15999999999997s)]

*  When will you apologize for your failed policies that you still support? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  Her reported killer, a 26-year-old, the illegal immigrant from Venezuela, came in because [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  of Joe and Kamala's open borders. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=451.88000000000005s)]
*  Elizabeth Medina, 16-year-old high school cheerleader, stalked and murdered by a purported [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=454.24s)]

*  immigrant. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=468.16s)]

*  None of these murders, none of these rapes, none of these crimes should ever have happened. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=482.76s)]
*  All of these innocent fellow citizens should be alive right now, and all these other victims [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=488.32s)]
*  should never have had to endure what they have been through. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=494.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris, are you ever going to say their names? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=497.96s)]
*  Are you ever going to call their families? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  Will you ever apologize for your dereliction of duty at the border? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=503.0s)]
*  Or is Biden's border czar just going to pretend that she had nothing to do with the border [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=507.42s)]
*  crisis, all while her supporters like Elizabeth Warren go on TV, brag about mass amnesty for [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=512.54s)]
*  all of their unvetted illegal immigrants? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=519.66s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=522.38s)]
*  But recognize, and I know that Kamala Harris knows this, this is a problem that ultimately [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=523.38s)]
*  has to be solved by Congress. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=528.7s)]
*  We need the tools in order to have more resources at the border, to have more resources in the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=531.1800000000001s)]
*  states and cities that are supporting migrants. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  And, I believe, we need to create a pathway to citizenship. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=540.5s)]
*  All of that is a part of what we need to do for comprehensive immigration reform. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=544.3s)]
*  Kamala Harris will work with Congress and get that done. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=549.9799999999999s)]
*  We need more of your money to pay for illegal immigrants that didn't respect our laws, border [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=554.9399999999999s)]
*  sovereignty, to pay for their health care, their education, their housing and every other [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=559.0999999999999s)]
*  need that they may have, and then give them free citizenship. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=563.2199999999999s)]
*  You don't have to be a genius to understand the root cause of illegal immigration. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=566.4799999999999s)]
*  You just have to watch that clip. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=571.68s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=574.04s)]
*  Because illegal immigrants are coming to this country en masse because Joe Biden, Kamala [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=575.04s)]
*  Harris and their fellow Democrats, they're now promising something of immense value, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=580.0s)]
*  U.S. citizenship and health care and housing and food and education, and you pay for it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  And by the way, if Kamala Harris wins in November, it will only get worse. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=593.9s)]
*  Kamala has no problem putting you and your families and other Americans' families at [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=599.3000000000001s)]
*  risk in support of this radical, far-left political cause. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=603.9s)]
*  Just look at the Minnesota bail fund, for example. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=608.02s)]
*  Remember the tweet from 2020? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=610.7800000000001s)]
*  You know, the Summer of Love, Harris enthusiastically promoting this fund. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=613.1s)]
*  This was right during the height of the 2020 riots that they lied about and said were mostly [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=617.58s)]
*  peaceful. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=622.14s)]
*  Like they said that inflation was transitory. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=623.16s)]
*  Like they said the border was closed and secure for three years. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=625.4s)]
*  Well, those 2020 riots, only four days after that Minnesota Minneapolis police precinct [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=628.48s)]
*  was burned to the ground. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=635.08s)]
*  Four days she sent out that tweet. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=636.08s)]
*  And for the record, here's the former executive director of the bail fund explaining how the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=638.48s)]
*  program works. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=642.46s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=643.46s)]
*  I often don't even look at a charge specifics when I bail someone out. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=645.08s)]
*  I'll see it after I pay the bail because it's not the point. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=649.56s)]
*  It's just that it is not the point. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=654.3399999999999s)]
*  The point is the system that we're fighting. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=656.8199999999999s)]
*  If you're a rapist charged with murder, it's not the point. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=659.02s)]
*  We got to get you out of jail and you become a threat to the rest of society. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=663.6199999999999s)]
*  Now because of the support from Kamala Harris, other Democrats, that bail fund, they went [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=668.06s)]
*  from about a quarter of a million dollars a year to over 40 plus million dollars bailing [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=673.1s)]
*  out incredibly dangerous people and letting them free among the American people. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=680.28s)]
*  That includes, let's take a look at some of the people, shall we? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=685.82s)]
*  George Howard bailed out of jail during a domestic assault case. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=688.78s)]
*  While he was out on bond, well, he didn't look at what the charges were. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=692.52s)]
*  The guy shot and killed the man during a road rage incident. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=696.9s)]
*  The Minnesota bail fund paid $350,000 in cash to bail out a twice convicted rapist [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=700.06s)]
*  after he was charged with kidnapping, assault, sexual assault and two different cases. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=706.18s)]
*  The fund also bailed out a career criminal named Shawn Michael Tillman who shot and killed [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=711.6199999999999s)]
*  a commuter in St. Paul after bail was posted. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=717.5799999999999s)]
*  Darnica Floyd also bailed out $100,000 in cash from the Minnesota bail fund after allegedly [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=721.54s)]
*  stabbing someone to death. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=728.22s)]
*  Why would Kamala Harris support any fund like this? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=730.58s)]
*  Well, because she's a radical. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=733.9399999999999s)]
*  Her views perfectly align with members of the radical socialist squad that now represents [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=736.06s)]
*  the new modern leftist Marxist Democratic Party. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=743.22s)]
*  And frankly, Kamala is the leader of the New Green Deal movement. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=746.86s)]
*  Here's Kamala in her own words. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=750.9399999999999s)]
*  You decide. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=753.02s)]
*  How's the state going to be better if you're the attorney general and not Mr. Cooley? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=754.22s)]
*  Well, I know that I read that at the Republican convention he called me a radical. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=758.6999999999999s)]
*  So I guess that's one difference between us. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=763.86s)]
*  And yeah, I am radical. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=766.34s)]
*  I do believe that we need to get radical about what we are doing and take it seriously. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=768.38s)]
*  This giggling thing has gone on a long time. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=774.3s)]
*  Need more evidence of Kamala's radical views? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=776.9s)]
*  Get this. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=779.14s)]
*  Kamala has repeatedly praised her own pastor who blamed America for 9-11-01. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=780.18s)]
*  Gee, does that sound familiar? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=787.26s)]
*  And here she is talking about climate anxiety in young people. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=790.9399999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=794.62s)]
*  Young people said, we're not leaving it to other people to decide how we're dealing with [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=795.62s)]
*  the climate crisis. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=800.46s)]
*  You know, I've heard young leaders talk with me about a term they've coined called climate [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=802.46s)]
*  anxiety. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=807.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=808.02s)]
*  Which is fear of the future and the unknown, of whether it makes sense for you to even [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=809.9s)]
*  think about having children, whether it makes sense for you to think about aspiring to buy [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=815.6999999999999s)]
*  a home, because what will this climate be? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=819.54s)]
*  So my question tonight is anybody in the state of Rum Media mob, are they ever going to ask [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=823.22s)]
*  Harris about her extreme views? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=827.78s)]
*  I would predict the answer is no. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=829.78s)]
*  98 days is election day. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=832.62s)]
*  Early voting starts in about 48 days. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=834.62s)]
*  Will she ever be held accountable? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=837.42s)]
*  Don't hold your breath. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=839.42s)]
*  We will hold her accountable. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=841.14s)]
*  And hopefully you will share this information that the media will not give you with your [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=842.92s)]
*  friends and your family and your coworkers when the topic of how important this moment [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=848.3399999999999s)]
*  is for our country, because it's an inflection point. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=854.04s)]
*  We've said many elections are tipping point elections. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=857.6999999999999s)]
*  This is the inflection tipping point election of all time. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbfhMh9tnM&t=860.28s)]
