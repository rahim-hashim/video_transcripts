# Newt Gingrich: The left cannot defend this
**Fox News:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM)
*  All right, following up on his promise to solve the border crisis, earlier today, President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=0.0s)]
* -elect Donald Trump confirmed he would use the military for mass deportations of illegal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=6.42s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  But, predictably, Democrats, they are already pushing back on his deportation plan. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  Now, this weekend, incoming Trump administration border czar Tom Homan was asked about the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=17.66s)]
*  Congressional Hispanic Caucus chair, saying that his group would oppose mass deportation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=22.84s)]
*  Well, it prompted this response. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=29.7s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=31.459999999999997s)]
*  Game on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=32.46s)]
*  Look, you're a member of Congress. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=33.46s)]
*  Oh, he's just not making this up. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=35.18s)]
*  They're enforcing the law. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=36.98s)]
*  We're in a situation now, you've got members of Congress. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=37.98s)]
*  Those who enforce the law are the bad guys, and those who break the law are the victims? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=41.14s)]
*  I mean, the whole world's upside down. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=45.099999999999994s)]
*  President Trump has made it clear. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=47.46s)]
*  We're going to concentrate on public safety threats and national security threats. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=48.46s)]
*  What member of Congress, what governor, or what mayor is against taking public safety [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=52.26s)]
*  threats out of their community? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  But it is not just Democrats in Congress. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=59.1s)]
*  Democratic leaders around the country, they are threatening not to comply with Donald [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=62.34s)]
*  Trump's mass deportations. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=65.62s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=67.22s)]
*  We're going to defend the people of this city. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=68.22s)]
*  Because look, his attack, let's be very clear, the president-elect, former President Trump, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=71.7s)]
*  his threat is not just towards new arrivals and undocumented families. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  His threats are also against black families. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=84.16s)]
*  If the Trump administration requests it, would the Massachusetts state police assist [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=86.9s)]
*  in mass deportations? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=92.9s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=94.9s)]
*  I have a message. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=98.94000000000001s)]
*  They won't have any choice. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=100.10000000000001s)]
*  That would be federal jurisdiction. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=102.38000000000001s)]
*  Now, I guess that means they don't have a problem with dozens of dead Americans, Americans [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  killed by Harris Biden, unvetted, illegals, or the dozens of Americans raped, including [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=110.58000000000001s)]
*  children, or the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Americans that have been victims [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  of violent crime, or they don't seem to care about known gang members in the country, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  cartel members in the country, known terrorists. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  We know there are people who would terrorize in this country right now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  We just don't know where they are. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=133.7s)]
*  Or they don't care about the Lake and Riley trial that is now ongoing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=135.29999999999998s)]
*  Or even more disturbing details came to light today. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=139.82s)]
*  And according to sources, the alleged murderer, Jose Ibarra, took one of the free Biden administration-funded [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=143.06s)]
*  flights to Georgia from New York, where the—he then hunted down Lake and Riley. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, should these people not be deported? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=155.94s)]
*  Why would you—why would you put the lives of illegal immigrant criminals over the safety [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=159.1s)]
*  of Americans? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=165.22s)]
*  And during today's trial, his roommate told the court that Ibarra was in bed, sound asleep [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=166.7s)]
*  shortly after the alleged murder. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=172.34s)]
*  And an FBI employee testified in court today that during a jailhouse call, Ibarra's wife [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=174.44s)]
*  appeared to accuse him of knowing about Lake and Riley's murder, asking him, quote, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=179.26s)]
*  "'What happened to that girl?'' [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=183.78s)]
*  Now, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris should be tried, frankly, for what they have done to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=185.34s)]
*  aid and abet in all of this lawbreaking with wide-open borders, free transportation, free [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=190.44s)]
*  care, education, and Kamala, of course, supporting free sex change or taxpayer-funded sex change [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=197.82s)]
*  operations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=203.78s)]
*  But I don't support the weaponization of justice like they do." [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=205.62s)]
*  Here with reaction, former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=209.9s)]
*  I'm just having a hard time understanding, you know, what part of the murder, rape, drugs, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=214.14s)]
*  violence, gangs, cartels, why are they defending those people over the safety of American citizens? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  Can you explain that to me? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  Because I'm having a hard time understanding it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=232.82000000000002s)]
*  There's a psychological phenomenon called cognitive dissonance. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=233.82000000000002s)]
*  And in cognitive dissonance, you simply reject information you don't want. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=240.78s)]
*  So for example, if you really love chocolate ice cream, you convince yourself that it has [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=245.46s)]
*  no calories, and so you can eat all the chocolate ice cream you want. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  You're dealing with people who have, over the last 60 years, developed an anti-American [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=254.54s)]
*  model, used it to dominate the major universities, then to dominate the newsrooms, then to infiltrate [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=262.82s)]
*  the bureaucracies. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=270.98s)]
*  And these people have clear models. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  They're very anti-American. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=274.5s)]
*  They want a weaker America. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=276.26s)]
*  They want to drown those of us who represent traditional America with people who have no [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=278.14000000000004s)]
*  idea what America is all about. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=283.3s)]
*  And they're very militant about it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=285.54s)]
*  And so they start from that perspective. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=288.18s)]
*  President Trump has a simple challenge. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=291.3s)]
*  The American people will rally if you start methodically with criminals, with people who [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=293.62s)]
*  came out of jails. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=301.14000000000004s)]
*  The first 600,000 or a million that you're going to deport are pretty obvious and very [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=303.9s)]
*  hard to argue against. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=309.86s)]
*  And what you want to do is crowd the people who are nuts into defending, you know, let's [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=311.74s)]
*  keep the rapists in town. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=317.7s)]
*  Let's keep the murderers in town. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=319.54s)]
*  They can't defend that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=321.42s)]
*  That just makes them look silly and isolated. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=322.82s)]
*  You know, I remember I had a front row seat. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=326.14s)]
*  I got to MC the night you became speaker. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=329.46s)]
*  I would argue that in my lifetime there have been three waves of real conservative change [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=332.82s)]
*  in this country. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=338.34s)]
*  The first would be Ronald Reagan. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=339.34s)]
*  The second would be the Gingrich revolution. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=341.34s)]
*  Before you even became speaker, Time and Newsweek had some version of the Gingrich that stole [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=344.38s)]
*  Christmas and broke Tiny Tim's crutch. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=349.9s)]
*  Before you even got it done. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=353.14s)]
*  And you said at the time, I am a genuine revolutionary. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  That's what you said. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if you recall that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  You did say it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=362.3s)]
*  And by the time you left being speaker, you balanced the budget four times in a row. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=363.3s)]
*  And it's the last time in history it's been balanced. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=370.38s)]
*  Now we have a chance to actually do what conservatives often say they want to do. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=373.94s)]
*  How does Trump get to the point where he will be successful? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=378.5s)]
*  He has to every day follow Lincoln, Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  The American people have to be his allies. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=393.14s)]
*  Not just communications. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=396.54s)]
*  He has to work with them. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=397.94s)]
*  He has to arouse them. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=399.46000000000004s)]
*  He has to organize them. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=401.08s)]
*  Look, people don't even realize this, but under President Eisenhower, we deported about [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  a million five hundred thousand people, which for the population of the United States at [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=407.5s)]
*  that time would be a deportation today, probably of around seven or eight million people. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=411.62s)]
*  So we have a history of doing this. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=416.7s)]
*  We know how to do this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=418.54s)]
*  And I think but I think on every issue, whether it's the tax cuts, regulatory reform, this [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=420.42s)]
*  new commission, the Doge Commission on cutting out spending, or it's controlling the border [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=425.38s)]
*  and getting people out of this country who are dangerous on every issue. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=432.42s)]
*  The number one job of the Trump administration is to work with the American people. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=436.94s)]
*  Reagan used to say it perfectly. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=442.58s)]
*  His job was to turn up the light for the American people so they would turn up the heat on Congress. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=444.38s)]
*  The only way you win this fight is to win the public relations side. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=450.06s)]
*  Margaret Thatcher said once, first you win the argument, then you win the vote. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azwd7vZn_GM&t=454.94s)]
