# Republicans today stand for ‘victory’: Vivek Ramaswamy
**Fox News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4)
*  So effective here with reaction is the former GOP presidential candidate probably soon to be governor from Ohio [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=0.0s)]
*  He's going to announce tonight right here on this show the vague Ramaswami is with us, sir. How are you? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=6.98s)]
*  Good to see you Sean [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=13.18s)]
*  You are free to do so if you want just saying all right, so [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=15.22s)]
*  We'll have more to say but thank you, man [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=19.62s)]
*  You're very welcome. I'm always here to help [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  So most Democrats are just shrieking they're just utter hysteria and somehow the sky is falling [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=25.2s)]
*  I kind of like the Obama guys and their comments the best and Carvel's comments the best [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=32.92s)]
*  No, the Cavalry is not coming [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=38.12s)]
*  Republicans are actually on board with cutting waste fraud [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=40.76s)]
*  abuse and corruption and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=44.92s)]
*  The Obama guy is saying why didn't we do that is kind of revealing but there there are not many of those voices left [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=47.2s)]
*  Look, here's my breakdown of what's happened in the Democratic Party Sean [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=54.74s)]
*  There are effectively two parties within the Democrat Party on one hand. You have the woke identity politics left [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  It's all about race gender sexuality and climate change and what happened is they gained a chokehold on their party [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=66.2s)]
*  Away from the wing that wanted to focus on economic redistribution [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  Economic inequality frankly you and I would disagree with both of those wings [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=77.4s)]
*  But the latter is at least more reasonable is at least more clear-headed and so what I hope for the sake of the country [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=81.42s)]
*  Is at least that wing of the Democratic Party reemerges to make a better version, you know [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=87.02s)]
*  I think it's probably divided about evenly in the Democratic Party [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  That's what I would say no other other wing the woke we gained the control. They're the ones that gained the control [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=94.34s)]
*  You might be right about that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=100.66s)]
*  That's not our problem that's what's going on over there [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=103.7s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's 50-50 though, I mean I always respect your view [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=107.22s)]
*  I think it's taking over the party like a cancer and it's like 95% you have a few voices Axelrod [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=111.46s)]
*  You know Carvel Rahm Emanuel the Obama guys on on radio Dean Phillips [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  But the rest of the party is shrieking. They're flipping out, you know angry raging at all times. I [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=124.3s)]
*  I [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=132.76s)]
*  Think you are right about one thing Sean is when you're talking about the elite voices or so-called elite voices that appear on television [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=133.7s)]
*  Or even those in elected office [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=139.42s)]
*  I think you're right when you're talking about everyday citizens across the country even those who used to identify [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=141.22s)]
*  With the Bill Clinton Democratic Party, maybe it's closer to a more even split either way. That's not your my problem to solve [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  That's their issue to address but that's the real war for the future of the Democratic Party [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  Here's I think our way forward as a country is that we have to take their attitude of victimhood [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=157.55999999999997s)]
*  That's what's defined the modern Democratic Party is this culture of victimhood just reject that and say we are victors as Americans [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  That's what the Republican Party today stands for victory [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=169.27999999999997s)]
*  Not victimhood more winning less whining and I think that's inspiring more people to say we're not just running from something [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=172.44s)]
*  We're now running back to our vision of the American dream something. We don't talk about enough anymore [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=179.44s)]
*  But we're gonna start talking about more which is the idea that we want a country where everybody even the Democrats are able to live [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=184.82000000000002s)]
*  A better life through their own hard work and dedication rather than wallowing in victimhood [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=191.62s)]
*  That's the America that Donald Trump is leading us to and that's what I'm excited about for what's ahead [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  Before kind of moving on to this next chapter, which I believe will be run for the governorship in in, Ohio [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=201.74s)]
*  Before that you you were with Doge you were there at the beginning you were there at the foundation [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=209.58s)]
*  And so they're finding, you know tens and tens of billions of dollars and in all of this foreign money [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=213.72s)]
*  All of it's spent on radical Green New Deal programs woke ism transgender ism [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=219.8s)]
*  LGBTQ ism, etc, etc. This is not benefiting the American people [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=226.68s)]
*  Does that wing of the Democratic Party whether your percentage is right or my percentage doesn't matter [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  Do they really think this is a winning issue for them? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  I [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  Certainly hope not because most Americans are against bureaucracy most Americans are against the red tape [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=244.44000000000003s)]
*  The biggest myth in America over much of the last two decades is the people we elect to run the government [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=249.72000000000003s)]
*  They're not actually the ones who have even been running the government [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  It is this unelected bureaucracy in this fourth branch of government that would make our founding fathers [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=258.22s)]
*  Rollover in their grave and so to be able to say that we're getting rid of that bureaucracy [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=264.16s)]
*  Cutting cost putting money back in the hands of taxpayers. That's what our founding fathers actually envisioned [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=268.7s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump wants to revive [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=274.7s)]
*  That's what Doge was formed to do and I'm proud to help get that off the ground to now see that actually restore [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  Not just savings for the taxpayer. That's important Sean, but it's about reviving our founding culture where you have a government [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=283.1s)]
*  That's actually accountable to its people rather than the other way around and this idea that somehow [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=289.26s)]
*  It's impossible to close two trillion dollars out of the federal deficit. That's nonsense in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=294.88s)]
*  2019 we spent two and a half trillion dollars less than we do right now [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=299.56s)]
*  2019 wasn't some ancient period back in the ice age. That was five years ago six years ago [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  We can get back to that. I think most Americans agree with that and whether the Democratic elites agree or not. That's the hard truth [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=309.36s)]
*  And you know what Americans? I think they prefer more money for their kids in school lower taxes [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=315.48s)]
*  Secure borders law and order in their town and city. It's kind of fundamental take care of the American people first and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=322.82s)]
*  And the American people have been frankly abused in this process and they've stolen from them their kids and their grandkids [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=329.61999999999995s)]
*  Vivek when you're ready to announce we're ready to we're ready to have you back. Thank you for being with us [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  All right, we come back [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=341.78s)]
*  You [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKasuJNUwa4&t=351.84s)]
