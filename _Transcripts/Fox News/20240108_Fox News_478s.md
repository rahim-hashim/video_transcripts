# Hannity: The Obamas are getting ‘very, very nervous’
**Fox News:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww)
*  And welcome to this special edition of Hannity Countdown to Iowa, the 2024 presidential election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=0.0s)]
*  It will kick off in exactly one week from tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=6.48s)]
*  We should have full results from the Republican Iowa caucus next Monday, but don't expect [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=9.72s)]
*  any numbers from Democrats. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=14.8s)]
*  With a very complicated mail-in voting system and the reshuffling of the Democratic Party's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=16.72s)]
*  primary calendar, we won't get an official tally for months. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=21.76s)]
*  Of course, barring a major trip in fall, Biden will almost certainly be the Democratic nominee. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  The big question tonight, why? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden's been a terrible president. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=33.96s)]
*  His approval numbers show it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=35.7s)]
*  They're at record lows. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=36.96s)]
*  His cabinet doesn't even bother to keep him in the loop on major issues. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  No one even bothered to tell your president, Joey Biden, that his secretary of defense [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=42.24s)]
*  was actually incapacitated in the ICU for several days. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=47.18000000000001s)]
*  I was wondering out loud, what if we had a national emergency or some international crisis [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=52.64s)]
*  and we need our secretary of defense? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  We don't know where he is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=60.540000000000006s)]
*  Now, I guess it wasn't a concern for the administration, since Biden pretty much sleeps, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=61.540000000000006s)]
*  eats and takes vacations. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=66.28s)]
*  Occasionally he'll travel somewhere close to the White House for a short speech delivered [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=68.08s)]
*  from a teleprompter with giant font. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=72.30000000000001s)]
*  He's frail. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=75.64s)]
*  He's weak. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=76.64s)]
*  He's incompetent. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=77.64s)]
*  He's so frail that now his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, is helping the president manage his [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=78.72s)]
*  daily schedule. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=83.08s)]
*  And this week, Jill Biden is actually sitting down for an upcoming interview on Joe's behalf. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=84.5s)]
*  And now lately, more often than not, the first lady also has, literally has to help her husband, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=90.34s)]
*  you know, very dazed and confused, walk off a stage after a rare speaking event. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=95.84s)]
*  We saw this on Friday after Biden's big, I hate Donald Trump. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=102.16s)]
*  I'll repeat it for the next 11 months campaign kickoff near Valley Forge. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=106.44s)]
*  Now, the Biden campaign was trying to use his historic location to draw comparisons [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=111.0s)]
*  to George Washington. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=116.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=117.48s)]
*  Instead, Biden resembled a bitter, angry, aging, well-confused and dazed politician [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=118.48s)]
*  desperately clinging to power. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=124.92s)]
*  He, as per usual, demonized MAGA Republicans for the 4 millionth time, obsessed over January [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=127.4s)]
*  6th for the 5th millionth time, and even bragged about throwing certain rioters in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=132.96s)]
*  jail. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=137.36s)]
*  Of course, he had nothing but praise for the violent looters and rioters and arsonists. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=138.36s)]
*  And in some cases, two dozen Americans died and thousands of cops were injured in the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=144.36s)]
*  summer of 2020. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=148.12s)]
*  Remember, those were peaceful riots that his own vice president tweeted out a bail [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=149.56s)]
*  fund link for for the perpetrators in the Minneapolis case after the police precinct [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  there was burned to the ground. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  It was so nice of her. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  We didn't have a commission for the 574 riots in the summer of 2020. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=163.0s)]
*  Why didn't we have a commission for that? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  We had a couple of dozen dead Americans. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  We had billions of property damaged, cops pelted with bricks, rocks, bottles, Molotov [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  cocktails, 2,000-plus cops injured. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=176.76s)]
*  No investigative anything? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=179.92s)]
*  Nothing? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=182.0s)]
*  No arrests? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=183.0s)]
*  We have all the evidence. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=184.0s)]
*  Why aren't we arresting those people? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=185.0s)]
*  Now, sadly today, more on the same vitriol in South Carolina, where Biden used the site [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=186.48s)]
*  of a horrific 2015 mass shooting to further vilify his political opponents. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=191.56s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, the Biden campaign, all they have to sell is fear, hatred and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=196.16s)]
*  loathing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=203.2s)]
*  That's all they have. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=204.2s)]
*  They have nothing else to offer. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=205.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign is about him, not America, not you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=215.28s)]
*  Trump's assault on democracy isn't just part of his past. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  It's what he's promising for the future. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=224.08s)]
*  He's being straightforward. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=225.96s)]
*  He's not hiding the ball. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=227.96s)]
*  Trump's not concerned about your future, I promise you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=229.88s)]
*  Trump is now promising a full-scale campaign of revenge and retribution. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  The same movement that throughout the mob, the United States Capitol isn't just trying [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=238.96s)]
*  history, January 6th, they're trying to determine to erase history and your future. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=245.54s)]
*  Banning books, denying your right to vote and have it counted, destroying diversity, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=252.54s)]
*  equality, inclusion all across America, harboring hate and replacing hope with anger and resentment. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  Democracy in peril. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=268.53999999999996s)]
*  Trump, MAGA Republicans, January 6th, abortion, identity politics, fear mongering, that's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=271.14s)]
*  all you're going to hear from the Democratic Party and their surrogates and their willing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=277.74s)]
*  accomplices in the media mob from now until Election Day in November. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=282.86s)]
*  Biden has given up on his fake pledge to fight for the soul of our nation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=287.26s)]
*  Instead, he's looking to divide and conquer. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=291.53999999999996s)]
*  He's actually adopted the Eric Holder strategy of they go low, kick them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  That's his style of campaigning, or at least that's what the Democratic Party's trying [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=299.54s)]
*  to do. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=303.3s)]
*  Now, Joe barely knows what day of the week it actually is and will spend most of the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=304.3s)]
*  upcoming year in his basement or in the White House basement or on the beach somewhere resting [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=308.58000000000004s)]
*  and relaxing. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=313.22s)]
*  But so far, it's not working for Joe Biden. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=314.48s)]
*  Voters remain angry at their president. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=318.26s)]
*  Look at these polls. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=321.02000000000004s)]
*  The president is down in nearly every single swing state in the country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=322.02000000000004s)]
*  Trump haters in America are reportedly freaking out. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=326.86s)]
*  That would be former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=329.94s)]
*  They apparently are getting very, very nervous, according to The Washington Post. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  During a meeting at the White House, quote, Obama grew animated discussing the 2024 election [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=338.82s)]
*  and the former president. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=344.38s)]
*  Donald Trump's potential return to power scares him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  And meanwhile, Michelle Obama expressed her fears on a recent podcast. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=350.58000000000004s)]
*  Take a look for yourself. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=354.74s)]
*  It's going to happen in this next election. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=355.74s)]
*  I am terrified about what could possibly happen because our leaders matter. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=358.1s)]
*  Who we select, who speaks for us, who holds that bully pulpit. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=363.78000000000003s)]
*  It affects us in ways that sometimes I think people take for granted. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=369.22s)]
*  The fact that people think that government, eh, you know, doesn't really even do anything. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=373.62s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God, does government do everything for us? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=379.82s)]
*  And we cannot take this democracy for granted. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=384.22s)]
*  And I took her at her word for the first time in her adult life. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=387.94000000000005s)]
*  She actually was proud of her country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=390.70000000000005s)]
*  What happened? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=392.22s)]
*  Now, the government does everything for us? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=393.22s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=395.70000000000005s)]
*  Now, the Obamas are completely out of touch. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=396.70000000000005s)]
*  We know that, but they are right to worry about Joe Biden's political chances. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=398.70000000000005s)]
*  The Biden White House has mismanaged pretty much everything. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=402.82000000000005s)]
*  The Afghanistan withdrawal, the disaster that is our border, the attacks in the Middle East, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=405.8s)]
*  war in Europe, Bidenomics, inflation. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  Is there anything that's going well? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=413.62s)]
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=415.14s)]
*  What drives elections? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=418.02s)]
*  Peace and prosperity? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=419.26s)]
*  Okay, well, the world's not so peaceful. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=420.26s)]
*  Joe Biden's getting bullied by China, Russia, Iran, and seemingly everybody else. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvqjgyG8Ww&t=422.9s)]
