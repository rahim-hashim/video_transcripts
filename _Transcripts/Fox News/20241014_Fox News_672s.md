# Sean Hannity: The panic on the left is palpable
**Fox News:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight we are only 22 days away from the election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=0.0s)]
*  The panic on the left is palpable. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=6.94s)]
*  The poll numbers are not good for Kamala Harris. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=9.44s)]
*  However, I urge every voter to assume that your sole vote will decide this election. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=12.08s)]
*  In other words, take nothing for granted. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=18.44s)]
*  But now, in a last-ditch effort to win over voters, the Harris campaign is getting very [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=20.98s)]
*  interesting. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=25.96s)]
*  We are carrying out two very desperate measures. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=26.96s)]
*  One, the first, includes more public events for the Democratic candidate who's been in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  hiding for 84 days. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=34.08s)]
*  And as you can imagine, it is not going well at all. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=35.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=39.32s)]
*  You know, there's this whole, I talked with somebody once who said, you know, if you just [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=40.32s)]
*  look at where the stars are in the sky, don't look at them as just random things. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=44.8s)]
*  If you just look at them as points, look at the constellation, what does it show you? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=51.96s)]
*  So you just outlined it, Roland. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=56.84s)]
*  What does it show you? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  That the cities that he picks on in terms of black population or black mayor are both. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=61.14s)]
*  Stars in the sky, beautiful. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's state the obvious. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=73.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a terrible candidate. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=74.12s)]
*  Her running mate, well, is just as bad, if not worse. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=75.98s)]
*  She does not connect with voters, especially without a teleprompter. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  That is why Kamala has been in hiding. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  That is why her surrogates are so important to her campaign. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  Now this brings us to the second desperate measure that the Harris campaign is now employing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=90.48s)]
*  here, a full core press featuring all of Kamala Harris's top allies. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=96.92s)]
*  But so far, that strategy has been a disaster. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=102.12s)]
*  First, campaign co-chair Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  She had to finally apologize for that bizarre video that many believe was a cheap attempt [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  at mocking Holy Communion. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=115.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=118.0s)]
*  And then Whitmer spent the next several days claiming, no, this was merely a promotion [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=127.0s)]
*  for semiconductor chips and now has finally been forced to apologize for offending Catholics [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=131.72s)]
*  and other Christians and at the same time another Harris surrogate, Barack Obama. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=138.24s)]
*  It didn't look like he really wanted to be in Pennsylvania before the speech. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=143.4s)]
*  He only seemed to enjoy bashing Trump, which is the left's obsession. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=146.84s)]
*  And there he was scolding African American men, even accusing them of sexism. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm speaking to men directly. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  as president. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  And you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, maybe you're against women. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Those condescending remarks were not received well at all. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=200.6s)]
*  Far-left activist Nina Turner even accused Obama of, quote, blaming black men for the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=203.6s)]
*  Democratic Party's failures. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=209.12s)]
*  The very liberal New York Magazine calling it, quote, Barack Obama's tiresome condescension [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  towards black men. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=216.92s)]
*  An op-ed in the Washington Post referred to Obama as the scolder in chief and advised the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=218.48s)]
*  Harris campaign to, quote, steer clear of Obama's instinct for, quote, tough love. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=225.12s)]
*  So after a heavy dose of judgment from the former president, in this case Obama, well, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=231.12s)]
*  the Harris campaign continues with more surrogates but equally insulting tactics. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=236.12s)]
*  Harris is now promising, you know, a handout and cold hard cash up to 20 grand in forgivable [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=241.12s)]
*  loan forgiveness loans that are only available to black entrepreneurs that they would be [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=249.12s)]
*  the only ones able or eligible to receive it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=255.64s)]
*  She, remember, also wants to pay off student loans, and she's vowing to help African Americans [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=257.64s)]
*  invest in cryptocurrency. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=262.64s)]
*  And she's calling for marijuana to be legalized. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=265.4s)]
*  But when you, you know, think of the pandering and you think you can't get any worse, you [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=268.7s)]
*  know, well, think back. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=273.48s)]
*  She wants to—is this kind of like a vote-buying scheme when you want to pay off student loans [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=274.82s)]
*  that you call stupid? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=280.16s)]
*  Or is it $25,000 down payments for your first home or $50,000 for other businesses? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=281.84s)]
*  Or what about her running mate, Tim Walz, trying to win over male voters with sports [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=288.68s)]
*  and guns? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=294.08s)]
*  Because on Friday during a quick trip to a high school football game, you know, where [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=295.08s)]
*  Walz was a assistant volunteer coach that kind of claimed he was the coach, was—he [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=299.6s)]
*  was almost ignored by the entire crowd. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=306.08s)]
*  They gave him the silent treatment. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  And then on Saturday, Walz, he wanted to, you know, show the world what a big Second [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  Amendment guy he was, and he brought out a shotgun, and he went pheasant hunting. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=315.82s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala, she wants mandatory gun buyback. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=320.64s)]
*  Some might call it confiscation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, this was also a disaster for Walz. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=326.64s)]
*  He didn't seem to know how to load his own gun. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=329.84s)]
*  You decide. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  That's quite scary, and it never fits quite right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  It's not quite right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=337.68s)]
*  How do you give it that? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=338.68s)]
*  Governor, what kind of gun is it? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=339.68s)]
*  This is a Beretta A400. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=342.68s)]
*  I brought—I bought it when I was shooting a lot of trap because it has a kind of their [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=346.44s)]
*  patented thing, a kickoff. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  So when you get old, it doesn't hurt your shoulder as much. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  It's probably been 15 years since I pulled that sucker out. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=357.64000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, of course, this trip wasn't all about guns and hunting. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  Walz also trying to connect with his fellow guy, you know, pounding down a Diet Mountain [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  Dew. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=370.56s)]
*  I prefer regular. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=371.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=372.56s)]
*  No, pan in. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=373.56s)]
*  Pan pan. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=374.56s)]
*  That's why it's hunting, not shooting, right? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=375.56s)]
*  You knew it, didn't you, man? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=379.88000000000005s)]
*  And I'm going to grab a Diet Mountain Dew if we got one. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to pound one down. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=385.56s)]
*  Now, if you think that Walz is bad, just waiting to hear about the next campaign surrogate. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=386.56s)]
*  I'm not going to make this up either. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=393.4s)]
*  In another desperate attempt to win over men, the Harris campaign turned to Bill Clinton. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=394.4s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=398.8s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=399.8s)]
*  Slick Willie. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=400.8s)]
*  I'm back all by myself. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=401.8s)]
*  Hillary's on vacation. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=402.8s)]
*  Unfortunately, Slick Willie is not as slick as he used to be. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=403.8s)]
*  And today, when trying to blame Trump for the border crisis, which was secure when they [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=407.64s)]
*  inherited it and they bragged about for three years the border being closed, the border [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=412.64s)]
*  being secure, and bragging about undoing all the Trump border policies that brought us [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=416.96s)]
*  the lowest level of illegal immigration in decades. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=421.88000000000005s)]
*  Bill Clinton, unfortunately, kind of indicted the border czar, Kamala Harris, for not vetting [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=425.36s)]
*  the 12-plus million Harris-Biden illegals from over 180 countries. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  And Clinton says, oh, no, no, I was taken out of context. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=437.86s)]
*  But as always, we report, you decide. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=444.0s)]
*  Listen to what he says about late July. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=445.0s)]
*  Trump killed the bill. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=446.0s)]
*  The bill was written, being written, by senior Republicans in the Senate. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=448.4s)]
*  And he killed the bill. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=455.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=457.08s)]
*  You had a case in Georgia not very long ago, didn't you? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=458.08s)]
*  They made an ad about a young woman who'd been killed by an immigrant. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=461.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=466.88s)]
*  But if they all properly vetted, and that doesn't happen, and America is not having [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=473.3s)]
*  enough babies to keep our populations up, so we need immigrants that have been vetted [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=479.62s)]
*  to do work, there wouldn't be a problem. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=484.98s)]
*  And he couldn't keep people all torn up and upset. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=490.98s)]
*  The bill was not a border security bill. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=494.68s)]
*  It wouldn't have even kicked in unless four or five thousand illegals first crossed into [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=497.54s)]
*  the country illegally. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=501.44s)]
*  And then they had the discretion of whether or not they would actually enforce the bill, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=503.66s)]
*  codifying their open borders policies. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=508.46000000000004s)]
*  He's not telling the truth. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=510.74s)]
*  An unvetted, Harris Biden, illegal immigrant is accused of murdering Lakin Reilly the same [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=512.34s)]
*  month that the Democrats' so-called border bill was voted down in the Senate. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=518.46s)]
*  So nice try. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=523.78s)]
*  That bill wouldn't do a thing to secure the border, which they lied about and were telling [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=525.54s)]
*  us for three plus years was secure, secure and closed. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  Instead, Harris and Biden, they wanted to use this phony border security bill to hire [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=534.76s)]
*  judges and bureaucrats to process their unvetted illegal immigrants into the country faster. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=538.9599999999999s)]
*  Now, this was after more than 12 million already had poured into our country. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  And while Harris, you know, the borders are, looked on, did nothing, lied to the American [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=549.68s)]
*  people, said the border is secure. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  Thousands of convicted murderers, rapists, felons. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=557.24s)]
*  Now we have known terrorists in our country. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=560.24s)]
*  We don't know where they are, but we know they have terror ties, all because Joe and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=562.4s)]
*  Kamala got rid of Trump's successful border protections and they did it with a stroke [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  of a pen on day one. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=571.58s)]
*  They didn't need a bill in the first place. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=572.94s)]
*  And that's why Trump just received a unanimous endorsement from the Border Patrol Union and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=575.08s)]
*  Kamala Harris didn't. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=580.64s)]
*  These are the people who see what has been going on firsthand. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=582.52s)]
*  And now as we approach a very important election, responsible state governors like Glenn Youngkin, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=586.68s)]
*  the Commonwealth of Virginia, they have taken measures to clean illegal immigrants, non-citizens [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=592.4s)]

*  In doing so, Glenn Youngkin was enforcing a bill signed into law in 2006 by then governor, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=602.52s)]
*  Democrat Tim Kaine, you know, the guy that ran for vice president, requiring the state [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=611.28s)]
*  to maintain the Commonwealth of Virginia's voter rolls. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=616.56s)]
*  But in a bizarre, crazy, insane twist, well, the Harris-Biden pro-illegal immigrant administration, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=620.92s)]
*  you know, that now suddenly seems to care about border security, they're suing the Commonwealth [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=628.1199999999999s)]
*  of Virginia, the state of Virginia, to keep those illegal immigrants on the voter rolls. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  And by the way, you need picture ID to get into the Democratic convention. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=639.26s)]
*  I know because I went there. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=643.28s)]
*  I know it was a heavy lift. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=644.56s)]
*  You need picture ID to get into a presidential or vice presidential debate or the White House. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=646.8s)]
*  Why not voting? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=653.0799999999999s)]
*  Why are Democrats against voter ID, signature verification, proof of citizenship? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s&t=654.0799999999999s)]
