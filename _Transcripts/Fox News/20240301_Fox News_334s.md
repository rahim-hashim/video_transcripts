# Trump to Hannity: This is 'something I've never seen before'
**Fox News:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8)
*  This is the razor wire. Now if we go back, all the country was watching the mass migration right in this sector, right here, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=0.0s)]
*  and you did the job that the federal government should do, and that is you put all this up. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=9.0s)]
*  Now if you go all the way down that line, you can see just how extensive it is, and you put the containers in, and 99% reduction? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=15.0s)]
*  Exactly. So right where we're looking, there used to be 3 to 5,000 people crossing here a day. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=22.0s)]
*  A day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=28.0s)]
*  But now you see there's no way anybody can cross here. From this to the containers, and now we have about an average of 7 people crossing a day, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=29.0s)]
*  and if they make it across, they are arrested by the Texas Department of Public Safety. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=37.0s)]
*  You knew then that this could be fixed. You put all these policies in place. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=41.0s)]
*  Joe Biden rescinded them with a stroke of a pen in the first hundred days, and then told us for three years the border is secure and the border is closed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=46.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=53.0s)]
*  Does that anger you? Because that angers me. I don't like to be lied to. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=54.0s)]
*  Well, I really don't think he knows what he's even talking about, to be honest with you, but I did put it, we built 571 miles of wall. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=56.0s)]
*  We worked very closely with the governor. Always had a great relationship. We worked together after the election. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=63.0s)]
*  What happened is the governor kept moving, and he did some of the whole thing with the wire, and it's pretty tough stuff. I would say it's pretty tough stuff. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=68.0s)]
*  But should the governor of the state, should he be, it's not his responsibility? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=77.0s)]
*  No, it should be the government. We were moving down into this area. We did such a job, 571 miles. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=81.0s)]
*  Now, you've got to remember, we were talking about this. I said, what's more effective? The wall is always going to be the most effective. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=87.0s)]
*  And because this you can cut, and they find ways to get through it, believe it or not. Hard to believe, but they get through it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=94.0s)]
*  Even triple layers of it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=99.0s)]
*  Yeah, but we worked very closely with Texas, and it was a great relationship and a great partnership. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=101.0s)]
*  Arizona's not doing their job with their governor, and Governor Newscombe, your friend, is not doing his job. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=105.0s)]
*  All of this was so preventable. The first hundred days, every policy you had was rescinded. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=111.0s)]
*  And what was your... [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=117.0s)]
*  They want open borders. I just actually asked the governor, because it's so, you know, you always like to understand the other side's opinion if you're on the other side of something. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=120.0s)]
*  The one thing nobody can tell me other than they want to cheat with the votes, because, you know, they're trying to sign people up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=128.0s)]
*  But why do they want this? Why do they want to infect our country like this? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=133.0s)]
*  Why are they sending these people from prison? And why are they sending people from mental institutions? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=137.0s)]
*  And how is that a good thing? And even from a political standpoint, how can you win an election when you're doing this, what they're doing? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=142.0s)]
*  And Texas took the right stance, and Arizona's going to have to step it up because the whole country is going to be very upset with the governor of Arizona, I can tell you that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=149.0s)]
*  You saw the police officers in Times Square. Times Square at night is lit up like broad daylight. It's as bright as it could be. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=158.0s)]
*  It's just kind of like Vegas. And here I'm watching two police officers getting the hell beat out of them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=165.0s)]
*  A guy running up full force and kicking this guy in the head. And I'm like, wow, how is this happening in our country? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=173.0s)]
*  You've never seen that before? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=180.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=182.0s)]
*  It's even worse. We've seen them shot. We've seen them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=183.0s)]
*  But you've never seen police officers in a fistfight with guys, and they're openly fist fighting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=186.0s)]
*  And the odds weren't good because they were about 10 to 2. But it's something I've never seen before. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=192.0s)]
*  Again, there's more violence than that because you see shots and you see other things. But it's something you've never seen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=198.0s)]
*  It's a total disrespect for the law. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=204.0s)]
*  Americans have unified against illegal immigration right now and more than on any other issue. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=207.0s)]
*  And so I think that's going to change what's going on in these cities in these states. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=214.0s)]
*  Look at the citizens in Chicago that are fighting back against city council members. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=218.0s)]
*  Same thing that's going on in New York against city council members or the mayor, whatever the case may be. They're angry. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=222.0s)]
*  Look at the backlash that the mayor of Athens, Georgia got when he was trying to talk about how safe he was making the city. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=228.0s)]
*  Americans are outraged. Like I've never seen. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=234.0s)]
*  I know both of you have been very busy, but there was at Georgia University of Georgia, they had a service, a rally for this young nursing student that lost her life. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=237.0s)]
*  And thousands and thousands of people showed up. The people of this country have had it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=248.0s)]
*  We have borders, we have laws, and we should have sovereignty. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=254.0s)]
*  Now, I don't think either of you disagree with legal immigration. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=259.0s)]
*  Shouldn't that include vetting people to make sure they don't have radical ties and maybe a health check? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=263.0s)]
*  And also they have to show that they're not going to be a burden financially on the American people? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=269.0s)]
*  So, Sean, this is another issue that actually has galvanized people who are either here or want to come here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=273.0s)]
*  And that is there are so many people who want to come here legally. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=277.0s)]
*  They're getting pushed to the back of the line because of the nine million people who come here illegally. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=281.0s)]
*  So what Biden has done is destroyed legal immigration while he's facilitated illegal immigration. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=285.0s)]
*  This is an invasion of military age men. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=291.0s)]
*  And I pray to God that I'm wrong. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=294.0s)]
*  But I have no doubt the people in Iran, Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, China and Russia, among them are not people that have our best intentions at heart. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=297.0s)]
*  And they are here in this country plotting, planning and scheming. That's just scary. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=306.0s)]
*  I think I'm right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=311.0s)]
*  I sadly I think I'm right, too. I wish I was wrong. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=312.0s)]
*  Great to see you, Governor. Thank you so much. Appreciate you. Great group here. Thank you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=315.0s)]
*  Mr. President, always great to see you. Thank you very much. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPRD7E7Dp8&t=319.0s)]
