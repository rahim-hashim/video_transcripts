# Riley Gaines rips 'absurd' Democratic Party
**Fox News:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=0.0s)]
*  The media mob, guess what, still has not learned their lesson from the election. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=4.16s)]
*  Here's CNN giving some very questionable advice to the ailing Democratic Party. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=9.08s)]
*  I think DEI is really important. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=15.92s)]
*  But the reason why DEI is important is because it's going to make America more competitive, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=17.8s)]
*  and we're going to be able to go out into the world and win and keep our companies as [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=21.04s)]
*  competitive as possible. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=24.84s)]
*  That's not really a progressive argument. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=25.84s)]
*  But it is an argument that includes every American, which is what Democrats stand for. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=28.54s)]
*  The people actually that they should be listening to, Bernie Sanders and Stacey Abrams, those [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=33.18s)]
*  are the two people who have been very consistent and very in touch with the American public [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=37.9s)]
*  that have been related to the Democratic Party. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=42.1s)]
*  Those are the people that are going to help pick the leadership of the Democratic Party, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=44.42s)]
*  or at the very least should be helping to pick the leadership of the Democratic Party [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=47.58s)]
*  as we move forward into this next election cycle. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=51.06s)]
*  Yeah, well, they should just keep going with that advice because it's very, very bad for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=53.7s)]
*  them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=57.379999999999995s)]
*  Unfortunately, this is par for the course for the mainstream media. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=58.46s)]
*  For example, according to last week's MRC study, the broadcast network's coverage [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  of Donald Trump's cabinet picks has been 96 percent negative, or whatever. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, polling shows that a majority of Americans approve of the president-elect's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  transition and believe that he will do a good job in his second term, all while Donald Trump's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=78.06s)]
*  reaches a seven-year high. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=85.86s)]
*  Keep in mind that's after everything the media and that they've swamped into him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=88.54s)]
*  He's more popular than ever. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=94.14s)]
*  Here now with reaction, Gaines for Girls podcast host Riley Gaines, you know her well, and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=96.98s)]
*  Fox News contributors Joe Concha and Leo Terrell. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=101.86s)]
*  They never have any opinions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=104.5s)]
*  I'm going to have to drag it out of them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=105.5s)]
*  Riley, I do want to start with you because we're looking at, it's almost like mass [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=107.26s)]
*  hysteria, that they lost an election. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=112.94s)]
*  There was a statement about what we wanted and what we didn't. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=115.94s)]
*  Your work is based in what we don't want, which is we don't want biological men in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=118.98s)]
*  women's sports. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=124.38s)]
*  It's an issue of fairness. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=125.38s)]
*  And yet they don't, the DEI, it's like saying, oh, it's going to make us more competitive. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=127.26s)]
*  How does not hiring people on merit make you more competitive? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=133.1s)]
*  How do you respond to this refusal to acknowledge the reality of our situation? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=139.06s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's very good to be with you, Tammy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=144.02s)]
*  Look, DEI does not stand for diversity, equity and inclusion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=147.22s)]
*  It stands for discrimination, exclusion and indoctrination. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=151.02s)]
*  And so to watch this, and I think it's important to mention too, that the two Democrats that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=155.66s)]
*  they named to be able to follow and to take advice from was Stacey Abrams, a two-time [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=161.06s)]
*  loser and runs for Georgia governor, and the 83-year-old socialist, that is Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=166.1s)]
*  So, I mean, did they learn nothing on November 5th? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=172.1s)]
*  I certainly believe, and I've said this many times even on Handy Show before, I believe [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=174.66s)]
*  people turned out to the polls to embrace Donald Trump, to embrace his cabinet picks, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=179.22s)]
*  to embrace the America First agenda. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  But more so, I believe that people turned out to the polls to reject absurdity. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  And that is exactly what the Democratic Party has become, allowing men in women's sports, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=190.88s)]
*  believing that men can become pregnant and that they can breastfeed. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=195.02s)]
*  The whole idea of referring to Latino individuals as Latinx, Democrats have lost the ability [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=198.3s)]
*  to communicate with common sense everyday Americans. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  Yes, and the good news is, but others have been out there to point that out and to provide [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=206.66s)]
*  the example of the opposite like yourself. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  Joe Concha, you look at the media all the time, but you're also an analyst. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=213.94s)]
*  You see the nature of what is going on here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=219.38s)]
*  What's your thought on this refusal to embrace the truth? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=222.14s)]
*  Well, the 45th and future 47th president, Tammy, won the popular vote, won the electoral [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  vote in a landslide. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=233.44s)]
*  His party won back the Senate. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=234.94s)]
*  They held the House. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=236.44s)]
*  Forty-eight of 50 states went more red than blue. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=237.73999999999998s)]
*  Yet nearly 100 percent of the coverage of the Trump transition is negative. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's 31 flavors of idiocy. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=246.66s)]
*  I mean, our legacy media, Tammy, has learned nothing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=249.78s)]
*  You know why? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=253.10000000000002s)]
*  Because they choose to learn nothing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=254.10000000000002s)]
*  Most of our media only exists to serve at the pleasure of the Democrat party. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=256.26s)]
*  There will be no come to Jesus moment, only continued come to, you know, Soros moments, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=260.22s)]
*  I guess. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=265.66s)]
*  Donald Trump or anyone who doesn't have a D next to their name will never get a fair [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=266.66s)]
*  shake. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=270.94s)]
*  CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, Washington Post, PBS, CBS, NBC, you know, pick your acronym. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=271.94s)]
*  They will never change as long as their so-called talent and management stays the same. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=279.66s)]
*  These are activists, not journalists. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  And they will go down with the ship before they ever change or apologize. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  So that's where we're at at this point. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=290.58000000000004s)]
*  The good news is that it didn't work. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=292.66s)]
*  They did this for eight years against Donald Trump. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=296.5s)]
*  And then only positive for Biden, with the exception of after Afghanistan, which the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=300.58000000000004s)]
*  debacle of that was just horrible. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=305.18s)]
*  And what Joe describes, it didn't work. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=308.26s)]
*  In fact, it had the opposite effect. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=311.9s)]
*  What do you think that means? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=313.58s)]
*  Well, it tells me this, Tammy, based on everything you just talked about, what Joe said and what [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=314.58s)]
*  Riley said, the Democrats and the leftists are going to continue. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=321.02s)]
*  They do not want Trump to succeed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=325.06s)]
*  They want him to fail. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=327.7s)]
*  I will tell you this without any doubt. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=329.29999999999995s)]
*  Expect them to attack, attack, attack. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=331.5s)]
*  They don't care about saving or preserving or making America great. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  They want to destroy America. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=337.7s)]
*  So they will never find anything good in President Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=339.58s)]
*  President Trump was very clear what he wanted to do. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=343.22s)]
*  Secure the border. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=344.94s)]
*  The Democrats are against it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=345.94s)]
*  He wants law and order. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=346.94s)]
*  The Democrats are against it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=348.22s)]
*  He wants to eliminate D&I. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=349.46000000000004s)]
*  The Democrats are opposed to that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=350.86s)]
*  The people voted and spoke on November 5th. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=353.54s)]
*  And the Democrats and the left-wing media basically got their hands over their eyes [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=357.1s)]
*  and hands over their ears. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=361.62s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=363.42s)]
*  They will go after Trump. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=364.74s)]
*  But I'll tell you this, Trump is going to succeed because he focuses on the needs of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=366.02s)]
*  Americans, not the elite. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=370.98s)]
*  You know, that's right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=372.98s)]
*  I mean, this is, you're completely correct. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=374.38s)]
*  If people are waiting for the left to have an epiphany, some kind of, you know, come [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=377.1s)]
*  to Jesus moment, it's not going to happen. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=382.06s)]
*  And it's clear. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we have to recognize that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  And I think we're ready for it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=387.9s)]
*  Riley, Joe, Leo, thank you very much. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=389.38s)]
*  Great job. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=391.74s)]
*  Have a great night. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ8RiI6038c&t=392.74s)]
