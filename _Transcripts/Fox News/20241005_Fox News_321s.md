# Newt Gingrich: I almost felt sorry for Tim Walz
**Fox News:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA)
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's start with the debate last night. Get your reaction. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=4.48s)]
*  Well, I think it was a great moment for JD Vance. I thought he was remarkable. It's almost a case [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=9.28s)]
*  study that people could use to say, this is how you do it, including taking on the CBS [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=16.64s)]
*  moderator when she clearly was wrong and just going right at her. I mean, it was absolutely [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=24.48s)]
*  the right thing. He was friendly. He was personable. When it was appropriate, he used [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=29.92s)]
*  things out of his own family, his own background. I thought it was remarkable. And you watched [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=36.24s)]
*  Waltz, who really is not in the right league. I mean, Waltz shouldn't be out there. He's not [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=42.24s)]
*  a national player. He's not fast enough. He doesn't know enough. He's not confident enough. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=47.84s)]
*  And I almost felt sorry for him because he'd been put in a position where, as one point, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=53.92s)]
*  JD Vance said, you know, you have a problem because you have to play whack-a-mole, because [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  every time you turn around, something would come up where he'd have to somehow defend [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Kamal Harrison. I thought that JD won by such a big margin—I did a newsletter today at [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=70.72s)]
*  Game of 360, and I said, you know, that a star is born. I mean, I think JD Vance now [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=76.56s)]
*  absolutely vindicates Donald Trump's instinct in picking him and represents the kind of clear [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=82.72s)]
*  compassionate but genuinely conservative and genuinely tough leader that we're going to need [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=90.88s)]
*  for the future. And I think it was an enormous victory for Trump and Vance last night. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=97.84s)]
*  I can't tell you independently how many people use the analogy to me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=105.12s)]
*  Elmer Fudd. I mean, he was just out of his league. I don't think he's ready to be president, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=110.72s)]
*  and I don't think Kamala Harris is ready to be president. And I did think that moment when JD [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=116.08s)]
*  took on the moderators, he might have stolen that page from you because Chris Wallace was [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=120.96s)]
*  moderating a debate when you were running for president, and you just turned to him and said, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=126.4s)]
*  that is a Mickey Mouse question. And it was extremely effective, and he got very triggered [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=130.96s)]
*  by that moment. Yeah, I think—I don't think he ever quite got over it. Look, I think if you're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=136.0s)]
*  going to allow these left-wing self-important newspeople to moderate debates, you have to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=143.92s)]
*  put them in a box. You know, they can't screw it up. They can't be biased. They can't come out and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=153.27999999999997s)]
*  correct you, particularly—and, by the way, every time they tried to correct him, JD Vance was right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=159.04s)]
*  He was right technically about the illegal status of the Haitians in Springfield. It's a fiction [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  that they're here illegally. It's a gimmick of the bureaucracy. He was right in taking on [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=172.24s)]
*  the law which allows a doctor to not take care of a baby if it's born and is still alive after an [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=180.4s)]
*  abortion. And I think at least eight babies have died in Waltz's Minnesota under this new law. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=187.28s)]
*  And Waltz was just plain lying. The law is very, very clear. What was impressive was that on every [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  topic, JD was able to talk from facts, from knowledge, and to do so precisely and at the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=200.72s)]
*  same time communicate a human nature, his background. You know, for example, he understands [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=208.0s)]
*  the problems of the mountains of North Carolina because he grew up in the mountains. He is from [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=214.64s)]
*  Appalachia. That's the whole point of hillbilly elegy. And so I think he has a sensitivity to what [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=219.92s)]
*  it means to these small towns that are currently cut off and where, frankly, the Biden-Harris [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=226.0s)]
*  administration has failed so badly that it should be a national scandal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=232.56s)]
*  What do you think of the state of the campaign right now? We have our pollsters coming up, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=239.36s)]
*  a lot of good polls out for Donald Trump in the last two days. Your thoughts? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=242.88s)]
*  Oh, I think Trump will, if I tell everybody who asked me about this, make sure all your friends [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=249.2s)]
*  vote. If everybody votes who favors Donald Trump, he's going to win. His challenge is that he has a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=254.08s)]
*  large, we've now reversed the two parties. We now have the challenge the Democrats used to have. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=260.88s)]
*  The core base of Trump's support are people who are less likely to vote. So he's got to motivate [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  them. This is why I favor voting early, because that means you've got your vote in there and they [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  can focus on getting other people out to vote. If everybody votes, Trump will win, and my prediction [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=278.72s)]
*  is it'll be by a much bigger margin than anybody currently expects. I also think if you look at the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  long Sherman strike, you look at what's happening in Ukraine, you look at what's happening in the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=290.72s)]
*  Middle East, you look at what's happening in North Carolina, I think that the Biden administration [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  and Harris can't possibly cope with that many parallel crises. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=301.04s)]
*  All right, Newt Gingrich, great to see you. 34 days to go. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XH29FYWAtA&t=305.2s)]
