# Karoline Leavitt: All demographics are turning on the Democratic Party
**Fox News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ)
*  Meanwhile the momentum and the excitement surrounding Trump is incredible. Take a look at this moment from this weekend's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=0.0s)]
*  NCAA wrestling championship. It was in Philly. Take a look [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  All right here with reaction the Hannity White House press briefing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=30.0s)]
*  Here she is herself Caroline Leavitt is with us White House press secretary Caroline. Good to have you [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=39.32s)]
*  And I noticed they don't want to cover those things those moments where people are chanting happy, you know clapping and adoring their president [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=44.04s)]
*  Why show that when they can smear him 24-7 and stay on that lost message from November? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=51.72s)]
*  Mm-hmm, that's exactly right Sean you hit the nail on the head in your opening monologue [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=58.44s)]
*  First of all, the Democrat Party has gone woke and now they have gone broke [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=63.92s)]
*  They have their lowest approval ratings ever and they are rallying around two of the most far-left leaders in their party [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  AOC and Jasmine Crockett. So that tells you the current state of the Democrat Party [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=76.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is enjoying some of his highest favorability ratings ever [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=81.88s)]
*  He is more popular with the American public than he has ever been which is truly remarkable [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=86.44s)]
*  When you think about all of the lies hoaxes and smears [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=91.56s)]
*  He has suffered at the behest of the lying fake news media and I'm so glad you played the video from the NCAA [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=94.86s)]
*  Tournament on Saturday night. I was there with the president in the entire arena went [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=102.0s)]
*  electric it was electric energy in the arena when President Trump entered the crowd and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=107.97999999999999s)]
*  Every single wrestler that won their match came over to shake the hand of the president of the United States [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  And it's because young men young women [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=119.8s)]
*  And people of all ages in this country love and adore this president because they see a true leader in him [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=122.12s)]
*  And if you look deeper at those Democrat Party numbers all demographics are turning against them [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=128.52s)]
*  Especially the base that they have long relied on young women are no longer looking to the Democrat Party you look at Hispanic Americans [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=134.68s)]
*  Even legal immigrants who came to this country the right way because they are disgusted by the open border policies of the past four years [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=141.72s)]
*  And they love that this president is finally doing something about that open border and securing it in just two months on the job [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Let me put up again for the audience all of these companies that have invested all this money and you've got foreign countries as well [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  We're well over two trip with three trillion dollars in investments that are now committed to America is [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=165.56s)]
*  been so much negative chatter and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=171.2s)]
*  Skittishness on Wall Street, which has now shifted back in in the in the growth mode again [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=174.2s)]
*  But but look at what the president's threat of a tariff is doing people like, okay [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=180.32s)]
*  I don't want any part of that we're gonna build in the United States [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=186.2s)]
*  So clearly that part is working and I would imagine that the president knowing him as well as I do that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  He is negotiating with these countries saying if you're gonna hit us with tariffs, we'll have to hit you back [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=195.1s)]
*  Do you want free and fair trade? We're in if you don't want free and fair trade and you got a tariff us [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=199.98s)]
*  We'll tariff you back. Is that hard to figure out because I don't think it's that hard [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=204.7s)]
*  It's not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=209.82s)]
*  tariffs work and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=211.1s)]
*  President Trump is proving that every single day when new companies from around the world are pledging to invest [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  Billions of dollars in the United States of America in our workforce today. We had Hyundai announcing 50 [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=219.42s)]
*  20 billion dollars in American investment five billion dollars in the great state of Louisiana to build a steel plant [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=227.14s)]
*  Why because President Trump has implemented a 25 percent tariff on steel and he has told companies around the world that America is open [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=235.14s)]
*  For business and you won't face any tariffs if you bring your production to the United States [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=243.1s)]
*  You will have low taxes low energy costs and you will have the best workforce in the world [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=248.9s)]

*  This is more money coming into your community [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=259.7s)]
*  This is your hometown where you grew up that has been shuttered because globalists have sold you out [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=262.7s)]

*  Factories where your neighbors are having good paying jobs where more money is going back into your pockets and every time you go to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=269.98s)]
*  The store to purchase a product you're no longer seeing made in China on the back [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=276.82s)]
*  You are seeing made in America on the back. That's President Trump's vision with these tariffs and every day [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=280.6s)]
*  He is proving that they work and he is making America wealthy again [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=285.72s)]
*  Exit question because Democrats keep saying Republicans in the CR they cut Medicare Medicaid and Social Security [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=290.08s)]
*  Will you confirm for everybody watching the show that that has not happened and the president has pledged not to do that? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-7e-DkoHdQ&t=298.12s)]
