# Karoline Leavitt: There are many 'dangerous' liberal policies in Harris, Walz's records
**Fox News:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw)
*  All right, here with reaction, outkick founder, Clay Travis, Fox News contributor Mary Catherine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamm and Trump 2024, National Press Secretary Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Caroline, start with you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=9.92s)]
*  There's a lot to unpack here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  There is a lot to unpack because there are so many dangerously liberal policies in both [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=15.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Tim Walz's records. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  And you just pointed out many of them, Sean, and I'm perplexed by Kamala Harris and Tim [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=23.0s)]
*  Walz's campaign message. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=27.36s)]
*  They continue to say at all of these pre-scripted rally remarks, we are not going back. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=28.8s)]
*  Going back to what? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=34.4s)]
*  The days of no inflation, $1.50 gasoline, peace around this world, a secure border, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=35.64s)]
*  record low interest rates, mortgage rates, unemployment rates when the American dream [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=41.72s)]
*  was alive and well, because I think a lot of Americans, in fact, millions of them, would [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=45.56s)]
*  like to go back to those days under President Trump. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  In fact, CNN today had to admit that President Trump's job approval rating has never been [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=53.68s)]
*  higher. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=58.72s)]
*  So they can continue to push that message and will continue to push ours that the next [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=59.72s)]
*  four years will be better if we reelect President Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=63.28s)]
*  We know that because we had him for four and we had more money in our pockets, peace around [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=66.52s)]
*  this world and safety and security here at home. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=70.68s)]
*  I know it's a bit of a sugar high in the honeymoon period and they got the DNC Mary Catherine [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=74.36s)]
*  Hamm coming up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=78.88s)]
*  How does this play out? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=79.88s)]
*  Look, she is an unskilled person, but if she remains untested by people asking her tough [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=82.83999999999999s)]
*  questions, the sugar high will last a little while. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, luckily, Donald Trump will be on stage with her at some point to do that because [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=91.32s)]
*  it will end up being Trump's and the RNC's job to press her on things if the press doesn't [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  do it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=100.08s)]
*  I appreciate, by the way, the person writing in The New Yorker, this is a left of center [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=101.08s)]
*  person, it's not a right of center person, writing that piece saying, look, I might have [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=103.6s)]
*  a minority view, but journalism should be journalism and you should hold her to account [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  because she hasn't been held to account. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=110.84s)]
*  And he's right that it is a minority view, unfortunately, in journalism, as you point [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=112.84s)]
*  out, Sean, but that puts the American people in a bad position because these are people [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=116.96s)]
*  who are from the California model, who are from the Minneapolis 2020 model, and they [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=121.92s)]
*  want to export that to the rest of the country. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=126.56s)]
*  And they should be asked about what that looks like. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=128.56s)]
*  They should be held to account for the failures that they have overseen, both in the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=131.44s)]
*  administration with Kamala Harris and in Minnesota under Tim Walsh. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=135.04s)]
*  They have to be asked these questions, but I do not count on anyone but the Trump campaign [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=138.64s)]
*  to do it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  How do we get Kamala Harris's record and radical views into the, I guess, into the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=143.96s)]
*  culture to kind of pass over where everybody knows before they start voting in 38 days, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  whatever it is, Clay Travis? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  Sean, to me, and I've been saying it on my radio show, this election boils down to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=163.6s)]
*  three letters, EBC, economy, border crime. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=168.4s)]
*  That's what voters care about, especially in the Big Ten states. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=173.0s)]
*  And I think as J.D. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=177.08s)]
*  Vance and Donald Trump go out, Kamala Harris is wrong on all three of those issues. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=178.84s)]
*  I think you just have to hammer those three over and over and over again. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=185.0s)]
*  Sometimes I think Kamala benefits. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=189.76s)]
*  And this is a little bit crazy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  She's so bad and so awful at so many things that it can be distracting to go kind of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=193.52s)]
*  focus on so many different issues. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=199.84s)]
*  I think you have to look at where the voters are. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=202.4s)]
*  What are they desperately focused on? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  The economy. Things cost too much. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=206.96s)]
*  Mortgage rates are too high. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  You can't go to I say this all the time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  I take my kids to Chick-fil-A. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  It's 50 bucks to take my three boys. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=214.88s)]
*  Now they're growing. My wife and my kids, 50 bucks to go to Chick-fil-A. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  It's crazy. People feel it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=220.72s)]
*  The border. She's the czar. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=222.28s)]
*  She's allowed over 10 million, 20 million. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=224.16s)]
*  We don't even know what the actual number is with Biden in charge. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=227.08s)]
*  And then crime. She's in charge of defund the police. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=230.6s)]
*  She went and grabbed this knucklehead walls and actually doubled down on bailing [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=233.84s)]
*  people out and on actually allowing crime to flourish. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=238.96s)]
*  EBC is the answer. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  Hammer it. Focus on it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  Those are the three issues. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=248.08s)]
*  If Trump and Vance do that, Trump and Vance are going to win. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=249.68s)]
*  The Big Ten's not going for Kamala. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=253.68s)]
*  The only slight disagreement I have is I have five issues and that would be economy [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=256.72s)]
*  inflation. That would be the border, illegal immigration, all the crimes that have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  been committed, law and order, safety, security, small towns, big cities. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=265.52s)]
*  The as I said, the economy is a big issue. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=270.12s)]
*  Energy is a big issue. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=273.6s)]
*  And then America's place in the world. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  So I'd add two more. But great analysis. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=276.48s)]
*  Appreciate it. Clay Mary Cotterham. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=279.36s)]
*  Thank you, Caroline Levitt. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7eHcDoccw&t=281.4s)]
