# Vivek Ramaswamy: RFK, Jr. should take votes away from the Democrats
**Fox News:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc)
*  former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, you think Clinton and Obama and their big fundraiser [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=3.84s)]
*  and them going all in to bail out Joe, will that work? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=8.0s)]
*  I don't think it's likely to persuade voters, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  but the reality is it does show, Sean, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  who is really pulling the strings in the Democratic Party. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden's cognitive deficits, they are not a bug. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=20.64s)]
*  They're a feature for the managerial class underneath him, around him [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=23.96s)]
*  that's really pulling the strings and advancing their puppet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=27.72s)]
*  And so right now, I am really glad about how optimistic we can be [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=30.84s)]
*  with the poll numbers that we're seeing, but we cannot be complacent. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=34.6s)]
*  We know the left, we understand how they behave. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=38.36s)]
*  They behave like they're in a war. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=41.08s)]
*  We need to understand and approach this election with the same mentality. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=42.84s)]
*  So I like what we're seeing, but we can't get complacent. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=46.08s)]
*  And keep in mind, it's not Joe Biden we need to worry about. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=48.84s)]
*  It's the machine underneath him, propping him up. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  That's really what we're up against. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=54.36s)]
*  And that's what I take away from the Obama and Clinton machine involvement. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=55.64s)]
*  All right. Let's talk about where we are in the RFK factor. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=60.52s)]
*  Now, team Biden is very aggressively, you know, set up their own little war room [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=64.64s)]
*  to to go to battle with RFK Junior. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=69.64s)]
*  He's not conservative. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=74.84s)]
*  I mean, I've interviewed him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=76.16s)]
*  He support every supported every left wing, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=77.32s)]
*  radical Democratic candidate over the years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=80.44s)]
*  He wanted to be the Democratic nominee. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=82.92s)]
*  They rejected him. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=84.8s)]
*  He's a radical environmentalist, believes in the radical, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=86.36s)]
*  you know, New Green Deal and climate alarmism. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=89.36s)]
*  His his policies are far left. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=93.36s)]
*  Do you see that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=96.72s)]
*  Do you see him getting on the ballot in all 50 states? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=97.52s)]
*  Do you think the Libertarian Party will take him on? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=100.28s)]
*  Look, I think the beauty of our country is we have a free system [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=104.84s)]
*  where people are able to have ballot access if they actually meet certain criteria. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=107.2s)]
*  So the Democratic Party now is going to probably try to do everything they can. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=111.28s)]
*  To keep this man off the ballot, just as they were trying to stifle him [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=114.88s)]
*  when he was running as a Democrat. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=118.16s)]
*  But the thing that has become clear, Sean, is that he's free to have his own views [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=119.96s)]
*  on the climate change agenda, which I do think is a threat [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=123.64s)]
*  to the sovereignty of the United States on abortion, on a range of other questions [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  where he's anti Second Amendment. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=129.96s)]
*  He's a range of issues that are not aligned with the Republican Party [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=131.92s)]
*  that better align with Democrats. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  And so if he does make it on the ballot, as if he does it by the rules, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=136.56s)]
*  he deserves ballot access to do. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=140.12s)]
*  It should take votes away from the Democrats. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=142.12s)]
*  And this should be a good development, not only for President Trump, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  but I believe for this country, because what we need this November [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  is a decisive moral mandate, a landslide of Reagan 1980, 1984 proportions. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  And I think we have an opportunity to do it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=157.76s)]
*  And if RFK being in this race helps that, you know what? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=159.48s)]
*  I think that could be a good thing for this country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=162.32s)]
*  And I'm against any Democratic effort to try to remove him [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=164.28s)]
*  or keep him off the ballot, as they will try to do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=167.0s)]
*  You're on the campaign trail for President Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  Have you thought at all about maybe joining his administration? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  Should that happen? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=176.8s)]
*  Look, I'm laser focused on winning the election this November, Sean. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=179.68s)]
*  We got to keep in mind, this is still the third, fourth, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=183.0s)]
*  fifth inning of the process. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=185.52s)]
*  We can't take our eye off that ball. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=187.36s)]
*  So my focus has been, how can we help attract the kind of voters [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  that Republicans may not historically have connected with young voters [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=192.96s)]
*  across this country who are hungry for direction and purpose [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=196.4s)]
*  that President Trump will be able to provide with national pride [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  that Joe Biden isn't? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=203.64s)]
*  You think about even the Asian-American community, Indian-Americans, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=205.0s)]
*  many of whom went decisively for Joe Biden. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=207.72s)]
*  And yet their core values of meritocracy, of free speech, of the American dream [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=210.32s)]
*  align with the Republican Party of today and Donald Trump's vision for this country. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=215.12s)]
*  And so I see an opportunity to build a multi-ethnic, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=219.68s)]
*  working class coalition that defies historical partisan boundaries. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=222.64s)]
*  We got to keep our eye on the ball and actually win in November. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  We can't take our eye off and figure out what comes after. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=229.92s)]
*  Let's deliver victory. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=232.64s)]
*  And that's how we're going to save this country. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  Vivek, great to see you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xi32Mi8Qc&t=236.2s)]
