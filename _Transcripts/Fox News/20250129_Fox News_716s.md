# Zelenskyy to Hannity: Putin doesn’t want to put an end to this war
**Fox News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg)
*  Russia's unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine continues to rage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=0.0s)]
*  Many are dying infrastructure, dying, but with President Trump now in office, all parties [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=6.0s)]
*  now seem to agree it is time for the violence to end. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=10.42s)]
*  Donald Trump is giving Putin a deadline. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=13.84s)]
*  Earlier, I sat down with an interview—for an interview with Ukrainian President Zelensky [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=15.68s)]
*  to discuss that and much more. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=20.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  I understand Ukraine's need for security guarantees. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  We can go back to the Minsk agreements in 2014 and 2015, and though there are many other [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=28.64s)]
*  conditions, one is that Ukraine could not join NATO if Russia were to follow other terms. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=34.88s)]
*  This seems to be coming down to a negotiation, a territorial dispute—and I'm not taking [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=40.32s)]
*  sides here, being made by Vladimir Putin—and about Ukraine's ability to join NATO. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=47.52s)]
*  Is everything on the table for negotiations with you? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=55.44s)]
*  Once Donald Trump—we saw Donald Trump's post to Vladimir Putin, and I'll get to that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=60.76s)]
*  in a minute. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=66.0s)]
*  It was very harsh. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=67.0s)]
*  But on your end, is everything on the table? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=68.0s)]
*  This rhetoric of President Trump was not just harsh. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=71.0s)]
*  It wasn't simply severe. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=79.12s)]
*  It was just and fair. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=83.36s)]
*  And this is exactly what Putin is afraid of. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=85.76s)]
*  He doesn't want a strong Trump supporting Ukraine because it would be a strong Ukraine. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=89.16s)]
*  And territorial integrity is what every country must respect. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=99.92s)]
*  Even such country as China understands that you cannot interfere with territorial integrity. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=105.52s)]
*  But he did it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=111.68s)]
*  And he wasn't stopped by the previous agreements, like Minsk agreements. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=113.12s)]
*  that those were separatists, but they, in fact, were his men. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=122.04s)]
*  Those agreements were instigated by him, and then he started the big invasion. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  And those agreements envisaged exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  And some of our men are in his captivity for 10 years now, more than 10 years. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=152.8s)]
*  So speaking of a ceasefire, at that time, ceasefire did not work. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  And he understands. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=160.28s)]
*  By the way, in those agreements, America was not involved in the Normandy agreements. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=163.0s)]
*  It was a mistake at the time of the U.S. administration at the time. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=172.2s)]
*  If America took part in those talks, America would have forced Putin to achieve just peace. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=179.2s)]
*  But America wasn't involved there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=186.5s)]
*  And I'm very hopeful that President Trump will not allow for such an agreement to just [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=188.6s)]
*  be a piece of paper. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=195.16s)]
*  We want him to be on the side of justice, on the side of Ukraine. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=199.24s)]
*  So today, I'll tell you, if we look at what happened after the beginning of the full-scale [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=204.56s)]
*  invasion of Russia, we have regained over 50 percent of the territory he initially took. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=216.88s)]
*  And we would like to achieve a fair end to this war. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=223.92s)]
*  We are not afraid. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=230.92s)]
*  Russia is not that strong. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  But we don't want to lose more of our lives, men and women. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=235.0s)]
*  But we cannot recognize the occupation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=243.6s)]
*  That is our people, and that is our land. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=246.68s)]
*  And the right of our people is for those territories. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=249.72s)]
*  We cannot legally recognize that occupation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=254.36s)]
*  But we prefer to resolve that diplomatically, not through a military fight. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=259.92s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=266.48s)]
*  But Putin doesn't want to put an end to this war. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=267.48s)]
*  Speaking of us, what we want, we talked with President Trump about it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=271.12s)]
*  I do believe that if President Trump were in office, as Putin was amassing troops on [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=278.32s)]
*  your border, there was a window of opportunity for this to be stopped and to have a negotiated [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  settlement. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=290.36s)]
*  And I believe that likely would have happened. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=291.36s)]
*  My fear for Ukraine, for your country, and you have fought valiantly, and I'm no fan [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=292.66s)]
*  of Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=296.92s)]
*  I think he's evil, a murderer. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=298.24s)]
*  I think all of this was unnecessary. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  All of it could have been negotiated from the beginning. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=302.92s)]
*  But we are where we are. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=305.12s)]
*  And I would like Ukraine to remain a country and not have all of its infrastructure destroyed [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=306.64s)]
*  in all of this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=312.68s)]
*  The president did say about Vladimir Putin, he said the following, that their economy [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=314.88s)]
*  is failing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=319.9s)]
*  He said, settle this, stop this ridiculous war. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=321.2s)]
*  It's only going to get worse. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  If we don't make a deal in soon, I'll have no other choice but to put high levels of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  tariffs, taxes and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the U.S. and other participating [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=332.08s)]
*  countries. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=340.08s)]
*  Let's get this war, which never should have started, if I were president, over with, make [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=341.08s)]
*  a deal. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=347.48s)]
*  No more lives should be lost. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=348.72s)]
*  I agree with President Trump. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=350.88s)]
*  I don't want any more people to die in this war. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=352.44s)]
*  That's why I'm asking, if the president can put enough pressure on Vladimir Putin, and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=356.76s)]
*  is there a negotiated deal on the table that is going to take some give and take? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=363.28s)]
*  I would assume it would involve NATO. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=368.68s)]
*  It'll involve your future defenses. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=371.24s)]
*  It'll involve territorial claims that they have. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=374.0s)]
*  Do you think that deal is achievable? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  If President Trump has the will to force Putin to come to peace, he can do it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=380.0s)]
*  And if the U.S. considers pressure on Putin involving other countries, global south and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=397.0s)]
*  China, I'm sure that an agreement can be made. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=404.32s)]
*  So they make that pressure as well, pressure on Putin, I'm sure. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=407.72s)]
*  And I know that President Trump is not very happy about NATO. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=412.84s)]
*  We talked with him about it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=419.44s)]
*  But we need broader guarantees of security. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=420.92s)]
*  If there are no joint guarantees, I believe that guarantees from Europe alone will never [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=426.6s)]
*  be enough. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=433.24s)]
*  We talked about this before. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=435.24s)]
*  The Europeans understand that without guarantees of security from the United States, from President [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=437.92s)]
*  Trump, it will not be enough. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=442.92s)]
*  Putin is not afraid of Europe. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=444.92s)]
*  Unfortunately, that is so. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=447.12s)]
*  And so we need such guarantees of security. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=448.72s)]
*  And we talked about the mistake that Ukraine made at the time, back because of that pressure [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=452.48s)]
*  from the United States and the Russian Federation, when we gave away the nuclear weapons we had [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=460.36s)]
*  in exchange for that Budapest Memorandum, which gave us nothing. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=467.72s)]
*  That Budapest Memorandum was just a piece of paper, same as the Minsk agreements. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=472.12s)]
*  That memorandum, nobody really gave us support. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  Such agreements may have not enough value. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=486.8s)]
*  You're probably not as willing as I am to criticize President Biden over his handling [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=494.28s)]
*  of all of this. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=499.08s)]
*  But when we go back to the beginning of this conflict, and Russia was amassing troops along [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=500.52s)]
*  your border, he was asked the question, you know, what will your response be? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  And he said, well, it depends if it's a minor incursion or not a minor incursion. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=509.28s)]
*  The next thing I felt that President Biden was trying to control how you were fighting [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=514.32s)]
*  the war, I remember Poland offered you 28 Migs, and he vetoed that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=520.0400000000001s)]
*  And then by the end of the war, he's providing the weaponry and hundreds of billions of U.S. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=526.2800000000001s)]
*  tax dollars and allowing you to fire ballistic missiles into Russia, which resulted in Vladimir [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=533.2800000000001s)]
*  Putin saying, any country that fires a ballistic missile into Russia, now we have the ability [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=540.32s)]
*  to fire a nuclear weapon back at them. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=546.32s)]
*  I don't think that was helpful. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=548.92s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=551.2s)]
*  I'm not quite sure what you were saying did not really help. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=555.24s)]
*  Well, what I'm saying is, in the beginning, the negotiation should have started when [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=559.36s)]
*  when Putin was building up troops along your border, and he was asked about it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=567.36s)]
*  And he said, well, it depends if it's a big incursion or a minor incursion. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=573.16s)]
*  I think that was a window to get ahead of it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=576.52s)]
*  He missed it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=579.3000000000001s)]
*  Then Poland offered you Migs so that you could fight an air war against Russia after the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  conflict started. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=586.88s)]
*  And then by the end of this conflict, he's allowing you to fire ballistic missiles into [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=588.4s)]
*  Russia, which then altered their nuclear policy, which said, if you do, well, we have the right [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=593.32s)]
*  to nuke you. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=598.96s)]
*  And that then puts, as far as I'm concerned, the entire continent of Europe at risk. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  That is very dangerous. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=604.48s)]
*  That's why I think enough people have died, enough money has been spent. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=606.88s)]
*  And I would like to see, I don't want to see any lives lost. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=613.0s)]
*  Trump can assist with President Vladimir Putin, not a fan of him. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=618.48s)]
*  I think that I think he never should have invaded Ukraine to begin with. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=624.2s)]
*  I think your people have fought valiantly. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=629.76s)]
*  But I am. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=631.8000000000001s)]
*  But how many more people are going to die and how much more damage infrastructure damage [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  is going to occur? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=637.52s)]
*  I didn't hear everything, but I will try to answer. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=640.12s)]
*  Before the big-scale invasion, I was personally asking President Biden and his team, the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=644.48s)]
*  State Department, we were contacting everyone in the White House. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=651.4s)]
*  We were saying the most effective sanctions will be preventive, most important response [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=657.72s)]
*  is preventive action. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=667.08s)]
*  So give us weapons now. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=668.36s)]
*  And they were saying, we will give you weapons if they invade. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=670.16s)]
*  And I was saying, do everything you can now. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=674.8399999999999s)]
*  And that may prevent, that may stop his coming invasion. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=677.8s)]
*  Parallel with that, I was asking the European Union countries, and they could not do it [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=682.28s)]
*  without approval of the United States. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=689.0799999999999s)]
*  So they always look at the leader, the United States as the leader. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=692.76s)]
*  So during the big invasion, Ukrainians were left on their own, and we were fighting on [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=696.8399999999999s)]
*  our own. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVoVDZw4zg&t=702.8s)]
