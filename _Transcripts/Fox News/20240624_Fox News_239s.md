# Trump campaign official: CNN censored me because they can't handle the truth
**Fox News:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc)
*  After a short interview this morning on fake news CNN, Trump 2024, National Press Secretary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=0.0s)]
*  Caroline Levitt is with us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=6.0s)]
*  Look, I'd like to tell you that I'm surprised it happened, but I'm not. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=7.8s)]
*  I won't be surprised if it happens Thursday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=12.32s)]
*  I'd be pleasantly surprised if they let Donald Trump give a full, complete, uninterrupted [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=14.84s)]
*  answer to the American people and let them decide. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=21.28s)]
*  I'll be shocked if they don't step in to try and debate Trump, if Joe is struggling [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=25.56s)]
*  in any way. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=31.36s)]
*  None of this will surprise me, but the president knew this going in and he knew that it was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=32.36s)]
*  their way or the highway. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=36.64s)]
*  Otherwise, Joe wouldn't debate, would he? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=38.2s)]
*  No, he absolutely wouldn't. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=41.16s)]
*  And the fact that President Trump is knowingly walking into a three-on-one cage match with [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=43.92s)]
*  crooked Joe Biden, fake Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, who have a long history of lies against [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=48.96s)]
*  President Trump, shows his willingness and his commitment to bring his winning message [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=55.44s)]
*  to every corner of this country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=59.92s)]
*  CNN censored me today because they can't handle the truth. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=62.72s)]
*  And they have been pushing lies about President Trump since he stepped into the political [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=66.5s)]
*  arena eight years ago. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=70.68s)]
*  They propagated the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=71.92s)]
*  They helped the Biden campaign censor the truth about the Hunter Biden laptop story. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=74.42s)]
*  They pushed the Charlottesville hoax that a far left outlet finally, seven years later, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=79.14s)]
*  debunked yesterday. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=83.66s)]
*  And they have an anti-Trump bias that is at the core of their organization. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=85.54s)]
*  And we should not expect anything less from them at Thursday night's debate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=90.9s)]
*  But again, President Trump knows that, but he is still willing to step into the arena [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=94.22s)]
*  to fight back, to bring his winning message. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=98.06s)]
*  And this debate, regardless of it being three-on-one, is going to be a great opportunity for President [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=100.58s)]
*  Trump to highlight his strength, his willingness to fight for the American people with Joe [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=105.52s)]
*  Biden's weakness and his incompetent, terrible policies that are failing this country. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=110.22s)]
*  And CNN has largely refused to cover over the last three and a half years. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=114.66s)]
*  They are liberal, Democratic, hate Trump, talk show hosts masquerading as journalists. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=119.38s)]
*  What was your reaction as this was unfolding today? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=126.18s)]
*  Well, it was a little bit shocking, I'll be honest with you, to have my microphone cut [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  off and dumped from the program after less than two minutes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=134.54000000000002s)]
*  And all I was doing was repeating statements that Jake Tapper has said on air himself about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=138.06s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=144.18s)]
*  So Jake Tapper can go on the air. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=145.18s)]
*  He can lie about President Trump. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=147.02s)]
*  He can say his presidency was an American nightmare. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=148.46s)]
*  He could push the Hunter Biden laptop scandal in an effort to help Joe Biden's campaign. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=151.66000000000003s)]
*  And he can compare President Trump to Hitler, which is disgusting and egregious. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=157.86s)]
*  But when I try to breach that subject on the network, they cut me off, they can me again. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  It's because they still want Americans to believe, laughably, that they're the most [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=166.66000000000003s)]
*  trusted name in news. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  They are not. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=172.72000000000003s)]
*  They are an anti-Trump institution, just like basically every other main institution in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=173.72000000000003s)]
*  this great country. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=179.66000000000003s)]
*  And the American people are waking up to that, Sean. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=181.0s)]
*  And that's why, regardless of the lies that CNN and the mainstream media have been spewing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=182.9s)]
*  about President Trump for years, he continues to win. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=187.0s)]
*  He has the momentum in this race. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=190.4s)]
*  Recent Emerson College poll shows him winning in every battleground state. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  He's winning with independents. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=196.88s)]
*  He's picking up a historic margin of the black vote. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=198.24s)]
*  He's winning with Hispanics. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=200.56s)]
*  He's winning with women. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=201.56s)]
*  He's winning with young people, because all Americans realize that the Democrat Party [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=202.56s)]
*  is corrupt. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  They've been lying about him for years. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  And people remember just how much better their lives were under his leadership. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=210.88s)]
*  And Thursday's going to be a great reminder of that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=215.16s)]
*  You know, at some point, maybe Republicans ought to reconsider ever wasting their time, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=218.16s)]
*  like you did this morning. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=223.04s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, thank you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=224.6s)]
*  We appreciate you being here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnifmzP8mGc&t=226.0s)]
