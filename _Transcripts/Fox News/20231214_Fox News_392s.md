# Joe Manchin: There's 'enough of us in the middle' who want to take back America
**Fox News:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc)
*  All right, so Joe Biden, he is desperate to send more of your money to Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=0.0s)]
*  We've sent nearly, what, $80-some-odd billion that he's apparently willing to even trade [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=4.84s)]
*  Republicans almost anything for it, including even Trump-era immigration policies. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=9.56s)]
*  Now, Biden is now reportedly considering bringing back Title 42 or a program like that that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=15.0s)]
*  would allow Border Patrol to expel illegals on the spot. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Now, naturally, Democrats, they're not happy, calling the idea a non-starter, shameful, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=24.52s)]
*  irresponsible. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction is the Democratic senator from West Virginia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=30.88s)]
*  Joe Manchin is with us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=34.6s)]
*  Senator, we've had over 8 million, according to estimates, illegal immigrants come in this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=36.24s)]
*  country under Joe Biden, hundreds from Iran, hundreds from Syria, thousands from Egypt, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=40.96s)]
*  thousands from Afghanistan, 12,000 from Russia and over 20-some-odd thousand from China. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=47.68s)]
*  I am 100% certain that we probably have, because those borders have been wide open, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=54.88s)]
*  terror cells now in this country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=61.24s)]
*  Do you agree with me? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=63.56s)]
*  I'm as concerned and scared as you are, Sean. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=66.04s)]
*  I've truly been saying this all along. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  Our borders are a mess. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=70.36s)]
*  And, you know, to say that it's not, and for any Democrat or anybody to say that it's not [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=72.16s)]
*  in jeopardy right now, we have to close our borders down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=77.28s)]
*  We've got to control the borders. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=80.88s)]
*  And we have to change basically the asylum definition of what it takes to get in our [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=83.24s)]
*  country. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=88.96s)]
*  We want to make sure that people can still come that are in desperate need, the legal [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=89.96s)]
*  way, but not the way they're coming illegally now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  And that has to stop. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  So I believe that you're going to see some changes being made here very quickly. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=98.32s)]
*  And I think it's more than appropriate to do it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you, you said you were taking a two-month tour beginning in January to test [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=105.52s)]
*  the appetite for national movement. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=111.2s)]
*  There's been a lot of talk about the No Labels Party and whether or not they would [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=113.28s)]
*  consider running as a third party in the presidential election. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=117.52s)]
*  Is this two-month tour part of a tour for you yourself? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  Are you considering would you consider running on a No Labels Party for president in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=126.56s)]
*  2024? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=131.72s)]
*  Well, Sean, first, let me just say I'd never be a spoiler. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=133.04s)]
*  I will never be a spoiler trying to throw the race one way or the other if it would be [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=135.72s)]
*  a vantage or disadvantage. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=139.4s)]
*  That's not who I am. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=140.72s)]
*  If I get into a race, I get into it to win. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=142.2s)]
*  But basically going around, people feel homeless right now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=145.08s)]
*  They've been pushed to the extremes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=147.68s)]
*  Both parties have gone to the extremes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=149.56s)]
*  The Democrat and Republican parties are being kind of controlled and driven by the extreme [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=151.32s)]
*  right and extreme left. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=155.92s)]
*  That's not who we are as a country. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=157.28s)]
*  It's not how we became a country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=158.56s)]
*  And it's not how we remain the superpower of the world with the rest of the country or [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=160.36s)]
*  the rest of the world following us. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=163.76s)]
*  So I'm going to go out and talk to people to find out what they believe needs to be [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=165.76s)]
*  done. They'll make the decision. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=169.24s)]
*  Not me or anybody else. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=170.76s)]
*  But I want them to know that there's enough of us in the middle to want to take back our [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=172.52s)]
*  country, our values, who we are, how we became the country that we are and how we're [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=176.52s)]
*  going to be able to leave a country that we're proud of to our children and grandchildren. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  Right now, we're not on that trajectory. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=185.6s)]
*  We've got to change. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Let me ask you that. How do you reconcile people that want to enforce our immigration [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=188.28s)]
*  laws versus those that want open borders? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=192.88s)]
*  How do you reconcile those that want energy dominance and independence versus those that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=195.48s)]
*  want an immediate change over to alternative energy or quote green energy? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=200.48s)]
*  I don't even think the technology exists. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=205.2s)]
*  How do you reconcile those that want to dismantle the police, reimagine the police versus [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=208.0s)]
*  those that want law and order and safety and security? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=212.92s)]
*  I don't see middle ground on those issues, Senator. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=216.6s)]
*  Well, the Democrats have been pulled so far to the left and I think Joe Biden has been [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=220.16s)]
*  pulled to the left. I know Joe Biden and he never has governed that way. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=224.48s)]
*  He wasn't a senator for 36 years on the extremes and I'm hoping he comes back to the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=228.12s)]
*  middle. I really am. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=232.68s)]
*  But the bottom line is, is everything you have just said is what most Americans want. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=234.12s)]
*  We're not going to be extremes to the left. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  We're going to have energy security. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  Sean, we are producing more energy today than ever before in the history of our country. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=242.84s)]
*  No matter any presence prior to this, we are an administration. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  We produce more, but we've had to force them to do it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=250.0s)]
*  I work with my Republican colleagues and basically trying to get energy security, making [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=252.96s)]
*  sure that we have the energy that we need today to take care of ourselves, to be secured, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=257.84s)]
*  basically helping our allies and investing in the technology for the energy of the future. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=262.64s)]
*  We can walk and chew gum. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=267.84s)]
*  We're the United States of America. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=268.96s)]
*  We've got more investments coming to the country than ever before. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=270.64s)]
*  You never hear the president speaking about we spent two hundred and thirty billion [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  dollars of the IRA to pay down debt. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=278.2s)]
*  You never heard that. We basically it's energy security. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=280.4s)]
*  It's not an environmental bill. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  It's been great for the environment, too, if we're able to basically mature these technologies. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  But we're producing more gas, more oil, four point six billion barrels of oil this year, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=291.8s)]
*  thirty seven trillion cubic feet of gas. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=297.24s)]
*  We're still importing though. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=299.16s)]
*  And we're importing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=300.36s)]
*  We're importing because we have to we have to blend because of the type of the type of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  systems that we have. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  Let me let me ask you this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  You got to go on this two month tour. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=309.92s)]
*  There has been a lot of talk about the no labels party. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=312.2s)]
*  I'll ask you again gently. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=316.92s)]
*  I'm not pushing you hard. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  No problem. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=320.24s)]
*  I just want to know is if you got enough feedback that you felt there was an appetite for a [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=321.72s)]
*  third party, would you consider a run if you thought it was not a spoiler run? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=328.16s)]
*  To use your words. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=332.52s)]
*  Absolutely. I think that every American, if you're in a position to help your country and you [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=334.64s)]
*  don't come forward when you think we're on a wrong trajectory, then, you know, shame on you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=338.76000000000005s)]
*  I would do whatever I can to help my country. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  And right now, I think unless we're able to bring the extremes back to the middle and if the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  extremes don't come to the middle, make sure the middle is able to dominate. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  That's where I'm looking at. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  But basically, no labels has always been a group that's look for a balanced venue that we [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  could bring Democrats and Republicans that felt homeless. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=360.36s)]
*  I've been there since 2010. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=363.32000000000005s)]
*  I understand where they're coming from. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=364.68s)]
*  I've been to West Virginia. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=366.8s)]
*  I know the people of West Virginia. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=368.56s)]
*  They're pretty conservative. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  They like you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  They like you, Sean. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  I like you, buddy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=374.48s)]
*  I like them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  I appreciate it, Senator. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=376.76s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=377.88s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy-AJ5THyc&t=378.8s)]
