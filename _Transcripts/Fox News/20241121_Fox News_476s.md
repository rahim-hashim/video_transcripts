# Stephen Miller: Trump will bring America into a new ‘golden age’
**Fox News:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k)
*  All right, we bring back in—hopefully we bring back in—I hope he can hear me—incoming [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=0.0s)]
*  White House Deputy Chief of Policy Stephen Miller is with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=5.8s)]
*  Stephen, how are you? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=8.76s)]
*  I am good, Sean, my old friend. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=11.6s)]
*  After nine years, we are here on the heels of a landslide that the world has never seen [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=14.56s)]
*  before, prepared under President Trump's leadership to implement historical, transformative, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  long-awaited change to make this government accountable to the people of this country [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=27.8s)]
*  once again. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=32.56s)]
*  It will be, as Donald Trump said, a new golden age for America. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=33.7s)]
*  I want to go through how dramatic this is going to be, because what I hear the president [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=37.9s)]
*  is proposing—and look at Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, and they're setting up this new [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=43.52s)]
*  department and they're going to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, and they're going [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=48.32s)]
*  to cut by July 4th, 2026, $2 trillion in federal spending. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=53.28s)]
*  That is a monumental task. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=58.96s)]
*  And there are ways to do it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=61.2s)]
*  I think one way to do it would be to increase revenues. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  That would be through energy dominance. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=65.92s)]
*  That's a separate topic. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=67.36s)]
*  But this is transformative, what the president's talking about. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  For the first time, we've heard conservatives for years talk about limited government, cutting [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  waste, fraud and abuse, and now somebody—for the first time in my adult life, if you will, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=77.84s)]
*  to catch a phrase, I'm believing it's going to happen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  How real is that, that they're going to cut to that extent? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=87.66s)]
*  Well, the president has put together the Dream Team. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=91.68s)]
*  And you just mentioned two members of the Dream Team. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=96.84s)]
*  So you have the Department of Government Efficiency that, from the outside, is going to direct [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=99.12s)]
*  and organize this extraordinary effort to remove all of the waste and the corruption [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=104.88s)]
*  from the federal government. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=110.64s)]
*  So they will do that in concert and in league with the White House, President Trump, the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=112.28s)]
*  Office of Management and Budget. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=116.44s)]
*  Here's the shocking truth, Sean. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=118.12s)]
*  The departments do not have any clue where the dollars are going. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=120.24s)]
*  How many audits has the Pentagon failed? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=124.0s)]
*  Who has any idea how much waste and abuse there is in the trillions of dollars spent [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=126.88s)]
*  by this federal government? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=132.48s)]
*  Who has any idea how many hundreds of billions of dollars every year are stolen, stolen from [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=134.14s)]
*  taxpayers by fraud rings, scammers, foreign operatives? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  This government is not watching how your dollars are being spent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  And President Trump has commissioned Elon and Vivek and many others across the government [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=148.66s)]
*  to get to the bottom of this, so the money that you earn as an American citizen will [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  be jealously treasured and guarded and not wasted any longer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=159.45999999999998s)]
*  And we are going to go into these agencies and find everybody who is not performing on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=163.38s)]
*  behalf of the American public. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=168.14s)]
*  And we're going to say if you're not providing that service, if you're not serving the public, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=169.66s)]
*  then you can go. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=173.7s)]
*  The border has been a big issue. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  How quickly, in your estimation, can that border get secure, number one? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=177.62s)]
*  And we have known terrorists in the country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=181.78s)]
*  We have people that have murdered Americans. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  We have the Lake and Riley trial going on right now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=185.34s)]
*  Dozens of dead Americans murdered by Harris Biden, unvetted illegals. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=189.06s)]
*  We have dozens of Americans raped, hundreds and hundreds victims of violent crime. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=193.54s)]
*  We have gang members. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=198.18s)]
*  We have cartel members in this country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=199.54s)]
*  How quickly do we secure the border? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=201.74s)]
*  How quickly do we deport those that are criminal aliens in the country? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=203.58s)]
*  It's going to be at light speed, Sean. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=207.74s)]
*  The moment that President Trump puts his hand on that Bible and takes the oath of office, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  as he has said, the occupation ends, Liberation Day begins. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=217.44s)]
*  He will immediately sign executive orders sealing the border shut, beginning the largest [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=221.44s)]
*  deportation operation in American history, finding the criminal gangs, rapists, drug [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  dealers and monsters that have murdered our citizens and sending them home. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=231.12s)]
*  No one will be allowed to enter the country illegally, and ICE will be empowered in partnership [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=236.72s)]
*  with FBI, DEA, ATF, the National Guard to fully seal and secure the border with CBP [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=241.28s)]
*  and to find and identify the criminal threats that are inside this country and send them [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=248.36s)]
*  back home. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=252.8s)]
*  We saw that heartbreaking testimony, Sean. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=253.8s)]
*  Lake and Riley, that precious, beautiful young woman, fought for her life against an illegal [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=256.56s)]
*  alien imported by Biden Harris for 18 harrowing minutes. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=262.32s)]
*  She fought for her life, and we are going to honor that extraordinary woman, and we're [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=266.32s)]
*  going to honor every victim who has suffered under President Trump's leadership. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=271.48s)]
*  We're going to honor that suffering by unleashing a righteous wave of justice and sending these [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=275.04s)]
*  criminal migrants back home. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=281.62s)]
*  How do we ensure that the weaponization of the Department of Justice never happens in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=285.14s)]
*  this country again? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=291.2s)]
*  And that means it shouldn't happen to Republicans. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=292.42s)]
*  It shouldn't happen to Democrats. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=294.68s)]
*  How do we get rid of political operatives that have deviated from their original mission [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=296.44s)]
*  that are inside important groups like the FBI or our intelligence community? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=302.3s)]
*  How do we find those actors that are loyal to Clapper and Brennan and Comey, the deep [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=308.72s)]
*  state operatives, as we call them? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=315.64s)]
*  Well, dismaying the deep state and restoring democracy is going to be another urgent day [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=318.16s)]
*  one mission. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=323.94s)]
*  Look, the Department of Justice and the intelligence community has undermined and sabotaged our [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=324.94s)]
*  democracy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=330.46s)]
*  They've tried to stop Donald Trump through third state despotic means. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=331.78s)]
*  President Trump winning this election has also won a mandate to fundamentally reform [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=337.4s)]
*  the Department of Justice, the FBI and the entire intelligence community. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=342.7s)]
*  at the Directorate of National Intelligence will lead the effort to find those bad actors [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=347.74s)]
*  and to ensure that the intelligence collection process across all 18 intelligence agencies [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=355.08s)]
*  is done only to protect Americans, not to persecute them. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=361.14s)]
*  At the same time, Matt Gaetz at the Department of Justice will reform DOJ to turn it again [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  into the world's premier crime-fighting organization, not an arm of the Democrat Party. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=369.6s)]
*  And we will find an FBI director who is going to likewise lead an effort to get the FBI [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=375.58s)]
*  back to basics, find criminals, find cartels, find gangs, find terrorists and put them in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=381.14s)]
*  jail or send them home. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=387.34s)]
*  But do not use the awesome powers of the FBI to try to rig our democracy as has happened [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=389.47999999999996s)]
*  in recent years. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=395.94s)]
*  This is why President Trump is indeed the greatest champion of democracy in modern American [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=397.56s)]
*  history because he weathered the attacks, he withstood the assaults and now he stands [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=402.9s)]
*  here on the verge of taking the oath of office prepared to make these agencies, make these [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=408.06s)]
*  departments once more answerable and loyal to the citizens of this country and to no [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=414.85999999999996s)]
*  other interests but them. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=421.85999999999996s)]
*  If there are some cabinet appointments that become troublesome, will the president use [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=424.17999999999995s)]
*  the recess appointment process? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=429.74s)]
*  Yes, the president has won a mandate and he will use all lawful constitutional means to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=432.62s)]
*  fulfill that mandate on behalf of the people who voted for him in record numbers. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=439.42s)]
*  Alright, Stephen Miller, are you getting a new office this time? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=444.5s)]
*  Just checking. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  It should be a nice office, Sean, but that's not what I'm focused on. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=449.78000000000003s)]
*  We just want to get the job done. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=454.22s)]
*  No, get a bigger one this time. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=455.70000000000005s)]
*  I have humble advice. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=457.74s)]
*  If you're there, it's your second term. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=458.74s)]
*  I'll ask the president. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=460.74s)]
*  Alright, I'll ask on your behalf. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=461.74s)]
*  See what he says. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYrow1p84k&t=463.74s)]
