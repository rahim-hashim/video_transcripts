# Why did the Philadelphia aircraft come down so fast?
**Fox News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE)
*  Now to aviation attorney Sal Lagonia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=0.0s)]
*  Sal, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=3.6s)]
*  Let's first talk about what we're seeing on the video. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=6.08s)]
*  We'll keep playing this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=8.68s)]
*  And that is the actual missile-like descent that we just showed it on the screen, and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=10.18s)]
*  then explosion when it hits. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=17.36s)]
*  What can you glean from that video? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=20.38s)]
*  I think I've watched that video over and over, maybe about 100 times already now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=24.32s)]
*  And the one thing that really stands out is the angle of descent. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=29.88s)]
*  That thing is coming down, like you said, it's like a rocket. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=33.6s)]
*  I first thought that that may have been what hit Philadelphia until we realized it was [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=36.8s)]
*  an airplane. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=40.84s)]
*  Airplanes, it's hard to do that with an airplane. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=41.84s)]
*  As short and stubby as the wings are on a Learjet 55, you still have that ability to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=44.64s)]
*  move forward with a plane on the most circumstances. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  The word catastrophic has been bandied about all night. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=56.4s)]
*  That had to happen on board, whether it was catastrophic engine failure in both engines, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  in which case you would have expected that there would have been a mayday call, but listening [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=64.76s)]
*  to the tape of the tower, there was no mayday call, or some kind of fuel exhaustion or fuel [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=69.26s)]
*  â€” it wouldn't be fuel exhaustion, but it would have been fuel contamination that took [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=76.36s)]
*  both engines out at the same time. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  And then we get into the type of aircraft it is. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=83.02s)]
*  It's a medevac aircraft, which has oxygen on board. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=85.84s)]
*  My understanding is that the police have found at least one oxygen tank far away from the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=89.2s)]
*  scene. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=94.0s)]
*  That could indicate that it came out of the aircraft while the aircraft was descending [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=95.0s)]
*  from 1,600 feet. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=99.24s)]
*  It wasn't up that high. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=100.24s)]
*  Well, it was at 1,600 feet, then dropping, you know, 2,400 feet per minute, as you said, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=101.84s)]
*  you know, shooting down to Earth like a rocket. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=108.08s)]
*  You can almost see it's traveling at this high speed, full throttle, nose down. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=112.48s)]
*  Do you see a possibility of maybe a stall? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=118.92s)]
*  And would that result in that trajectory or no? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=122.56s)]
*  I agree with the other guess. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=126.92s)]
*  I think that's highly unlikely. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  I think there's something much more going on before the plane starts down. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=130.12s)]
*  It really is out of control. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=135.24s)]
*  You can see it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=137.44s)]
*  There's going to be something venting out of the plane as it's coming down, if you look [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=138.44s)]
*  closely. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=141.68s)]
*  And then finally, when it hits the ground, it makes that huge explosion. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=142.68s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=146.12s)]
*  Because it's full of fuel. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=147.12s)]
*  It's starting its trip back to Springfield. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=148.2s)]
*  And so there's a lot of fuel on board, almost a thousand gallons of fuel. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=151.48s)]
*  And that's going to hit any spark is going to create an explosion, the likes of what [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=154.96s)]
*  we saw. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=161.0s)]
*  And yeah, there were low cloud covers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=162.28s)]
*  So that's going to make the explosion look even worse. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=163.92s)]
*  But frankly, you're looking at the amount of fires in the area. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=167.4s)]
*  That's from the airplane hitting the ground so hard that its fuel is spraying out and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=172.72s)]
*  hitting the mall, hitting the cars that are in the vicinity there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=178.04s)]
*  There were, I think, three houses also that were on fire. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=182.04s)]
*  So would you say that the more likely scenario is that the airplane was in a nose down at [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=185.44s)]
*  altitude with full throttles based on that velocity? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=192.92s)]
*  And how could that happen? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=198.24s)]
*  Well, not necessarily. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=199.24s)]
*  What scenario would cause that? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=200.24s)]
*  Well, not necessarily full throttle, because if it's starting to fall, it's going to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=203.92s)]
*  start picking up speed just from gravity. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=209.56s)]
*  But what could cause it? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=212.24s)]
*  There's a whole host of things. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=213.6s)]
*  And as I went through my usual list of trying to figure out what could have happened normally, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=215.48s)]
*  what do we normally see when we have an accident like this? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=221.28s)]
*  There are so many things I couldn't check off yet because we don't know enough quite yet. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  We've got to get more information. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=229.28s)]
*  It's going to be hard in this case because the aircraft itself is consumed in the fire. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=231.12s)]
*  The NTSB is going to have their work cut out for them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  One of the first things they'll do is they'll try to find the footprint of the airplane, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=240.08s)]
*  find out where the left wing is, where the right wing is, where all these things landed [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=244.68s)]
*  and where they land sometimes can help them determine how fast it was coming down and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=249.64s)]
*  how much force there was used prior to the descent that we saw. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=260.92s)]
*  Well, I want to give an update. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=261.92s)]
*  The mayor of Philly said they don't have any information on the fatalities. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=265.0s)]
*  The mayor says everyone should stay away from the scene. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=269.64s)]
*  She confirmed what we all know, that we lost an aircraft. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=272.8s)]
*  We don't have any further information. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=276.6s)]
*  If you see debris, call 911, which I think is good advice. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=278.20000000000005s)]
*  As I mentioned, President Trump has commented publicly on Truth Social, quote, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=283.48s)]
*  So sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=288.88000000000005s)]
*  More innocent souls are lost. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  Our people are totally engaged. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=294.68s)]
*  First responders are already being given credit for doing a great job. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=297.16s)]
*  More to follow. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=301.06s)]
*  God bless you all. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=302.06s)]
*  It's always sad to see something like this, isn't it? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=303.06s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  And I'm glad to see President Trump is out in front of this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=309.56s)]
*  And Duffy is involved, Secretary Duffy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=313.04s)]
*  It's good to get the higher ups out there. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=316.12s)]
*  Be the point people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=318.58000000000004s)]
*  Put people on, give them some confidence in the aviation system. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  After the couple of days that we've just had, it's a little hard to do that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=323.44000000000005s)]
*  But aviation is safe. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=328.04s)]
*  These two incidents are not related. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=329.8s)]
*  These two incidents are very different. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=332.3s)]
*  When we get to the bottom of it, we will. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  That's what makes aviation so safe. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=336.02000000000004s)]
*  We have the NTSB. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=337.88s)]
*  They will give us a probable cause at some point when they can. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  And when they're sure of all the evidence. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's going to make aviation even safer. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=345.11999999999995s)]
*  We have, as aviators, we have an obligation to do that for the people after us. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=347.73999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we really do. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=353.12s)]
*  Sal, we really appreciate your time, as always. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=354.64s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtqm2SFfBE&t=356.96s)]
