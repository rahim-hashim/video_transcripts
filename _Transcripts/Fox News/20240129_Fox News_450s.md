# Abbott: Much of America is standing against Biden on his open border
**Fox News:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU)
*  Here with more Texas Governor Greg Abbott governor first I applaud your efforts. You've been on this show many times [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=0.0s)]
*  You've tried convoys you you have done everything humanly possible [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  So your state and with its constitutional right has put up the razor wire [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=11.36s)]
*  They take you to court on that and now they set up a confrontation [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=16.8s)]
*  between [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=20.88s)]
*  your National Guard and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Federal border troops now, I don't think either side of that equation wants to be enemies [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=24.759999999999998s)]
*  They're all on the same side, aren't they? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=31.0s)]
*  They are and as you pointed out and as border Patrol Council and Border Patrol members have made clear to Texas and to myself [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=35.16s)]
*  They want to have nothing to do with regard to tearing down that razor wire or tearing down the barriers that Texas has erected [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=43.72s)]
*  For one simple reason and that's because they are working border patrol says that what Texas has done to secure the border [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=50.16s)]
*  Actually makes their job even easier. The only [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=57.56s)]
*  Resistance we're facing is coming from Joe Biden [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=60.92s)]
*  Know this Sean and that is Joe Biden is in violation of federal law that already exists for one [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=64.28s)]
*  He is not living up to his duty to deny illegal entry across the border instead [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=70.4s)]
*  He's aiding that illegal entry. The second thing is he's not once people do cross the border [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  He is not detaining them [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=81.10000000000001s)]
*  He's as he's required by law and so he's giving mass parole across the country because Joe Biden is not enforcing the federal immigration laws [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=82.56s)]
*  That gives Texas the right under that article 1 section 10 of the Constitution [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=90.72s)]
*  To defend ourselves from imminent harm or from an invasion [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  Texas has every constitutional right in this case and I believe when the sun sets on this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=100.6s)]
*  Texas will be vindicated and the Constitution will be strengthened [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=106.68s)]
*  Yeah, you know that we have relevant US laws [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=111.12s)]
*  Joe Biden has been aiding and abetting in the law breaking Joe Biden not even go further [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=114.6s)]
*  He is he is violating the laws of this country [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=120.08s)]
*  He is violating his oath to uphold our Constitution [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=124.92s)]
*  I could put up on the screen all you know [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  title 8 USC [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=131.26s)]
*  1324 you know it prohibits alien smuggling domestic transportation [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=133.73999999999998s)]
*  You know it goes into you know every harboring illegal immigrants encouraging or inducing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=138.42s)]
*  Conspiracy aiding and abetting if I did any one of the things that Joe Biden is now [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=145.14s)]
*  Institutionalized I would be in jail and I doubt that the best lawyers in America could get me off the hook [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=150.54s)]
*  Well fair point [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=157.34s)]
*  But also you're making another profound point you listed all those different ways that the Biden administration has these duties and responsibilities [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=158.34s)]
*  Because they're not just doing that job poorly, but because they have totally abandoned doing that job whatsoever [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  That is exactly what gives Texas our constitutional right for Texas to be able to act [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=173.86s)]
*  So by Texas building the barriers that we have by us taking the action to repel illegal immigration [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=178.66s)]
*  We're fully authorized because the federal government has ceded or conceded the field of immigration enforcement [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=184.7s)]
*  And Texas has picked up that duty and we're the ones in self-enforcement [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=192.18s)]
*  And let me tell you this amazing number Sean [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  If you know where that park is where Texas now has taken over and we've blockaded that park that is an area where? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=198.42s)]
*  Sometimes over the past year there would be as many as two or three or more than that thousand people coming across the border a day [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=205.82s)]
*  Yesterday there were just six people crossing the border all six of those people were arrested by Texas law enforcement officers [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=213.06s)]
*  We have now cracked down and been able to staunch the flow of illegal immigration [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=222.06s)]
*  Biden should want this replicated across the entire border. That's what Texas is trying to do as we speak. I [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=226.86s)]
*  Gotta say one good thing your fellow Republican governors have been pretty amazing [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=234.22000000000003s)]
*  They've all come to your defense every one of them and they're offering guard troops [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=238.73999999999998s)]
*  They are offering razor wire. They're offering all the help [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  They understand that you have you're bearing the brunt of this, but they also understand that their states are also [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=246.42s)]
*  impacted by Joe Biden's open borders [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=253.5s)]
*  And these people are unvetted as I as I keep pointing out and and now Joe Biden's being encouraged to federalize [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=256.94s)]
*  Your national guard your state guard [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=263.97999999999996s)]
*  What's what happens if he tries that because he did have a deadline of Friday he hasn't done anything as usual, but [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=267.82s)]
*  What if that happens if he tries to do that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=275.82s)]
*  First of all, as you know, this is the number one issue in America Americans want a secure border [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=278.06s)]
*  If Joe Biden federalizes our national guard, that would be the biggest political blunder that he could make and that's why I think [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=283.58s)]
*  He will not do it that said of course [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=289.9s)]
*  I am prepared in the event that they do make such a blunder to make sure that Texas will be able to continue to secure our [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=291.9s)]
*  border I [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=298.9s)]
*  I don't I'm not even gonna ask you what your plan is because I don't want you to telegraph it to them [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=300.9s)]
*  But the fact that you have to you have a president that has been aiding and abetting nearly two [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=306.41999999999996s)]
*  We're now getting close to 10 million Joe Biden unvetted illegal immigrants in this country [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=311.02s)]
*  I can't think of a bigger danger you've heard from these former retired FBI, you know [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=316.02s)]
*  People in the in the upper echelon of the FBI warning that this is an invasion [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=322.02s)]
*  Warning that these are a lot of these people are you know? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=327.38s)]
*  Men that are of age that they could wage war on the country [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=332.42s)]
*  What are the odds that from these countries that they're coming from that they have radical associations with the United States? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=336.18s)]
*  They're coming from that they have radical associations and are setting up, you know sleeper cells here in America [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=342.62s)]
*  I would say the odds are a hundred percent myself. I hope I'm wrong [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=349.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, so and so Sean what you just said taps into the verb the words in article 1 section 10 clause 3 [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=353.78s)]
*  We're talking about imminent danger [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=361.29999999999995s)]
*  We are in imminent danger because as you rightfully point out these are facts and that is there are people who are known terrorists [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=363.14s)]
*  Who are coming across the border that pose an imminent danger whether it be in Texas or some other state? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=370.18s)]
*  They because Biden is not doing his job that fully authorizes the state of Texas to protect our state and our country [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=375.58s)]
*  from that imminent danger [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, governor. I applaud what you're doing. It's unfair that Texas has to go through this [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=385.90000000000003s)]
*  I am glad that your fellow Republican governors have all stepped up and they're offering you [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=390.54s)]
*  Assistance in any way they can [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=396.46s)]
*  That speaks volumes about them. I hope the United States [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=398.5s)]
*  Republicans, let me just say let me say thank you to my fellow governors half of America now is standing against the bad administration [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=402.53999999999996s)]
*  Also more than a majority of all the attorneys general across the country [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=410.34s)]
*  Biden is not taking on Texas Biden is taking on the United States of America [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=414.7s)]
*  Well said and you know what there should be consequences when a president picks and chooses the laws that he's going to enforce and he [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=418.86s)]
*  Doesn't get to break the law just because he doesn't like the law [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=426.02000000000004s)]
*  You've done a great job governor under very difficult circumstances and everybody's pulling for you down there. Hang in there [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBi1NFfEJXU&t=429.78000000000003s)]
