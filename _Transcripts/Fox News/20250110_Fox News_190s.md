# Body language expert decodes Trump and Obama’s chat
**Fox News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo)
*  Here now with body language expert Susan Constantine is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, I thought he was saying, I know you voted for me Barack, come on, admit it, you [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  can tell me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=8.2s)]
*  Nobody's, nobody will know. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  How did you interpret that exchange? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=11.44s)]
*  Because I've got to find out what happened. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=13.92s)]
*  I really do. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=16.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know, this was really interesting, Sean. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for bringing that up. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=20.78s)]
*  If you look at President Obama's hand gesture, you'll see his thumb kind of pointing out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=23.12s)]
*  This is what we call thumb shrug. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=27.7s)]
*  So he was asking a question and he was leaning in. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  You could see President Obama listening, but you could see these horizontal wrinkles across [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=33.54s)]
*  his forehead, his eyebrows were lifted, his mouth was turned down slightly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=38.82s)]
*  So what was happening is whatever Trump said to him, that what we're looking at is his [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=44.78s)]
*  exchange. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=52.3s)]
*  So there was something about that that upset him because that is what created those horizontal [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=53.3s)]
*  wrinkles. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=57.34s)]
*  So if that's what you had stated earlier, what was asked to him, that would make sense [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=58.34s)]
*  of what his, why he had that sort of reaction because he certainly didn't, he didn't, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=62.940000000000005s)]
*  there wasn't a positive exchange there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=71.58s)]
*  Now contrary to Trump and Obama, the greeting, if you want to call it that, between Kamala [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=72.78s)]
*  Harris and the Bidens, that kind of appeared to be anything but friendly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=77.7s)]
*  Let's look at this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  Wow, barely a hello. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  What do you, what do you make of that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is what we call stonewalling. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  When you don't want to make connection with someone, you block them off. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=108.62s)]
*  So there's no eye contact, there's no camaraderie between the two of them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  She's looking straight ahead. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  There's no, no, you know, interpersonal communication that's going on. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=117.38000000000001s)]
*  So this was definitely what we call stonewalling. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=124.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=125.42s)]
*  Now, Trump and Obama's conversation wasn't the only interaction that caused a stir online. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=126.42s)]
*  I don't know what to make of this, but take a look at how former president George W. Bush [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  greeted former president Obama. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=135.86s)]
*  You know, most people would shake hands. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=138.26s)]
*  Bush appeared to greet his successor, you know, by tapping him on the stomach. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=139.86s)]
*  Boom. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=145.34s)]
*  Here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=146.34s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=147.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=148.34s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think this is jousting. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=149.34s)]
*  I think that what's happening is that, you know, social media is blowing up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=151.66s)]
*  They think that there's some sort of anger issue that's going on. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=155.02s)]
*  Yes, it was a very quick tap. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=158.26s)]
*  But on the other hand, how often, Sean, have you seen a friend of yours out and you don't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=160.38s)]
*  have really have time to say hello, you don't want to embrace them, but you just kind of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=164.98s)]
*  tap and say, hey, buddy, how's it going? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=167.98s)]
*  It's a nonverbal cue. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  I think it's just a friendly tap, a jousting between the two of them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=171.17999999999998s)]
*  All right, Susan. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=174.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=176.62s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-edFPdfAo&t=177.62s)]
