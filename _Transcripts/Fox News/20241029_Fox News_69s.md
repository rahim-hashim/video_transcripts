# Trump says he has 'no idea' who MSG comedian is
**Fox News:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY)
*  So you have this big event at Madison Square Garden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=0.0s)]
*  It went on for hours. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  I don't even know if you were there for the whole thing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=4.04s)]
*  I don't know what time you got there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=6.3s)]
*  I was told and made aware that you had no idea about this [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=8.48s)]
*  comedian who made comments. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=12.56s)]
*  I still have no idea who he is. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=14.96s)]
*  Somebody said there was a comedian that joked about [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=17.72s)]
*  Puerto Rico or something. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=20.12s)]
*  And I have no idea who he was. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Never saw him, never heard of him, and don't [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=23.04s)]
*  want to hear of him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=25.72s)]
*  But I have no idea. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=26.72s)]
*  They put a comedian in, which everybody does. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=28.04s)]
*  You throw comedians in. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=30.08s)]
*  You don't vet them and go crazy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=31.28s)]
*  It's nobody's fault. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  But somebody said some bad things. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=35.32s)]
*  Now, what they've done is taken somebody that has nothing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=37.56s)]
*  to do with the party, has nothing to do with us, said [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=41.2s)]
*  something, and they try and make a big deal. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=43.76s)]
*  But I don't know who it is. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=45.8s)]
*  I don't even know who put him in. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=46.84s)]
*  And I can't imagine it's a big deal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=49.4s)]
*  I've done more for Puerto Rico than any president, I think, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=51.28s)]
*  that's ever been president. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pck95P-dMyY&t=54.0s)]
