# Josh Hawley gets Mark Zuckerberg to apologize
**Fox News:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM)
*  All right, a brutal day for big tech executives on Capitol Hill as they testified before the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=0.0s)]
*  Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on child safety with an audience of parents that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=5.32s)]
*  lost children to the many horrors of social media. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=10.74s)]
*  Lawmakers, they did not hold back with their questions, and they had particularly harsh [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  words for Meta CEO, and that would be Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=18.78s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=22.48s)]
*  Mr. Zuckerberg, you and the companies before us, I know you don't mean it to be so, but [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=24.04s)]
*  you have blood on your hands. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=29.62s)]
*  You have a product. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=31.82s)]
*  You have a product that's killing people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  Senator, my understanding is that we don't allow sexually explicit content on the service [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=37.980000000000004s)]
*  for people of any age. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=42.18s)]
*  The, the, um... [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=44.42s)]
*  How is that going? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=46.5s)]
*  Uh, you know, our, our, uh... [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=47.5s)]
*  These results may contain images of child sexual abuse. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=50.7s)]
*  And then you gave users two choices. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=54.78s)]
*  Get resources or see results anyway. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=58.32s)]
*  Mr. Zuckerberg, what the hell were you thinking? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=65.64s)]
*  In what sane universe is there a link for see results anyway? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=68.08s)]
*  Well, because we might be wrong. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=72.56s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=74.16s)]
*  There's families of victims here today. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=75.16s)]
*  Have you apologized to the victims? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=76.88s)]
*  Would you like to do so now? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=80.64s)]
*  Well, they're here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=81.92s)]
*  You're on national television. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=83.0s)]
*  Would you like now to apologize to the victims who have been harmed by your product? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=84.48s)]
*  Show them the pictures. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=88.2s)]
*  Would you like to apologize for what you've done to these good people? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=90.28s)]
*  I, I, I... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=93.12s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=94.12s)]
*  I think some of you have all been really terrible. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=95.12s)]
*  No one should have to go through the things that your families have, have suffered. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=96.12s)]
*  And this is why we invested so much and are going to continue doing these streaming efforts [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=97.12s)]
*  to, uh, to make sure that no one has to go through the things that your families have had to suffer. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=98.12s)]
*  It was more on today's report. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=105.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=106.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=107.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=108.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=109.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=110.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=111.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=112.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=113.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=114.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=115.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=116.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=117.12s)]
*  And the next speaker on today's hearing is Missouri Senator Josh Hawley. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=119.04s)]
*  Senator, good to see you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  Um, there are very specific scams and, and ways to entrap young people. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=122.28s)]
*  I don't think everybody in America is fully aware of this, sex extortion being one of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=128.72s)]
*  them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=133.4s)]
*  Uh, can you explain how dangerous this is and what is out there and the impact it's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=134.4s)]
*  having on kids so everyone really gets this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=139.08s)]
*  Oh, it's, it's having an incredible impact on kids, Sean. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=142.72s)]
*  And I mean, teenagers, listen, I'm the father of three kids. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=147.08s)]
*  None of them are teenagers yet, thank goodness. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=150.72s)]
*  But if you're a teen, I mean, here's some stats. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  Young girls, teenage girls between the ages of 13 and 15 on Instagram, 37% of them saw [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=155.44s)]
*  nudity on the platform, unwanted, sent to their accounts within the first seven days [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  of being on the platform. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=166.52s)]
*  25% of them within seven days, Sean, were propositioned sexually by an adult man. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, just think about this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  These are girls between ages of 13 and 15. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=176.04s)]
*  That data, by the way, comes from Facebook. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=179.48s)]
*  That's their own internal data. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  This is a company that has profited off of the exploitation of kids, the exploitation [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  of minors, and now it's time for them to pay up. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=189.64s)]
*  They need to set up a victim's compensation fund. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=192.12s)]
*  They need to pay these people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  The families ought to be able to sue them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  It was pretty powerful moment that you got Zuckerberg to stand up. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=198.04s)]
*  I wouldn't really call it maybe the most sincere apology. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=202.04s)]
*  And that's why we continue to do more to be the best at what we do, et cetera. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=206.48s)]
*  How is it possible, or is it even possible, that he doesn't know this is going on? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=211.44s)]
*  There's no way that they don't know, and there's no way that they haven't known for a long [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=217.0s)]
*  time. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=221.12s)]
*  Your committee has been all over them for a long time on this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=222.72s)]
*  Yeah, he absolutely knows what's going on, Sean. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=226.88s)]
*  The reason I know that is because we've had whistleblowers from Facebook come and testify [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=230.12s)]
*  under oath that they collected that kind of information I just shared with you and sent [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=234.56s)]
*  it to Zuckerberg personally, and he ignored it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=239.08s)]
*  So what he should have said to the families is, I'm so sorry for what we've done, and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=243.44s)]
*  we will do better. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=247.28s)]
*  And the way they're going to do better is they'll hold themselves accountable. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=248.8s)]
*  Listen, Mark Zuckerberg's worth $140 billion. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=251.48s)]
*  If he devoted just 10 percent of that to helping victims, think what he could do for these [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  families. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=261.36s)]
*  And, by the way, if he would actually change his platform and not allow pedophiles and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=262.36s)]
*  sex predators on there, he could do a service to every family in America. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=267.04s)]
*  I'll just say this, Sean, he seems to have all the time and attention in the world to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=270.36s)]
*  censor conservatives. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=274.0s)]
*  Facebook leapt at the opportunity to censor any questions about COVID, to label people [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  who had COVID vaccine questions as potential terrorists. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=280.56s)]
*  Of course, in the 100-byte laptop, they shut you down, but yet they can't lift a finger [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=286.16s)]
*  to take sex predators off their platform. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=290.32s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=292.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=293.32s)]
*  There's a lawsuit, Senator Graham, who said that Zuckerberg has blood on his hands, and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=294.32s)]
*  he referenced the South Carolina state rep who is suing Instagram after his 17-year-old [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=298.56s)]
*  son Gavin died by suicide after falling victim to an extortion group from Nigeria operating [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=304.32s)]
*  through a meta-owned app. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=311.6s)]
*  They threaten the young man that if you don't give them the money, that they would expose [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=313.56s)]
*  photos that I guess they kind of manipulated this kid into sending. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=317.2s)]
*  How common is this? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=322.32s)]
*  So parents really need to understand. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=323.48s)]
*  How common is this? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=325.56s)]
*  Your kids are on social media. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=327.32s)]
*  You know, all their friends are on social media. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=329.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=331.8s)]
*  But these things, there are predators out there that are doing these things to children, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=332.8s)]
*  and they think there's no way out like in this case except to, you know, obviously, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=338.4s)]
*  this kid saw no other way out. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=343.96s)]
*  He felt the real pressure of an extortion. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=346.17999999999995s)]
*  We'll get this, Sean. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  Just three years ago, the Center for Exploited and Missing Children that keeps track of these [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  statistics reported only about 100 cases of that kind of sextortion, it's called. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=356.67999999999995s)]
*  Last year, they reported over 20,000 of these cases online. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=362.32s)]
*  20,000. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=366.52s)]
*  And as a father, that strikes fear into my heart. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=367.64s)]
*  I know it does in the heart of every parent that's out there. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=369.84s)]
*  Here's another statistic. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=372.64s)]
*  The New Mexico attorney general did an investigation. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=374.08s)]
*  They found that a profile of a 13-year-old girl, it was only up for a day on Instagram [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=376.7s)]
*  before she had been added against her will to a group, a chat group that included pedophiles [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=382.4s)]
*  and other people who were propositioning her for sex. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=388.74s)]
*  Thirteen years old was her profile. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=391.2s)]
*  I mean, this stuff, it's outrageous. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=392.56s)]
*  Zuckerberg knows about it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=394.64s)]
*  He needs to be accountable for it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=396.0s)]
*  And they need to pay for it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=398.2s)]
*  And by the way, where's the FBI? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=399.2s)]
*  I know they're busy investigating moms and dads showing up at school board meetings as [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  domestic terrorists. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=404.76s)]
*  And I know they're busy going after peaceful protesters that are pro-life. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=406.56s)]
*  And I know they're busy warning Big Tech about a potential disinformation campaign [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=410.92s)]
*  that might have to do with Hunter and Joe Biden, which I believe played a part in the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=417.0s)]
*  2020 election. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=421.88s)]
*  You know, at what point do they get held accountable? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=422.88s)]
*  They have protections that other news organizations don't have because they're supposed to be [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  a platform. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=432.04s)]
*  But at what point does the responsibility lie with them to make sure that children on [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=433.44s)]
*  these sites are fully protected? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=438.6s)]
*  Well, number one, the responsibility should lie with the sites right now, with the platforms. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=442.92s)]
*  These are the biggest, richest companies in the world. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=447.32s)]
*  There's no reason they should be getting handouts from government in the form of special protections. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  You should be able to sue them. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=454.24s)]
*  If your kid gets propositioned online, if your kid gets sex abuse material, child porn, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=455.52s)]
*  pushed to them online, you ought to be able to stop that as a mom or dad, including by [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=461.44s)]
*  suing them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=465.32s)]
*  Number one. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=466.32s)]
*  Number two, as to the FBI, here's what the FBI was talking to Facebook about. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=467.32s)]
*  They were pressuring Facebook to take down posts about Hunter Biden. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=471.4s)]
*  They were pressuring Facebook to take down posts about the COVID vaccine, posts about [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=474.52s)]
*  election integrity. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=478.84s)]
*  That's where all their focus has been. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=479.84s)]
*  They're not focused on sex predators. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=481.08s)]
*  They're focused on suppressing speech. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=483.26s)]
*  And they've got it exactly backwards. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=485.24s)]
*  Sean, they need to be held accountable too. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=486.44s)]
*  And that starts with Chris Ray. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=488.04s)]
*  He's got to go. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=489.36s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=490.36s)]
*  He should be on the hook personally. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=491.36s)]
*  It's time to get these people actually focused on working for us, being responsible, doing [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=493.0s)]
*  the right thing. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=497.0s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=498.0s)]
*  These stories about what's happening to young kids is mind blowing. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=499.0s)]
*  Senator, great job today. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  Let's see if anything happens with that apology and what they're doing moving forward. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbLISUAXJzM&t=508.6s)]
