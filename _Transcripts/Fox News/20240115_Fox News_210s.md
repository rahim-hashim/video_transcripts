# Trump uniquely understands the American voter: Ari Fleischer
**Fox News:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4)
*  Ari, let me bring you into this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=0.0s)]
*  I've been saying a lot on the air that Donald Trump defies all conventional political gravity. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=2.44s)]
*  Usually you would think that if somebody gets arrested, if somebody gets indicted, that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=9.32s)]
*  their poll numbers would go down. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=13.32s)]
*  In every case, his has gone up. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=14.8s)]
*  And I wonder if it's been such overkill, because this started the day that he and Melania Trump [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=16.96s)]
*  came down that escalator, leading into, you know, three long years of what turned out [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=22.8s)]
*  to be nothing but lies and conspiracy theories, peddled by fake news CNN, MSNBC, The New York [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=27.36s)]
*  Times, Three Broadcast Network, The Washington Post. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=33.4s)]
*  They all seem to be wrong. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=36.56s)]
*  They all were wrong, rather. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  And I wonder if in some odd way they took a man like Donald Trump and they actually [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=39.76s)]
*  have turned him into a victim. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=46.46s)]
*  And people see through this, and none of what they now do matters to people because of all [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  the fundamental unfairness that led up to this point. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=54.6s)]
*  You know, Sean, we have gaps in this country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=57.56s)]
*  People say a gender gap. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=61.44s)]
*  There's this gap. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=62.56s)]
*  There's that gap. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=63.56s)]
*  The biggest gap we have is actually between the mainstream media and the American people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=64.56s)]
*  Specifically, college-educated Democrats who are really reporters, the mainstream media, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  ABC, NBC, CBS, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and their failure to understand the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=74.8s)]
*  outside, its elite bubbles, its cities, its college-educated campuses. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=80.68s)]
*  They do not understand the rural voters of Iowa. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  They will parachute in, interview them, talk about what these people believe in, and then [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  leave and not understand their way of life, their way of thinking, their way of being [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=92.48s)]
*  raised in a gun culture, their way of fishing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=97.04s)]
*  It is such a disparate group of people, but the majority, of course, are those type of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=99.72s)]
*  Americans who are not the college-educated Democrats, reporters. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=105.56s)]
*  And that's why they missed the story of 2016. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=109.72s)]
*  And that's why I think that you have still so many people cheering for the defeat of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=112.54s)]
*  Donald Trump who are out of touch with such a huge swath of this country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=116.4s)]
*  Donald Trump, to his credit, is intuitively in touch with them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=122.0s)]
*  And you're seeing that tonight on the ground in Iowa. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=126.36s)]
*  These results are really staggering if they hold up for President Trump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=128.8s)]
*  President is important. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=133.52s)]
*  History is important. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=134.52s)]
*  Donald Trump is shattering it this year with the margin of his victory. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  Even if he falls short of 50, his margin between first and second is massive. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  Now, for that second, because I do think it still is important, and we all need to recognize [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=143.88s)]
*  New Hampshire has a very different electoral makeup than Iowa does, far more college-educated, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=148.36s)]
*  far more moderate. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  That would play to Nikki Haley's benefit, you have to presume. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=156.28s)]
*  And if she wins in second in Iowa, it will boost her going to New Hampshire. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=159.56s)]
*  Haley's problem, though, based on the results tonight, is she's got to crack conservatives. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=163.76s)]
*  She cannot win on the basis of liberal, moderate Republicans alone with some help from independents. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=169.2s)]
*  She's got to do better among true blue conservatives. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=176.0s)]
*  And that's where, in Iowa at least, there's no evidence that anybody can run against Donald Trump. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=179.32s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=185.64s)]
*  I've always felt that the fact New Hampshire allows independents to decide whether they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=186.64s)]
*  prefer to vote in a Democratic primary or the Republican primary. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=192.32s)]
*  Ari, great analysis. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=195.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVVL17R9GU4&t=197.64s)]
