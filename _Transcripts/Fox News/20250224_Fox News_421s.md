# Vivek Ramaswamy shares vision for Ohio after announcing run for governor
**Fox News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4)
*  And earlier today Vivek Ramaswamy officially declared his candidacy for governor of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=0.0s)]
*  Buckeye State Ohio during a rally in Cincinnati. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=5.2s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=7.96s)]
*  We will lead Ohio to be the top state in the country, where we lead the way in the sectors [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=9.24s)]
*  of the future, from semiconductors to aerospace. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=14.6s)]
*  Look at where we are today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=18.1s)]
*  How about this company, guys? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=19.1s)]
*  Love this in the heart of Butler County, an aerospace company leading us to the future, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=20.1s)]
*  all the way to AI and the other sectors of our future. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  I will lead Ohio to be the top state in the country, where patriots across America actually [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  flock to instead of Florida and Texas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=34.48s)]
*  I will lead Ohio to be the state of excellence in America. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  All right, Vivek Ramaswamy joins us now with more. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=42.72s)]
*  His first interview since announcing his run. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=46.64s)]
*  Oh, look, you already have the crowd behind you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=50.32s)]
*  Hello to everybody there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=51.32s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=53.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=54.08s)]
*  They're good, Sean. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=55.08s)]
*  They can't hear you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=56.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=57.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=58.08s)]
*  You had me in the speech until you went after my state of Florida and said you're going [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=59.08s)]
*  to bury Florida and Ohio is going to be beating Florida. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  You had me up to that point because I'm pretty competitive. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=68.36s)]
*  Tell us about what's going on. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=71.88s)]
*  Look, I think it's a little friendly competition between our states is a good thing, Sean. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=73.92s)]
*  That's what federalism was built on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=78.92s)]
*  I do want to lead Ohio to be the top state in the country, especially in one area that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=80.78s)]
*  I don't think we've talked about enough, which is educational excellence, even in our public [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=85.12s)]
*  schools. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=89.92s)]
*  I want to make Ohio the first state in the country where we implement merit based pay [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=90.92s)]
*  for teachers, principals, superintendents so that the best teachers who should be paid [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=95.48s)]
*  more are actually paid more. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=100.4s)]
*  But that comes at the expense of a lot of dead weight hanging around. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=102.62s)]
*  I want to get the cell phones out of the classroom. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=106.12s)]
*  I want to bring back early physical education. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=108.0s)]
*  Educational excellence, I think, is a core theme, especially as it relates to the achievement [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=110.84s)]
*  of our kids, Sean. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=114.64s)]
*  And that's something we talked about tonight. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=115.64s)]
*  You know, the number one public schools in the country know what state it is, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=117.64s)]
*  Well, right now it is absolutely not Ohio. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=123.44s)]
*  But I do think that we have to lead to the future we want to get to. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=125.88s)]
*  And look, I think that take a look at the entire country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=129.68s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump was elected in a decisive mandate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=132.24s)]
*  He's reviving our confidence in America. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=136.44s)]
*  I think we need a leader here at home, Sean, who revives our conviction in Ohio. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=139.16s)]
*  Donald Trump was the greatest president we've had in our 21st century. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=143.48s)]
*  Now we need governors across the country who rise to that same occasion and lead at the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=147.28s)]
*  state level. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=152.04s)]
*  When you think about programs in health care or education, what they're doing to the federal [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=153.04s)]
*  bureaucracy is beautiful. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=156.64s)]
*  But a lot of those programs are now going to move to the states and to the people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  So I do think now is a moment where we're going to require strong willed governors to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=162.3s)]
*  lead the way. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=166.4s)]
*  And I'm excited to lead the charge here in Ohio. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=167.4s)]
*  I will tell you, your passion is infectious by every measure. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=170.04s)]
*  I will tell you it is sad what has happened to the educational system in this country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=176.48s)]
*  And yeah, I'm all in favor of getting rid of the Department of Education. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=182.64s)]
*  I'm all in favor of either vouchers or block granting the money to states. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=185.84s)]
*  I believe local officials will do better. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=189.76s)]
*  Parents would make better choices than somebody at the federal level. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=191.92s)]
*  It's such a shame that we pay more per capita per child on education and we get the worst [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=197.8s)]
*  results in the entire industrialized world. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  And when I hear you passionately say you're going to fix that in Ohio and fix the issue [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=205.8s)]
*  of law and order and become a hub for business and innovation and technology, to me it's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=211.0s)]
*  just basic common sense. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=219.12s)]
*  That's why Florida does well. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=220.84s)]
*  That's why Texas does well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  That's why a lot of Republican governors have been doing well. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=223.4s)]
*  And I like the competition as well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=226.9s)]
*  I want to see Ohio do well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=228.62s)]
*  I want every state to do well. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=233.02s)]
*  And that's how our country works at its best, Sean. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=234.3s)]
*  These are time-tested principles. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=236.66s)]
*  Smaller government, put the money back in the pockets of the people who actually live here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=238.18s)]
*  Transparency for the taxpayer. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=242.86s)]
*  I want everybody in Ohio to see how their money is actually being spent from the state [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=244.86s)]
*  level to the local level to bring sunlight as the best disinfectant. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=248.94s)]
*  And I just think that we live in a special moment in our country. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=253.22s)]
*  I'm as optimistic as I've ever been for our future now with President Trump in office. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=256.66s)]
*  But we've got to take that agenda now to the next level. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=261.66s)]
*  We've got to carry that forward to the future. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=264.7s)]
*  Shutting down the Department of Education is a great first step. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  But then we have to stand for the achievement and education of our students in math, where [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=269.62s)]
*  75 percent of eighth graders aren't proficient in math according to international standards. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=273.82s)]
*  There's kids in other countries where English isn't even their first language, doing better [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=278.46s)]
*  on English proficiency than our own kids here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=283.38s)]
*  That's unacceptable to me, Sean, as an Ohioan, as an American, as a parent. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=286.66s)]
*  But the good news is we're going to step up and actually fix it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=291.38s)]
*  I don't want to just curse the darkness. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=294.14s)]
*  We're actually going to actually drive that positive change through action in our state. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  And I believe our country's best days are ahead of us. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=301.1s)]
*  And I would like Ohio as a state that led the first industrial revolution to be a state [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=303.78000000000003s)]
*  whose best days are ahead as well. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=308.6s)]
*  And economically speaking, I think it's something you'll understand, Sean, if Silicon Valley [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=310.94s)]
*  led the way in the American economy for the last 10 years, I want to make sure it is the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=314.88s)]
*  Ohio River Valley for the next 10 years in the sectors of the future. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=319.46s)]
*  And that's where I'm going to lead us. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=324.48s)]
*  How do you incentivize businesses to invest all that money? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=326.42s)]
*  I mean, listen, Texas had a really big win. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=329.34s)]
*  And I don't think if Donald Trump lost this election that Apple would be investing $500 [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=331.58s)]
*  and committing $500 billion in four years and building a plant in Texas and creating [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=338.06s)]
*  tens of thousands of jobs. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=342.66s)]
*  I think they got the message loud and clear, bring manufacturing back to this country, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=344.62s)]
*  create high paying career jobs for Americans. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=349.66s)]
*  And that's all we really want, free and fair trade with our partners. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=352.86s)]
*  We don't want to be stepped on by our partners. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=356.1s)]
*  And they've taken advantage of us. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=360.5s)]
*  And we let them do it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  And they have not been held accountable for it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=363.5s)]
*  Well, President Trump is holding them accountable for unfair practices. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=366.34s)]
*  And he's also leading the way federally. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=370.54s)]
*  What he really needs is partners at the states who can actually do the same thing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=372.82s)]
*  So you asked about economic spring, economic innovation. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=375.54s)]
*  President Trump's doing his part. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=378.8s)]
*  But we need to make states like Ohio zero income tax states, bring down the property [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=379.8s)]
*  taxes, cut the regulatory burden, slash the red tape, bring down the permitting timelines [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=384.14s)]
*  for energy dominance and manufacturing dominance. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=388.64s)]
*  So we're going to do our part. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=391.14s)]
*  Ohio hopefully sets a standard for the rest of the country. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=392.82s)]
*  And I'm excited for what we're going to be able to achieve by moving our state and our [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=395.85999999999996s)]
*  country forward. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=398.82s)]
*  I'm just going to warn whoever you end up debating, be it in the primary or the general, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=399.82s)]
*  good luck. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=405.26s)]
*  I've been there myself. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=406.26s)]
*  Vivek, congratulations. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVfroCXVo4&t=408.05999999999995s)]
