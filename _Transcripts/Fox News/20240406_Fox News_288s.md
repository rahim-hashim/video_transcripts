# Victor Davis Hanson: Democratic forces are likely to 'bust up' the party's convention
**Fox News:** [April 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ)
*  All right, here now with more on his column on the 11 ways Biden and his handlers are hell bent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  on destroying America from the Hoover Institute. The great Victor Davis Hanson. Sir, great to have [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=6.16s)]
*  you. First, before I get to your column, which we went into detail in our opening monologue, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=12.24s)]
*  well written as always, well thought out as well. Is there a VP choice you'd recommend? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=17.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, I have, I think Yonkin would be good. I think Landa Santas would be wonderful. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=22.88s)]
*  And I, I like Marco Rubio. He's got a lot of experience and he's well spoken. So all three [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=31.36s)]
*  of them are my top three candidates. Okay, fair enough. I read your column and it just intrigued [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=36.56s)]
*  me. I just free associate not only on the 11 items specifically, but on the impact this is [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=44.16s)]
*  having on the country. And God forbid if this guy got reelected, what the world would look like and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=53.36s)]
*  what our country would look like and the damage that would be probably irreparable harm in my view [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=60.08s)]
*  would be the result of that. Well, I think people are upset because these are no longer abstractions. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=66.0s)]
*  Affecting you when you go to the store, you're paying 40% more for food. You've got people in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  your community. You don't know even have any idea where they're from or what they're doing here [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=79.2s)]
*  or what they intend with an open border. Abroad, we have this war in Ukraine. We've got the war [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=83.52s)]
*  in Gaza. We've lost deterrent. So, and then what's really, I think the most dangerous, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=89.04s)]
*  Stephen Miller touched on it, but he's involved in foreign countries, Sean. We're trying to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=94.56s)]
*  overthrow basically the government, the elected government of Israel. And that was, we used to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=99.36s)]
*  make fun of the ugly American that intervened in Latin America in the 1950s, but this administration [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=105.2s)]
*  for cheap political gain is trying to destroy the Netanyahu government. All of a sudden, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=111.68s)]
*  Obador for some reason after he tried to blackmail us and wanted 20 billion and he hates Trump and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=117.12s)]
*  prefers Biden, suddenly now this week he says he's going to patrol the border and help [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=123.28s)]
*  Joe Biden out. And then when you get into and getting the price of gas down, not only is he [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=128.8s)]
*  not going to fill up the petroleum reserve, but he's actually told the Ukrainians, we don't want [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  you to go after targets in Russia that involve petroleum because he doesn't want the price to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  go up. So he's willing to mortgage our national security for his own reelection in ways that have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=147.12s)]
*  been so blatant and flagrant. We've never seen anything like that before. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=152.72s)]
*  So every poll is showing that Americans see his steep cognitive decline. Every poll is showing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  that the American people, they seem to be getting it on the issue of the economy. I think every [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=164.64s)]
*  American is watching the border and it's showing up in every exit poll and where in every primary [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=171.2s)]
*  state as the number one issue on people's minds. I think they realize it's become a disaster. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=177.04s)]
*  So with that record of failure, I guess the only thing that he has to run on is I hate Donald Trump, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=182.88s)]
*  I hate Donald Trump, if the dog bites, if the bee stings, if you're feeling sad, blame Donald Trump. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Does that work? Is that enough for him, especially when his base is eroding the way it is? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=198.96s)]
*  Well, he's trying to translate what you just said into reality and that is trying to physically, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=205.44s)]
*  mentally, financially break down Trump with these surrogate lawsuits. He really does believe [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=211.44s)]
*  that a Jack Smith or a Fannie Willis or an Alvin Bragg or Letita James will either cost Trump so [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=218.24s)]
*  many millions in legal fees or penalties he won't be able to campaign effectively or he'll [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=223.84s)]
*  be able to campaign effectively or he'll put gag orders on him or he'll put him in jail. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  Barring that, I don't think it's going to work. I think the Chicago [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=237.68s)]
*  convention is going to be the most loud, violent, scary convention, the Democratic convention in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=240.96s)]
*  Chicago in August because there's going to be a lot of people who come to the conclusion [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  that his family is corrupt, he's declining mentally and physically and all of his agenda, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=252.0s)]
*  every item of it is unpopular. So I think there's still going to be a movement among some of the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=259.28s)]
*  Democratic party to bust up that convention and it's going to be something to watch. It really is. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be something. I hope everyone reads your column. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=270.96s)]
*  Victor Davis Hanson. Thank you, sir. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqHcUDNKQQ&t=273.91999999999996s)]
