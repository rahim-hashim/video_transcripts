# This trial is a travesty: Sen. Ted Cruz
**Fox News:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o)
*  With more on all of this and the latest in Trump's legal saga in New York, Texas Senator [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=0.0s)]
*  Cruz, Alabama Senator Britt, welcome back both of you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=4.58s)]
*  Senator Cruz, I guess we'll ask, you know, considering you are Professor Dershowitz's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=8.0s)]
*  greatest student of all time, your reaction to what's going on in New York? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=13.0s)]
*  Oh, look, the trial is an absolute travesty. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=16.56s)]
*  I would say it is a circus show, but that's showing disrespect to circuses. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=20.0s)]
*  At this point, you have a wildly partisan left-wing Democrat prosecutor whose only objective [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=25.08s)]
*  is to get Donald Trump and to stop the voters from reelecting him in November. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  You have a wildly partisan left-wing judge whose only objective is to get Donald Trump [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=34.3s)]
*  and stop the voters from voting for him in November. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=38.22s)]
*  And you have a complete mess of a trial where they haven't demonstrated any violation [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=41.7s)]
*  of the law whatsoever, except actually yesterday they finally, finally, finally proved a crime [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=45.9s)]
*  when Michael Cohen admitted on the stand that he stole tens of thousands of dollars from [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=52.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  So we have a crime. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Their star witness is the criminal and he pleaded guilty to felony theft. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  That's the only crime that's been proven. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  And it is the most blatant example. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=65.3s)]
*  This prosecution and the other three are the most blatant example of election interference [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=67.64s)]
*  we have ever seen in the history of the country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  And they knew about the crime and they never charged Michael Cohen with the crime. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  And according to Bob Costell, they had exculpatory evidence. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=78.28s)]
*  They didn't present that to the grand jury either. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=81.52s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  Senator Britt, let's go to this IVF issue and how important it is to so many families [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  and talk about the legislation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=90.16s)]
*  Yeah, well first, obviously watching the political prosecution of Donald Trump is a travesty. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=92.64s)]
*  But speaking of him, he has been a huge champion of IVF. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=99.6s)]
*  He stood firmly with IVF and with families, opportunities to bring life into this world. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=103.64s)]
*  So this legislation, after what happened in Alabama and the court ruling, created a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=109.88s)]
*  lot of confusion and uncertainty. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=114.88s)]
*  And there on the ground, I could feel moms and dads who wanted to bring life into this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=117.44s)]
*  world, people who had children because of the miracle of life that they had got to use [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  through IVF, were concerned and they were fearful that that was going to be taken away. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=129.44s)]
*  So what this piece of legislation does is it says that we are going to protect IVF and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=134.6s)]
*  that way none of these families have to worry about that in the future. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=140.4s)]
*  And we believe that the Republican Party is the party of life. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=144.68s)]
*  We're the party of families. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=147.88s)]
*  We're the party of opportunity. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=149.24s)]
*  And this will just ensure that we continue to be able to do that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=151.12s)]
*  Yeah, and President Trump supports you with Senator Cruz. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=154.24s)]
*  Well, look, I think this is incredibly important legislation. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=157.68s)]
*  IVF is truly a medical miracle. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=162.68s)]
*  Right now today in the United States, 2 percent of all births in America come from IVF. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=165.28s)]
*  There have been over 8 million babies that have been born through the technology of IVF. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=170.16s)]
*  You know, Katie and I both have many, many friends and family members who had children [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=175.24s)]
*  only because of the great blessings of IVF. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=180.56s)]
*  As you know, Sean, I do a podcast every week, Verdict with Ted Cruz. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=183.72s)]
*  My co-host, Ben Ferguson, all three of his kids came through IVF. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=186.96s)]
*  Katie and I yesterday did Megyn Kelly's podcast. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  Megyn's kids came through IVF. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=195.52s)]
*  It is an incredible technology. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=198.44s)]
*  And following the Alabama Supreme Court, many people were understandably concerned, concerned [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=201.12s)]
*  that this medical science that they're relying on to become parents, to bring children into [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=206.4s)]
*  the world, to raise and to love, was in jeopardy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, there was a lot of partisan disinformation. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=214.92s)]
*  The Democrats are trying to convince people IVF is in jeopardy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=217.72s)]
*  The corporate media is helping with this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=221.2s)]
*  And Katie and I decided, let's introduce legislation to make absolutely clear at the federal law [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=223.68s)]
*  that IVF will be protected, that you have a federal right to access that technology. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=228.76s)]
*  I think this is legislation that on the merits should unify everyone. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=233.72s)]
*  Of 100 senators, I don't know a single senator who opposes IVF. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=238.28s)]
*  So we ought to come together and make it clear in federal law that your right to make this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  decision is going to be protected. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=246.88s)]
*  Well, I support both of you and the legislation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  And like both of you, I have friends that have had children and are trying today to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=252.76s)]
*  have children using this process. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=257.08s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=259.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YXWUoHt6_o&t=260.48s)]
