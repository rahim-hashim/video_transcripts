# Tammy Bruce: It will take generations to repair this damage
**Fox News:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c)
*  All right, tonight still no word on just who Trump will tap to be his running mate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=0.0s)]
*  And while it's unlikely that former Ambassador Nikki Haley is in the running after a contentious [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=5.44s)]
*  primary, Trump and Haley are now both working to unite the Republican Party. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=10.64s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Nikki Haley said today that she's going to vote for you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  It looks like the Republican Party is coming together. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=22.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it is coming together. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=24.28s)]
*  I think it's come together for a long time. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=26.8s)]
*  You have to understand, we did the nomination process the fastest in history. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=28.84s)]
*  You know, if somebody else were running, they'd still be running for another month in order [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=33.72s)]
*  to get the nominee. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=38.6s)]
*  We did it two months ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=39.6s)]
*  I believe the party is together. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=40.6s)]
*  I appreciate what she said. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=41.92s)]
*  The party is together and I think we're going to have a tremendous victory. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=43.56s)]
*  We saw it earlier. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=46.44s)]
*  Joining us now with reaction Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce and the Tudor Dixon podcast host [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=49.24s)]
*  aptly named after Tudor Dixon. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us on Hannity tonight. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=58.16s)]
*  Tammy, let's go to you first. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=61.6s)]
*  Pretty magnanimous of both of them to kind of throw their differences aside and say, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=63.64s)]
*  hey, we're going to vote in support Donald Trump. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=68.4s)]
*  And I thought Donald Trump was very magnanimous back to Haley, to Nikki Haley for doing that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=70.6s)]
*  Yeah, this has always been an all hands on deck endeavor. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=76.44s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=82.08s)]
*  There's been a recognition and President Trump's doing what he's doing and they're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=83.56s)]
*  trying to destroy his life. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=87.8s)]
*  He keeps doing it anyway because it's not about him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=88.8s)]
*  He actually knows this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=92.68s)]
*  He's standing up, obviously, for everyone else, for America, in order to make this work [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=94.76s)]
*  with the damage that has been inflicted, Jason, over the last several years and with what's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=100.76s)]
*  been revealed over the last few years about the nature of the bureaucracy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=105.92s)]
*  Trump needs everybody on deck. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=110.4s)]
*  The talent bench for the GOP is deep. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=112.84s)]
*  And I also like Nikki Haley. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=115.68s)]
*  And I appreciate ambition. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=118.08s)]
*  She's an ambitious woman. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=119.76s)]
*  The founders knew that it was—well, they cast it as ambitious men. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  And it's really ambitious people who saved this nation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=127.12s)]
*  So—but he also needs people in the closest realm whom he can trust, because we've also [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  seen with the betrayal, the lack of decorum and appreciation for him and certain other [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=136.96s)]
*  staff members over the years. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=144.72s)]
*  So, considering the nation's at stake, it's got to be people around him who understand [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=146.72s)]
*  the American people, why we are choosing him, the job that he's got to get done that only [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  he can do. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=158.04s)]
*  But he needs the support of a team. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=159.44s)]
*  And I think Haley understands that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  Where she would land, I don't know. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  Ron DeSantis is in the same boat, right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  You've got a lot of great personalities. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=169.2s)]
*  But it's about the team that makes us work, understanding the importance and the power [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=172.24s)]
*  and the value of Donald Trump in this unique period of time. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=177.44s)]
*  And then we can start thinking about 28 and 32 and all those other things. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=182.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=187.92s)]
*  It's going to take generations to repair this damage. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=188.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=191.32s)]
*  Tudor, I thought Nikki Haley, her timing was good. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=192.32s)]
*  She did make a national pledge that she would support the Republican nominee and she followed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=197.22s)]
*  through on that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=203.62s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=205.62s)]
*  I think it was perfect timing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=206.62s)]
*  She needed some time to show that she really wanted to think about what happened, talk [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=208.1s)]
*  to her donors and talk to her supporters. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=212.3s)]
*  All of the people that came to those rallies, she needed to give them time also to heal [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=215.06s)]
*  from that and decide that they were also going to come and bring the party together. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=219.42s)]
*  I think in addition to that, she gave the Democrats time to believe that they could [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=224.58s)]
*  take her supporters. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=230.3s)]
*  And I think that was very key to make sure that for a while they believed they had a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=231.78s)]
*  chance and she allowed those polls to creep up and creep up for Donald Trump. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=236.82s)]
*  And just, I believe at the right moment, she came out and said, he's my guy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=241.5s)]
*  You guys pretty much always knew he was going to be my guy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=245.76s)]
*  When I stepped out of the race, you knew I was going to vote Republican. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=248.3s)]
*  But now I'm coming out as he is high in the polls and Democrats are wondering what they're [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=251.46s)]
*  going to do to say, I'm voting with him and I'm going to take my supporters with me. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=255.78s)]
*  So the job of anybody running for office is to expand the tent, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=262.7s)]
*  To go out and get those independent voters and voters that would have voted on the other [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=269.26s)]
*  side of the aisle, maybe for somebody else. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=273.9s)]
*  The game we have now is trying to guess who the vice presidential pick is going to be [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=277.82s)]
*  because Donald Trump said he's probably going to do that at the convention. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=282.02s)]
*  That's less than two months away. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=285.74s)]
*  So what's your best bet for each of you? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  What's your guess? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=290.66s)]
*  Who should Donald Trump pick for his vice president? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=291.82s)]
*  Tammy, go first, please. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=294.02s)]
*  Well, you know, I've always thought the best team was Trump and DeSantis. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=296.02s)]
*  We saw with the governor that he wasn't quite sure about how to handle a national [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=302.26s)]
*  campaign that tells you that there is something that will—there's a few things to learn [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=306.94s)]
*  before you become president. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  Being in that vice presidency would help him understand that what's happening to Trump [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=314.58s)]
*  isn't just for Trump, that this is, again, about teamwork, but it's also about the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=318.73999999999995s)]
*  power of a personality. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=323.38s)]
*  He's young, he's in his 40s. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=325.02s)]
*  I think that that is an excellent position for him. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=327.34s)]
*  At the same time, you've got—still, you've got to make sure that people understand—and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=330.78s)]
*  that's the problem with Nikki. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=335.34s)]
*  She didn't necessarily understand what American—what the American people were thinking [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=336.82s)]
*  and doing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  But I think DeSantis should be the choice. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  But there's plenty of others, and I'll be thrilled with whoever he picks. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=343.74s)]
*  All right, Tudor, you're up. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=347.74s)]
*  Who's your best bet? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=350.54s)]
*  You know, I agree. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  I actually don't think that it's that important. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  I think the people that he is looking at right now, the lists that have been leaked, if they [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=357.26s)]
*  are accurate, all of those people would make a great vice president and would be able to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=361.02s)]
*  step into that position if need be. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=365.74s)]
*  They would be a fabulous pair, but Donald Trump doesn't need to come out with a vice [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=368.34s)]
*  presidential pick to get people to come onto his team and to vote for him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=373.53999999999996s)]
*  People are coming out for Donald Trump. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=377.82s)]
*  Very true. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=379.78s)]
*  So as much as we talk about the vice presidency, it's really about him, and no one is going [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=380.78s)]
*  to help him or hurt him. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=385.26s)]
*  He's going to carry that person through. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=387.14s)]
*  Well, I think those are—I agree with both of you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=390.74s)]
*  I think there's a lot of good people out there, Governor DeSantis, Senator Tim Scott, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=393.78s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio, John Radcliffe, the former congressman, Robert O'Brien, the former national [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=398.82s)]
*  security adviser. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=403.86s)]
*  But the best analysis I heard so far is that Dr. Ben Carson, because he probably doesn't [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=405.46s)]
*  want to become the next president, even though he's highly qualified, he won't be trying [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=410.98s)]
*  to run while he's in office for four years as the vice president. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=415.09999999999997s)]
*  That's an interesting thing, and I'm sure we'll talk a lot more about that on-hand. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=419.58s)]
*  Tammy Bruce, Tudor Dixon, thank you so much. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA9iLFd3V8c&t=423.38s)]
