# Vivek Ramaswamy: This sets up for potentially a major victory
**Fox News:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw)
*  All right, following the massive rally in deep blue New Jersey Saturday night, a new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=0.0s)]
*  set of swing state polls conducted by The New York Times released yesterday, well, spells [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=5.12s)]
*  even more trouble for Biden. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=10.08s)]
*  According to this survey, Trump is ahead by seven in Arizona, 10 in Georgia, seven in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Michigan, 12 in Nevada and three in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=17.52s)]
*  These are all states. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=21.32s)]
*  Joe Biden won in 2020. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=22.32s)]
*  And now, according to this new poll, well, most of them are not even close. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=23.84s)]
*  Trump isn't content there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  Apparently, reportedly now has said that he's going to compete in deep blue states like [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=30.04s)]
*  New York and New Jersey. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=35.48s)]
*  But recent polls show he may be right. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=37.64s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=40.2s)]
*  Remember, in 2020, Trump lost the state of New Jersey by 16 points and New York by 23 points. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=41.2s)]
*  Well, anyway, if you look in New Jersey, he's now picked up 13 points in New, I'm sorry, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=48.44s)]
*  he picked up 13 points and 11 in New Jersey. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=55.88s)]
*  That's a double digits of a swing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=58.96s)]
*  This poll from Emerson College found him down just seven points in New Jersey. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  And the new Seattle poll last month showed Biden's lead in New York just down to 10. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  Can he win? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  I don't know, but it's certainly fun to look at. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, Biden is allegedly in complete denial about polling and the polling crisis he's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  facing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=78.60000000000001s)]
*  As sources now say, neither he nor his advisors, they don't believe these numbers that they're [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  seeing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=84.0s)]
*  If you look at his recent struggles, well, it's kind of easy to understand why he's faltering. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=85.48s)]
*  You take a look at your very weak, frail, cognitively struggling mess of a president [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=89.92s)]
*  just earlier tonight. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=94.52s)]
*  You can't make it up. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=95.52s)]
*  During today's press briefing, Peter Ducey grilled Corrine Jean-Pierre on Biden's disastrous [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=96.52s)]
*  poll numbers. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  Why do you think Americans are so down on President Biden right now? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  I know you don't like to talk about polls like the 516 swing states that he is losing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=125.64s)]
*  right now to somebody who is a criminal offender. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=132.68s)]
*  But more broadly, it doesn't seem like anything you guys are doing is making him more popular. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=136.52s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=142.28s)]
*  I get that you understand that people are hurting right now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=143.96s)]
*  Why is it that nothing you're doing to address their concerns is working? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=146.52s)]
*  What I'm saying is we're going to continue to do the work. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=151.32s)]
*  I can't speak to the polls, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=154.74s)]
*  Those are for folks who are experts who can do a deep dive and look into that and speak [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=157.02s)]
*  to them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=161.66s)]
*  I have no answer. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=162.66s)]
*  There you go. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=164.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, as Trump spent yet another day stuck in a New York City courtroom for a sham [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=165.66s)]
*  trial, the former president's allies joined him and rallied to his defense, while the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=170.66s)]
*  left can barely contain their excitement over this latest Trump witch hunt. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  Democrats should be careful what they wish for. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  Remember Bill Clinton? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  Remember? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  They impeached him in 1998. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  Remember what happened to his approval rating? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it went up from the mid-60s to the low 70s. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  Here with reaction, former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=194.9s)]
*  He was with President Trump in the courtroom today. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=198.56s)]
*  If you look at the Russia hoax, impeachment one, impeachment two, the January 6th, all [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=201.78s)]
*  the exculpatory information withheld in there, Hollywood primetime extravaganza they put on [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=207.58s)]
*  before the nation, now missing documents, which is interesting, and all these indictments [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=213.38s)]
*  and all these arraignments, what happens? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=220.06s)]
*  Donald Trump's numbers go up. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=222.94s)]
*  Look at what happened with Bill Clinton. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=227.46s)]
*  Well, look, I think the American people understand, Sean, that this is not some usual election [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=229.46s)]
*  about the tax rate being 1% higher or 1% lower. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=234.82s)]
*  This is about the basic rules of the road. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=238.46s)]
*  And I think many Democrats and many independents across this country understand watching this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=240.9s)]
*  trial that this is a political sham. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  And if our justice system is politicized, we don't have a country left. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=248.02s)]
*  And so I think many Americans understand the urgency of that, to say that I don't care [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=251.8s)]
*  what your partisan affiliation is, our justice system should not be politicized. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=256.04s)]
*  That's what I saw in that courtroom tonight. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=260.42s)]
*  I think that's what Americans across this country see. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=262.06s)]
*  I'll tell you, I was riding the streets of New York City. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=264.26s)]
*  I was riding with President Trump back uptown. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=266.06s)]
*  The throngs of people standing on that street, having lived in Manhattan at an earlier stage [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=268.34s)]
*  in my life, I could never imagine seeing something like that as we're seeing today. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=272.41999999999996s)]
*  This sets up for potentially a major victory this November, Sean. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=277.52s)]
*  And not only is that good because it'll put President Trump back in the White House and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  win Senate majorities and House majorities, but it will also unite this country to say, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=284.46s)]
*  once and for all, we are a nation that believes in free speech, that believes in equal rights [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=289.34s)]
*  and a justice system. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=293.55999999999995s)]
*  We might debate on tax rates in the future, but this is about the foundational rules of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=294.86s)]
*  the road, and that's what many Americans see. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  I think they overreached, and I think it's backfiring. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=302.26s)]
*  Let's get your thoughts on what you saw in the courtroom today. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=305.72s)]
*  Well, what I saw in the courtroom is, first of all, that is one of the most depressing [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=308.38s)]
*  places I have been. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=312.74s)]
*  The only thing more depressing than the atmosphere of that courtroom is the content of what's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=314.3s)]
*  happening inside of it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, coming into today, Sean, one of the open questions that nobody has answered is, what [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  exactly is the crime that Donald J. Trump committed that he's being prosecuted for? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=324.36s)]
*  Nobody could give a clear answer to that question. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=329.3s)]
*  After today's testimony from Michael Cohen, that answer to that question is less clear [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=331.62s)]
*  than it has ever been. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=336.76s)]
*  You want to talk about falsifying business records? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=337.76s)]
*  Michael Cohen says he did so. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=340.32s)]
*  There is no evidence of any crime committed by Donald Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=342.06s)]
*  Now, if you look at the prosecution's entire theory of the case, think about this. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=344.64s)]
*  They're claiming that he should have used campaign funds for a personal payment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=349.12s)]
*  Had he done that, they would be prosecuting him for that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=353.98s)]
*  So they were going to get him going or they were going to get him coming. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=357.06s)]
*  And that is the best proof that this is a politicized persecution. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=359.70000000000005s)]
*  Think about this, Sean. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  One of the things they pressed Michael Cohen on is whether or not this was to advance voters' [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  impressions of Donald Trump. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, many politicians buy a better suit. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=369.5s)]
*  Many politicians go get a haircut. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=372.22s)]
*  They use their personal funds to do those things. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=373.94s)]
*  In fact, they have even pressed charges against candidates for using campaign funds illegally. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  So if Donald Trump would have been the exact opposite thing and still been charged for [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=382.06s)]
*  it, that proves this whole thing is a sham. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=386.38s)]
*  And I think that this case is done. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=389.62s)]
*  I think Judge Merchant should deliver a directed verdict to the jury to end this trial and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=391.22s)]
*  restore some trust in our judicial system. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=395.82s)]
*  That's where we are today. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=398.58s)]
*  And I do think that being there in person, I sensed some skepticism looking at the people [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=399.58s)]
*  in that room. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=404.12s)]
*  And I am hopeful that's going to lead to the right outcome in this case. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=405.12s)]
*  There's no way that directed verdict is coming. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=408.7s)]
*  No way. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=410.7s)]
*  Take confidence in this. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=412.34s)]
*  And we just showed the tape of Joe Biden waving at nobody and barely able to walk. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=413.34s)]
*  But he's going to be delivering, you know, an economic speech about Bidenomics and having [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  fundraisers with George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and hoping that they and Obama and the Clintons [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=425.24s)]
*  can save his campaign. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=431.18s)]
*  Can they? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=432.68s)]
*  No. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=433.68s)]
*  And here's the economic speech that he should be giving, right? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=434.68s)]
*  Because Americans understand this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=438.06s)]
*  Prices have gone up. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=439.98s)]
*  Tax rates and mortgage rates have gone up. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=441.42s)]
*  But wages have remained flat. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  That's the honest economic speech he should deliver. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=445.62s)]
*  So no, a bunch of Hollywood celebrities are not going to be able to save him from the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=447.86s)]
*  actual plight of Americans across this country who understand and demand the truth. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=450.82s)]
*  And that's what Donald Trump and our party is going to give him. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=456.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's something that'll never happen. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=458.66s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=462.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=463.14s)]
*  Pavek Ramaswamy, thank you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1L6Vtz0fzw&t=464.14s)]
