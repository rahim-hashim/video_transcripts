# Trump has an optimistic and unifying message: Karoline Leavitt
**Fox News:** [July 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ)
*  Here now, with reaction—I'm sure they have opinions—Trump 2024 National Press [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary Caroline Levitt, Outkick founder Klay Travis and Fox News contributor Miranda [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=5.08s)]
*  Devine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=11.24s)]
*  Welcome aboard, everyone. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=12.24s)]
*  You know, just 13 days, really, since the assassination attempt, we had the RNC, we've [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=13.24s)]
*  had this switch-out with Joe Biden. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=18.8s)]
*  Every day, it's like a roller coaster. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=21.04s)]
*  There's Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=23.2s)]
*  He's speaking, you know, at a fundraiser and being his old self. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=24.2s)]
*  He sounds great. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=28.0s)]
*  It's an astounding series of events that I don't think is going to stop, really. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=29.04s)]
*  And Caroline, you're in the front of this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=34.16s)]
*  It's a remarkable period of time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=36.52s)]
*  With now facing this odd dynamic from the Democrats, how is the Trump campaign looking [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=39.24s)]
*  at this? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  And what is the president feeling about—if she becomes his opponent? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  Well, we are more optimistic and confident than ever, than President Trump—that President [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Trump is going to be victorious on November the 5th if Kamala Harris is the Democrat Party's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=57.52s)]
*  nominee. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  As you mentioned, Barack Obama endorsed her. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  The Democrats are making a big deal of that, but he also endorsed Hillary Clinton back [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=66.04s)]
*  in 2016. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  Ask her how that turned out for her. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=71.4s)]
*  Look, this election is going to be won by President Trump because Kamala Harris and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  the Democrat Party have put the American people through hell over the past four years. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=77.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris has supported 100 percent of the policies that Joe Biden has implemented [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=81.36s)]
*  that have created the worst inflation crisis in a generation, a wide-open border crisis, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=86.4s)]
*  war, chaos, and instability around this world. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=91.24s)]
*  And President Trump will continue for the next 102 days to share his optimistic, unifying [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=94.32s)]
*  message of strength, of bringing success and safety and security back to this country. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=100.16s)]
*  And we will force Kamala Harris to answer for not only her complacency in supporting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=105.4s)]
*  Joe Biden's terrible policies, but her own failed and dangerously liberal record as a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  senator from the very liberal state of California. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  She's weak, she's incompetent, she's the most unpopular vice president in history. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Caroline, it leads me into what I want to ask Clay, in that people are forgetting, I [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=121.64s)]
*  think, what a horrible candidate she was. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=126.76s)]
*  We remember Hillary being awful, but my goodness, the stories that came out when she dropped [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=129.88s)]
*  out in 2019 about the chaos in the campaign, the bullying, no vision, there was just a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=135.0s)]
*  lack of clarity, nobody knew what was going on. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=142.12s)]
*  Do you see that returning, or do you think Kamala has learned something? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=145.76s)]
*  Well, first of all, thanks for having me. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=149.8s)]
*  And the most important thing that may well have happened in the last couple of weeks [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=152.6s)]
*  is Caroline Levitt had a baby, and she's on here dominating with a newborn. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=155.96s)]
*  So that is absolutely incredible. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=161.28s)]
*  Congratulations, Caroline, on that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=163.44s)]
*  It is really amazing how you're already back up and throwing punches on behalf of the guy [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=166.16s)]
*  who needs to be the next president of the United States. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  Let me say this, Kamala Harris is an awful candidate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=172.44s)]
*  Democrats unbelievably had tons of time to look at her in the 2020 campaign, and she [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=175.84s)]
*  dropped out before votes started, and the only thing that she managed to accomplish [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=181.86s)]
*  on that campaign was calling the president that she ended up serving as vice president [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=186.32s)]
*  for a racist. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=191.16s)]
*  Democrats didn't like her. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=193.32s)]
*  She was a failure in her own campaign. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=194.68s)]
*  She hasn't gotten a single vote so far in 2024. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=197.66s)]
*  They've destroyed democracy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=201.7s)]
*  They've thrown the 14 million votes that Joe Biden got out the window, and now she is the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  nominee. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=208.94s)]
*  And here is what I think is ultimately going to happen. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=209.94s)]
*  She's got a little bit of a honeymoon. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=212.18s)]
*  She's a new face. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=213.8s)]
*  People are reacting. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=214.88s)]
*  There's a new storyline there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=215.88s)]
*  The problem is they've thrown everything they can, the entire kitchen sink at Donald Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=217.48s)]
*  There are no more insults. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=222.42s)]
*  There are no more attacks. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=223.92s)]
*  People don't know the truth about Kamala. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=225.68s)]
*  They don't know about how much of a failure she was at the border. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=227.54s)]
*  They don't understand necessarily how much of a disaster she has been on inflation, on [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=230.54s)]
*  crime, the fact that she supported defunding the police and raised money for everybody [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=235.42s)]
*  in Minnesota that was burning that city down, the fact that she still has a tweet up saying [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=241.1s)]
*  of all things that Jussie Smollett is a victim of a modern-day lynching. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=246.26s)]
*  She's a liar. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=251.08s)]
*  She's a bad candidate, and she's going to get exposed as all the truth begins to come out. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=252.14s)]
*  As I've mentioned to the audience, no one here has any opinions, so it's really good [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=256.22s)]
*  to figure that out. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=260.98s)]
*  Yeah, I have to say Miranda. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=261.98s)]
*  When we think about and remember Kamala Harris coming—she was, in the beginning, the anointed [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=265.3s)]
*  one in 19. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=271.58000000000004s)]
*  She came out, was like—everybody loved her, and yet now we've got the media. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=273.06s)]
*  It's embarrassing now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=278.38s)]
*  It is—it's almost like a panic, the way that we see these messages, the lies, that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=280.18s)]
*  she's the second coming. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=286.82s)]
*  Oh, my God, she's fresh. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=287.82s)]
*  She's the enemy of the status quo, really trying to remake this entire history, things [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=289.7s)]
*  going into the memory hole blatantly, that they just—is it a panic or is it hubris? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  Or do you think it will work? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=302.7s)]
*  Look, it's just more fakery because they're trying to elevate her as the candidate to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=305.78s)]
*  beat Donald Trump. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=311.26s)]
*  And the problem they have is that she is a shockingly bad candidate. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=312.82s)]
*  She is just intrinsically unlikable. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=316.5s)]
*  She's inauthentic. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=319.46s)]
*  She's insincere. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=321.26s)]
*  She's fake. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=322.26s)]
*  And women in particular pick that up and don't like it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=323.26s)]
*  They see her as someone, a woman who is a man's woman, not a woman's woman. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=326.82s)]
*  I don't know if men maybe are more fooled by it, but you just see that Barack Obama [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=332.18s)]
*  and Michelle Obama little video there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=337.22s)]
*  Obviously, they were not incredibly keen and eager to do it because I counted. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=341.06s)]
*  It was less than 20 seconds that they were actually speaking. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=346.74s)]
*  They spoke 55 words between them, a combined total—you could not have had a less enthusiastic, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=351.38s)]
*  smaller endorsement. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=359.94s)]
*  And you know, she tried to inflate it by having all these extra takes as if she was talking [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=362.17999999999995s)]
*  to them. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=367.02s)]
*  She's on the speakerphone pretending she's on the phone. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=368.02s)]
*  The whole thing is just emblematic of the fakery around Kamala Harris. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=370.58s)]
*  There is nothing about her that is warm, likable or real. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=375.97999999999996s)]
*  It's the opposite of what people want in their politicians. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  It is. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=382.5s)]
*  We really are at an inflection point. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=383.5s)]
*  This is the kind of panic that it shows in every single step, but it's up to the Republicans [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=385.38s)]
*  now to make sure that Americans get the right amount of information and the correct information. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=391.14s)]
*  Caroline, Clay, Miranda, thank you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  See you again soon. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMVgcZyV7wQ&t=398.9s)]
