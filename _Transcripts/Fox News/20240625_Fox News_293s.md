# Trump needs to pick a VP that he can get things done with: Charlie Hurt
**Fox News:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28)
*  All right, here with reaction Fox News contributors Charlie hurt former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee is with us [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, he's made up his mind apparently governor [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=6.72s)]
*  I don't really see a bad choice for the president [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  I guess at this point what it really comes down to is who is he most comfortable with I [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=12.18s)]
*  Think that's the big issue [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=17.56s)]
*  But you know [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=18.96s)]
*  Donald Trump needs to pick someone that will not be a distraction and there's two ways he could be a distraction [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=20.16s)]
*  Are she could be a distraction one if that person? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=25.48s)]
*  Tried to overshadow Trump, which is not possible. Nobody overshadows Donald Trump [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=29.720000000000002s)]
*  But if a person was so ambitious they wanted to go out and make a splash that would be disastrous [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=34.36s)]
*  Here's the other way all kidding aside [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=39.24s)]
*  Whoever he picks needs to be so clean so absolutely [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=42.64s)]
*  without any kind of controversy as much as is humanly possible that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=48.36s)]
*  The rest of the campaign isn't spent defending [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=54.24s)]
*  The pick of vice president he needs someone that is not going to allow [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=57.88s)]
*  The media to pounce and spend all their waking moments picking out something this person said something this person did [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=63.72s)]
*  Someone he or she dated in high school and is now coming back to bite them [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=71.28s)]
*  this needs to be a campaign that's focused on Donald Trump's record because that's what's at issue and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=76.08s)]
*  Anything else could be a real distraction and is not necessary [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=82.2s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't until the last possible minute at the convention, but I think he probably deep down knows [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=85.92s)]
*  I think it'll be a good pick but it needs to be one that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=91.88s)]
*  and we all understand they're going to go after this person as [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=95.88s)]
*  Viciously as they've gone after Donald Trump [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=100.36s)]
*  That's really well said governor and that goes to the first rule of picking a vice-parl [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=103.24s)]
*  And that's the only thing that's going to be a big concern for Donald Trump [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=107.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly and how great is that what the governor just said [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=113.2s)]
*  You know it is true. The worst thing you could do is anything that distracts from Donald Trump's record and his position on the issues [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=116.92s)]
*  That people care about man [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  If that's your concern right now in in a campaign [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=127.36s)]
*  Then you have a great campaign and you have a great candidate and I don't think that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=130.52s)]
*  I [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  Don't believe in this idea that if you pick the right person they're going to win this state or win that state [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=135.55999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't work in the best of cases and it's certainly not going to work in this case because [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=140.88s)]
*  People are going to vote for or against Donald Trump [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=145.6s)]
*  The only problem would be if you pick somebody that was a distraction from those issues and from his record [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=148.48s)]
*  and I think that that the two things that are most important one is that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=154.72s)]
*  He picks somebody that he is comfortable with and that he can govern with and then he can get things done with but also [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=159.84s)]
*  Someone that he can pick up the mantle and go forward with the America first Trump agenda [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  After four years and carry this through all you know [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=173.28s)]
*  we have there's a lot of work that needs to be done in Washington and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  I believe that this next four years will be the most consequential four years [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=182.68s)]
*  We've ever seen but it would be really great to get 12 years out of it [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=186.6s)]
*  It really would be amazing. I [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=191.36s)]
*  Think governor Huckabee and I maybe I'll ask both of you an exit question here [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=194.0s)]
*  If in fact Donald Trump picks somebody at the end of the day [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=199.24s)]
*  Isn't this really going to be a referendum on Donald Trump and Joe Biden really won't have that much to do with vice presidents? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=202.44s)]
*  Mike governor Huckabee, it's always that way. It's always that way [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=210.56s)]
*  We pretend that the vice president is going to make or break the election, but it never does [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=214.4s)]
*  It can be the distraction that I mentioned earlier [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  What this person needs to be is authentic if there's one quality that person has to bring its authenticity [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=221.08s)]
*  It's that he is a true genuine [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=227.8s)]
*  America first person by conviction not by convenience not because he got on the ticket [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  But because he or she is a person who is genuinely committed to the agenda [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=236.22000000000003s)]
*  That caused Donald Trump to be president in the first place and I believe will cause him to be president once again [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=242.32s)]
*  Real quick. Is it all about Trump Charlie? I [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=249.32s)]
*  Think absolutely and you know, I think the Biden campaign wants to make this election about Donald Trump and so do we let's make it about [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump the issues and his record [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=261.36s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Well said by the way for the record [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=265.36s)]
*  I think either one of you would have been great on the short list just saying [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=269.08s)]
*  Governor Huckabee the country could use your humor and Charlie they could use your humor as well [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you both. All right when we come back [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=279.08s)]
*  Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkOU55aY28&t=281.08s)]
