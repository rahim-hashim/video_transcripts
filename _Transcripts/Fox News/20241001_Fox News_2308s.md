# Fox News Primetime Recap - Sept. 30, 2024
**Fox News:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw)
*  Time for a real president. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=0.0s)]
*  Millions of Americans are suffering, and more than 130 are dead in the aftermath of one of the worst hurricanes ever to hit the United States. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=7.0s)]
*  And tragically for those affected, we neither had a president nor a vice president in place and equipped to direct the federal preparation, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=16.0s)]
*  nor to demand a swift response by the federal government. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=24.0s)]
*  The victims of Hurricane Helene didn't know where to turn over the weekend. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=28.0s)]
*  At this point you don't see a FEMA station set up. That's right. And we should. We should have by now. Yeah. Is that concerning? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=32.0s)]
*  Yeah. We expect more and we can't get out. You should expect more. Americans can't get out, they said, but Kamala Harris had no trouble getting in to California [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=39.0s)]
*  and to Las Vegas to campaign over the weekend. Well, the same with Biden. He spent most of his time at Rehoboth Beach. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=50.0s)]
*  You said you were going to put more resources in North Carolina knowing what you know now. And do you wish that you spent the weekend here in Washington rather than Delaware? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=58.0s)]
*  Come on, it's not that game. We're in Delaware. It's 90 miles up here, okay? And I was on the phone the whole time working on that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=66.0s)]
*  The whole time. Well, needless to say, they were both slammed for their failure to address the nation in real time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=75.0s)]
*  Asleep at the wheel, absentee leaders, the dereliction of duty. These were just some of the phrases ricocheting around Instagram and Twitter about what seemed like a low key public response to an epic national natural disaster. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=82.0s)]
*  Now, Biden finally got shamed into going. He says he'll go to the region on Wednesday. As for Kamala, her team released a statement saying she would visit the regions affected when it was not disruptive to ongoing operations. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=97.0s)]
*  Now, what they really meant was when it wasn't disruptive to Harris's previously scheduled campaign events. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=111.0s)]
*  We saw what a real leader's response is like this afternoon, though, and a very hard hit area of Georgia. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=117.0s)]
*  We have a lot of truckloads of different items from oil to water to all sorts of equipment that's going to help them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=124.0s)]
*  Many thousands are without power. They're running low on food and fuel. We brought a lot of it down with us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=132.0s)]
*  It's going to be distributed now or soon throughout Georgia, as well as North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Alabama and Tennessee. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=138.0s)]
*  And yet remember all the blather at the DNC about how Trump doesn't care about anyone but himself? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=147.0s)]
*  Throughout the region, our hearts are with you and we are going to be with you as long as you need it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=154.0s)]
*  It's called an hour of need. You're in our prayers and we pray to God. And throughout this long weeks, the long weeks that lay ahead, you're going to have a lot of work. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=161.0s)]
*  But the end result is it's going to be good. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=170.0s)]
*  Harris couldn't even give up a day on the trail to pretend to care. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=174.0s)]
*  Yet hours after Trump showed up with truckloads of supplies, speaking to first responders and volunteers, Kamala showed up at work. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=180.0s)]
*  I have received regular briefings on the impact of Hurricane Helene, including from Administrator Criswell. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=189.0s)]
*  And over the past 24 hours, I have spoken with Governor Kemp of Georgia, Governor Cooper of North Carolina and many local officials. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=195.0s)]
*  I have shared with them that we will do everything in our power to help communities respond and recover. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=203.0s)]
*  Hmm. Well, that's fine. And of course, the government should be mobilized to help. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=211.0s)]
*  But that does not change the fact that Biden and Kamala Harris were not at the White House driving our federal preparedness last week. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=215.0s)]
*  On the hurricane, Mr. President, why weren't you and Vice President Harris here in Washington commanding this this weekend? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=224.0s)]
*  I was commanding. I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday and the day before as well. I command to call the telephone and all my security people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=231.0s)]
*  OK, well, your job isn't simply to be briefed as you hunker down in Delaware or just proceed as if nothing's wrong on the campaign trail. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=241.0s)]
*  When you're president, you're actually the nation's chief executive and you're constitutionally bound to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=250.0s)]
*  Now, implicit in the oath of office is a pledge that your policies will prepare and protect us preemptively. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=260.0s)]
*  And that means we don't appoint people to key positions, key cabinet positions, because they're a first this or that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=268.0s)]
*  It means that you don't waste money that we need in times of crisis or fuel by draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help your party win the midterms. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=275.0s)]
*  What it means is that you're president in Washington and on camera, reassuring the public before, during and after a crisis. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=285.0s)]
*  That means you're leading with confidence. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=294.0s)]
*  Now, every college football coach in America, you all watch the games over the weekend. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=298.0s)]
*  Frankly, every senior associate at every major law firm works harder at their jobs than Biden and Harris. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=302.0s)]
*  It's not leadership to release a statement or release a photo while you're on your campaign plane. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=310.0s)]
*  It's not leadership to say that you spoke with officials on the ground or I'm getting regular briefings. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=316.0s)]
*  A chief executive drives the key personnel and knows enough to ask the right questions like how do we get more potable water in place before the hurricane hits? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=321.0s)]
*  And how do we distribute it as fast as possible? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=333.0s)]
*  The moment Kamala ended her prepared remarks at FEMA today, CNN went to a fire chief in Suanona County, North Carolina. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=336.0s)]
*  It's not too far away from Asheville. It's been flattened. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=345.0s)]
*  Kamala said we're with you at that FEMA briefing and you'll have everything you need. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=348.0s)]
*  Total destruction, devastation. And I don't even know if that would even be the right word to say. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=354.0s)]
*  This will never, this will not be a repair. This will be a rebuild. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=361.0s)]
*  Do people in your region have basic necessities like electricity or water? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=365.0s)]
*  No, the water and the power is both out currently in our area. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=373.0s)]
*  The businesses through our main part of our community that they're going to have to be tore down and rebuild. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=379.0s)]
*  The main bridge through our community is damaged. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=384.0s)]
*  That bridge goes over to a second day road. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=389.0s)]
*  That second day road is not there on the east side of the bridge. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=393.0s)]
*  It's not even there. It's been washed away. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=397.0s)]
*  Well, they've been on a water cell phone service and electricity for a couple of days now. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=400.0s)]
*  Now this is horrifying. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=406.0s)]
*  Every morning in a crisis like this, we need a real president who will call in all of the top officials to demand results expeditiously, not just get a briefing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=408.0s)]
*  All red tape must be cut. All of it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=419.0s)]
*  But literally no one thinks Joe Biden or Kamala Harris is doing everything they can beyond just observing what other people are doing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=422.0s)]
*  When Governor Ron DeSantis's team knew this hurricane was coming, man, did they kick into high gear preemptively. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=431.0s)]
*  They had their comms teams ready and in place. They had their logistics people ready. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=438.0s)]
*  Their search and rescue personnel mobilized. If you follow them on Twitter like I do, you saw it all. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=443.0s)]
*  But Kamala, well, she was busy with other things. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=449.0s)]
*  Good evening, Nevada. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=452.0s)]
*  Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=459.0s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=464.0s)]
*  And back to Mayor Pete, our Secretary of Transportation. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=466.0s)]
*  Well, he loves to go on TV campaigning for Kamala. Every five minutes seems like he's on TV. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=470.0s)]
*  But when will he go on TV to tell us when I-40 is going to open? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=476.0s)]
*  Or how many bridges are going to have to be totally rebuilt? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=479.0s)]
*  Will they drop all their DEI regulations, any that still exist, to ensure that people get the help they need as fast as possibly as possible? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=483.0s)]
*  But just like the slow and ebb response by the Secret Service at Butler Field, the delayed show of concern and coordination by our president and our vice president has bred its own conspiracy theories. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=492.0s)]
*  And what is the U.S. Postal Service going to do for all those counties that can't get their mail-in ballots? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=505.0s)]
*  Has Biden or Harris demanded a real plan for that? And what is that plan? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=511.0s)]
*  Now, if Trump had been president over the past 10 days, a lot of people in the federal government would have been working a lot of nights and on the weekend to prepare for this hurricane. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=517.0s)]
*  He was always pushing people to accomplish things faster. It kind of can annoy some people, rather go home early. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=527.0s)]
*  But if they screwed up royally or they didn't move fast enough, they were fired, sometimes publicly. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=532.0s)]
*  When somebody does a bad job, I fire them. They have done such a poor job and they never fire anybody. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=540.0s)]
*  You got to put pressure on employees to get the job done. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=548.0s)]
*  These people in the Carolinas and in Georgia, Tennessee, they're lucky that this is an election year. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=553.0s)]
*  They will get help. But the poor people of Maui still don't have all the help they need. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=561.0s)]
*  We don't just need a real president now. We need a real president next year and for the next four years. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=567.0s)]
*  The crises buffeting America at home and abroad are severe. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=574.0s)]
*  And if we do not respond in the right way and at the right time, the consequences for all of us will be dire. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=579.0s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=586.0s)]
*  Homes underwater and over 120 dead after Hurricane Helene ravaged North Carolina, Georgia and Florida. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=588.0s)]
*  So where's Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? The only leader to show up was Donald Trump. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=595.0s)]
*  As you know, our country is in the final weeks of a hard fought national election. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=600.0s)]
*  But in a time like this, when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need, none of that matters. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=607.0s)]
*  We're not talking about politics now. We have to all get together and get this solved. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=615.0s)]
*  We need a lot of help. They have to have a lot of help down here. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=619.0s)]
*  We look out for one another. We pull together. We pitch in. We persevere and we pull it through. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=622.0s)]
*  And that's why today I've come to Valdez with large semi trucks, many of them filled with relief aid and a tanker truck filled up with gasoline, which they can't get now. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=627.0s)]
*  And we'll be working to distribute it throughout the day. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=643.0s)]
*  I just spoke to Elon. I'm getting him. We want to get Starlink hooked up because they have no communication whatsoever. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=647.0s)]
*  And Elon, Elon will always come through. We know that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=654.0s)]
*  These are the things presidents and vice presidents do. So what's the White House doing? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=658.0s)]
*  Have you reached out to President Biden about federal relief efforts? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=664.0s)]
*  No, I haven't reached out to him. No, we can't. I think he's sleeping right now, actually. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=668.0s)]
*  Over a hundred Americans drowned and Biden spent the weekend at the beach. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=673.0s)]
*  Hurricane, Mr. President, why weren't you and Vice President Harris here in Washington commanding this this weekend? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=677.0s)]
*  I was commanding. I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday and the day before as well. I command. Call the telephone. It's all my security. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=685.0s)]
*  The media was dogging Joe all day about it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=695.0s)]
*  Do you wish that you had more resources in North Carolina knowing what you know now? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=699.0s)]
*  And do you wish that you spent the weekend here in Washington rather than Delaware? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=704.0s)]
*  Come on, it's not that game. We have, we're out in Delaware. It's 90 miles up here. OK? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=708.0s)]
*  I was on the phone the whole time working on that. And the resources. The question is not whether we get more. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=713.0s)]
*  This is a list of every resource for getting in there. But the question is how to get it in. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=720.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has accused both of you of ignoring the disaster. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=723.0s)]
*  He is lying. Let me get this straight. He's lying. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=729.0s)]
*  While Biden was at the beach during the deadliest hurricane of the year, Kamala Harris was hosting fundraisers in California. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=732.0s)]
*  Days later, she posted a staged photo from Air Force Two. The paper she's writing on is blank and her earphones aren't plugged in. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=740.0s)]
*  At least Bush looked out of the window, flying over Katrina. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=748.0s)]
*  Trump went to Georgia before Biden Harris. Trump went to East Palestine before Biden Harris. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=753.0s)]
*  Trump went to the border before Biden Harris. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=759.0s)]
*  Trump spoke to Lake and Riley's family before Biden Harris. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=762.0s)]
*  And he spoke to the Afghanistan Gold Star families before Biden Harris. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=766.0s)]
*  They say 80 percent of life is just showing up. And Biden and Harris have their own jets. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=770.0s)]
*  So what's their excuse? They can get anyone in the world on the phone in 30 seconds, but they won't even pick it up. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=775.0s)]
*  Trump goes to you. Biden and Harris hide from you. Trump shows you that he loves you. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=783.0s)]
*  Biden and Harris take you for granted. We all know people like that. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=791.0s)]
*  Over the weekend, Trump showed up at the biggest college football game of the season, Georgia, Alabama, and started slinging chicken nuggets. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=795.0s)]
*  USA! USA! USA! USA! [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=805.0s)]
*  When they put him on the Jumbotron, the stadium erupted. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=835.0s)]
*  Now I stupidly turned the game off in the second quarter because it was 21-0. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=865.0s)]
*  But Georgia came back in the second half and it came down to the last play. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=877.0s)]
*  Clay Travis was there with 45. Watch. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=881.0s)]
*  Today we had kids, Alabama, Georgia. We gave them a Kamala hat and a Trump hat like they do when they decide when they're recruits. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=884.0s)]
*  Everybody we asked was putting on the Trump hat. I think you're going to kill it with young kids, college kids in a way that you haven't before. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=892.0s)]
*  Do you feel that momentum? Well, we see it. We're up by like 30 points with the young people. So that's an honor. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=899.0s)]
*  Look, they see what happens. They're very smart. And look at the way she berated them. She said they're not smart. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=906.0s)]
*  They're much smarter than her, I'll be honest. But I think we're going to do really well. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=912.0s)]
*  There has never been energy like there is now. And I guess it's me. But you know what it is? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=915.0s)]
*  It's also when they look at what's happened to our country, our country is going bad. Our country is a very, very dangerous place, but we love our country. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=922.0s)]
*  And we're going to turn it around and we're going to make America better, greater than ever before. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=930.0s)]
*  With the football game and the hurricane, Trump's all over Georgia's radar while Kamala is in California with donors. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=935.0s)]
*  Trump hitting the full spectrum of voters. He's at UFC fights, Formula One races, golfing with Bryson, doing podcasts with Theo Vaughn, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=941.0s)]
*  enthusiastically courting the youth vote, promising the return of the American dream. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=952.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen young Americans go crazy for Kamala? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=957.0s)]
*  Today, she did her first podcast since Joe got whacked, All the Smoke, two former NBA players from Golden State. Listen. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=961.0s)]
*  I am blessed to have an incredible family and incredible friends. My best friend from kindergarten is still one of my best friends. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=969.0s)]
*  That's crazy. Right? Stacey Johnson. We used to go to the clubs and her father Seville. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=976.0s)]
*  Kamala's best friends in kindergarten, still one of her best friends. How's that crazy? What's so funny? Then Kamala was asked about the coup. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=986.0s)]
*  Look, from the time that the president called me and told me he wasn't running. I mean, it just like everything was in speedy, speedy motion. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=996.0s)]
*  And I was not sleeping so well. And that one morning I just, I mean, I had, I don't know, a few hours sleep and I, you know, I like to sleep. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1005.0s)]
*  I just got up, I was like, so I just went out and got a pork roast and started marinating. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1015.0s)]
*  See, time to work. Get to your happy place. And my family happened to be in town so they were very happy about the whole situation. But I just got up and started, everybody's asleep, I just got up and started cooking. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1019.0s)]
*  Barack and Nancy staged a coup and Kamala started marinating pork roast. That's not what she told CNN. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1029.0s)]
*  My family was staying with us and including my baby nieces. And we had just had pancakes and, you know, Auntie, can I have more bacon? Yes, I'll make you more bacon. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1036.0s)]
*  And then we were going to sit, we were sitting down to do a puzzle. And the phone rang and it was Joe Biden. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1053.0s)]
*  This was the biggest phone call of Kamala's life. And she can't remember if she was making pancakes or pork roast or whether her whole family was sleeping or eating bacon. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1061.0s)]
*  It's like everyone's asking Kamala what her alibi was when Joe got smoked. And she's got a different alibi each time. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1072.0s)]
*  You know, politicians can lie about a lot of things, but don't lie to me about food. Listen to Kamala when she was asked about her plan for the economy. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1079.0s)]
*  What is your kind of your economic plan moving forward for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and struggling for groceries and rent and homeowners? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1088.0s)]
*  So look, I grew up, so my sister and I were raised by our mother. We lived for a long time in an apartment on top of a childcare center. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1099.0s)]
*  That childcare center was actually owned by a woman who lived two doors down from us, Mrs. Shelton, who was by all of our accounts and feelings our second mother. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1110.0s)]
*  She helped raise us. And so she was a small business owner. I, from a child, knew who our small business owners are, right? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1123.0s)]
*  I mean, you're business leaders, but you're also civic leaders. You take seriously your voice and how you can mentor, how you can grow, right? Communities and the sense of communities. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1130.0s)]
*  I love our small businesses. So I've been responsible for billions of dollars more now going into our community banks because they're in the community and then they know who's in the community and where the talent is and who's doing good in the community, what the community wants. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1142.0s)]
*  Why does she say community so many times? Why? And she didn't even answer the question about making rent and groceries more affordable. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1157.0s)]
*  She sounds like an actress playing a politician who can't memorize her lines. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1166.0s)]
*  Can you even win the presidency with buzzwords? We're about to find out because every interview she flops. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1171.0s)]
*  The New York Times says Kamala is an effective debater, but when you throw her one on one in interviews, quote, she often winds her way slowly toward an answer, leaning on jargon and rehearse turns of phrase using language that is sometimes [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1178.0s)]
*  derided as word salad, but it might be better described as a meringue translation. It's all puff, but the left's now saying the president's policies aren't important. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1192.0s)]
*  We don't elect a president based on policies. We shouldn't. We should elect them for the character because we don't know what's going to come up. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1205.0s)]
*  The president's policies aren't important. You just vote for anybody with good character. All right, so Mr. Rogers should be president. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1214.0s)]
*  We don't know what he believes about inflation or immigration, but it's a wonderful day in the neighborhood. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1221.0s)]
*  Kamala covered up Biden's decline, ducked her job as borders are, lies about Trump all day and doesn't even show up to help hurricane victims. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1226.0s)]
*  Besides that, she's a nice lady. Ask all her staff who quit. They'll vouch for her. Americans want results. This isn't a beauty pageant. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1235.0s)]
*  The four years he was in office, we were doing good, absolutely good. You know, Kamala, she's already in office and ain't s*** done. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1246.0s)]
*  Trump's stealing the youth food. He's doubling his support with Hispanics and unions now want to make America great again. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1254.0s)]
*  Look at where Kamala Harris is today. She's only leading by nine points. That would be the worst Democratic performance in a generation. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1261.0s)]
*  A Michigan congresswoman, a Democrat who's running for Senate says Kamala is in big trouble there. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1270.0s)]
*  I'm not feeling my best right now about where we are on Kamala Harris in a place like Michigan right now. We have her underwater in our polling. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1277.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is the lead now in the Real Clear Politics electoral map and would win the election if it were held today. But Hillary's predicting an October surprise. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1285.0s)]
*  You liken yourself to Cassandra, the Greek mythological figure who could see the future and the prophecies but was never believed. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1296.0s)]
*  What is something you see happening in the near future that we should be taking more seriously? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1305.0s)]
*  I anticipate that, you know, something will happen in October as it always does. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1309.0s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight we are tracking multiple major stories both here at home and abroad at this hour. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1313.0s)]
*  We are monitoring southern Lebanon where Israel is now poised to expand operations against Hezbollah. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1320.0s)]
*  Now this after obliterating, I mean obliterating the terrorist organization's entire command structure including its 32-year terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1327.0s)]
*  Also tonight we're going to get reaction to Kamala's idiotic, insulting photo op trip to the southern border. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1338.0s)]
*  Now the mother of Rachel Moran, remember her? She was the mother of five. The mother of little 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungary. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1345.0s)]
*  They will join us tonight and according to local authorities their daughters were both brutally murdered by unvetted illegal aliens allowed into our country by your border czar Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1352.0s)]
*  But first our top story tonight complete and total devastation from Hurricane Helene across Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, entire towns literally wiped out by floodwaters [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1365.0s)]
*  as the death toll continues to rise with hundreds still missing tonight and with roads and bridges wiped out, thousands still stranded, many without power, internet, even the ability to communicate, many without clean tap water. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1380.0s)]
*  This is by every measure a national emergency and today Donald Trump he flew to Valdosta, Georgia to witness the devastation up front and personal and first hand and meet with disaster relief specialist from Franklin Graham himself and Samaritan's Purse. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1395.0s)]
*  Let's take a look. Many thousands are without power. They're running low on food and fuel. We brought a lot of it down with us. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1413.0s)]
*  It's going to be distributed now or soon throughout Georgia as well as North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Alabama and Tennessee. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1418.0s)]
*  Homes, hospitals, highways and cars have been plunged underwater. Entire neighborhoods have been turned into lakes. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1428.0s)]
*  Nobody's seen anything like it and to every family that's been displaced here in Georgia and North Carolina, which has really been hit. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1434.0s)]
*  We're going there also and they don't have communication. They don't have anything right now that they're we're trying to adjust spoke to Elon. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1443.0s)]
*  I'm getting him. I want to we want to get Starlink hooked up because they have no communication whatsoever. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1452.0s)]
*  And Elon, Elon will always come through. We know that. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1459.0s)]
*  Now, noticeably missing on the ground, the current president, Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1461.0s)]
*  Now, Kamala, well, she spent the weekend on the West Coast where she attended a very glitzy fundraiser in Los Angeles with her Hollywood friends. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1467.0s)]
*  What have I been saying? The Democratic Party today is now a party of coastal elites, Hollywood, New York, D.C. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1476.0s)]
*  Republicans are now the party of the hardworking men and women, the people that really make this country great. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1485.0s)]
*  And of course, Kamala did, however, she did find the time to post a stage picture on X, at least pretending to care about the people in the southeast. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1492.0s)]
*  Joe Biden, he spent all weekend at the beach in Delaware, you know, claiming to be on his phone. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1502.0s)]
*  But we know he was relaxing. They said in that Joe was on his phone a lot managing the disaster recovery from afar. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1507.0s)]
*  Well, that's, you know, hands on and compassionate. Take a look. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1515.0s)]
*  All right, time for a Hannity history lesson. Let's go back to 2005. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1536.0s)]
*  George W. Bush, you might recall he was vilified. He was demonized. He was called a racist. Why? For flying over the devastation. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1545.0s)]
*  He didn't want to get in the way of recovery efforts two days after Hurricane Katrina and looking down from Air Force One. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1553.0s)]
*  Two days now has been nearly five days since what happened last week. Two days after that hurricane made landfall. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1559.0s)]
*  You might recall the hysteria and the name calling and the blame that came his way. Take a look. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1567.0s)]
*  I believe that we can charge the government with criminal neglect of the people of New Orleans, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Louisiana in particular. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1574.0s)]
*  And if there were ever any evidence needed as to why we need a hands on president, all we have to do is think back to what happened along the Gulf Coast. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1593.0s)]
*  You know, that was a natural disaster that was turned into a national disgrace. The incompetence, the indifference, the insensitivity. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1601.0s)]
*  I think the administration got embarrassed with the response that Hurricane Katrina, they were embarrassed. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1613.0s)]
*  And unacceptable here sadly leads to people dying and people being harmed. Hopefully the president as we speak is in, somewhere in Mississippi I guess right now. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1619.0s)]
*  And the fact is that hopefully he will, as I've said many times, synchronize his conduct with his conscience. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1628.0s)]
*  We're now more than twice that time, four plus days after Helene touched down in Florida. And neither Biden nor Harris have bothered to even fly over the wreckage. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1638.0s)]
*  Biden literally couldn't even come back from the beach and his beach house and his beach chair early. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1650.0s)]
*  Harris, she was too busy living it up with her big money donors, you know, the George Clooney types, jackass that he is in Hollywood. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1656.0s)]
*  Well, where's the same outrage from the media mob? And then to make matters worse, we're now just a few hours away from a devastating strike from, you know, the East Coast and Gulf Coast dock workers, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1665.0s)]
*  longshoremen. This could literally cripple all logistics in the entire country and every single supply chain in America at a time when so many on the East Coast in particular are trying to rebuild and recover from the devastation of this hurricane. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1678.0s)]
*  Think about this. Last week, both Biden and Harris were so quick to step in front of a microphone and proudly announce $8 billion in new funding for Ukraine. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1696.0s)]
*  All told, military, humanitarian aid, they've already given $175 billion of your dollars to Ukraine. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1708.0s)]
*  Now, where are the billions and billions for North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, Florida and any other state that needs help? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1717.0s)]
*  Why are there no grand gestures for our fellow Americans in need? And as per usual, both Biden and Harris are now being shamed into action. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1727.0s)]
*  Biden will finally make a trip to the Southeast in coming days. Why? Because Donald Trump did it. But no trip for Harris is planned as of now. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1736.0s)]
*  And I'm sure we will embarrass her into it, although we haven't been able to embarrass her into doing a press conference. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1747.0s)]
*  So why does it always seem like the Biden-Harris administration is always behind the eight ball during every major crisis? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1753.0s)]
*  Why is it they have zero empathy for Americans who are suffering, especially Democrats that claim to have a monopoly of compassion? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1762.0s)]
*  And when real Americans are in need, where are they? $8 billion for Zelensky? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1769.0s)]
*  What about the people in North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Florida? How about helping them? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1775.0s)]
*  We see this now with the hurricane and also with inflation that they said was transitory for three-plus years. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1782.0s)]
*  And with the victims of illegal immigration, of course, the border is secure, the border is closed, the border is secure. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1790.0s)]
*  They lied about that for three years. They lied about and are proud of the botched withdrawal in Afghanistan. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1798.0s)]
*  But despite four years of nothing but feckless failed leadership, the race is still too close to call. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1804.0s)]
*  Over the weekend, we have a slight edge for Donald Trump in multiple polls. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1811.0s)]
*  Now, Atlas Intel rated the top along with insider advantage Trafalgar Rasmussen. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1815.0s)]
*  Well, it does show Donald Trump with the lead in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1823.0s)]
*  Rasmussen has Trump up in North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1829.0s)]
*  Trafalgar with a new poll has Donald Trump up with a two-point lead in Pennsylvania. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1833.0s)]
*  There are now more than six polls showing Donald Trump with a significant lead in Pennsylvania. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1838.0s)]
*  If Trump wins Pennsylvania, it will be very hard for Harris to get to 270 electoral votes that would be needed to win. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1842.0s)]
*  But North Carolina and Georgia, if you're in those states, it is critical for Donald Trump if he's going to win this election. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1851.0s)]
*  So let's be very clear. You now have 36 days until election day. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1859.0s)]
*  Early voting is now starting all over the country and anything can happen. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1863.0s)]
*  And this is an inflection point for the country. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1867.0s)]
*  This is a tipping point election and this race remains, for my comfort, too tight. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1870.0s)]
*  The latest polling out of Virginia shows that the state is, to the surprise of many, very much in play. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1876.0s)]
*  In all honesty, this success is getting kind of boring. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1882.0s)]
*  Happy Monday, everyone. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1885.0s)]
*  So this Friday, Joker 2 arrives in theaters and it's about a mentally ill man who terrorizes society with his mentally unstable female side. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1888.0s)]
*  But most of you have already seen it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1897.0s)]
*  Yeah, you saw that one coming up. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1901.0s)]
*  Half of the crowd's like, oh, here we go. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1905.0s)]
*  Earlier today, President Biden delivered remarks on the devastation caused by Hurricane Aline. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1908.0s)]
*  He comforted victims by reminding them of how he once survived a flood in an ark. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1913.0s)]
*  Reportedly, Tim Walz is nervous about tomorrow's tomorrow night's vice presidential debate. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1917.0s)]
*  He hasn't been this nervous since that time he ran out of tampons. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1923.0s)]
*  Ted Sackey told Doug Emhoff that he has, quote, reshaped the perception of masculinity. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1930.0s)]
*  That's true. Back in the old days, a guy like that might have talked the nanny into keeping the baby. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1936.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a good one. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1941.0s)]
*  Archaeologists in China have discovered a 3600 year old mummy that was buried with pieces of cheese. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1943.0s)]
*  One ticket to China, please, said this man. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1950.0s)]
*  He's afraid. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1955.0s)]
*  You'll laugh at that one, but not the very perceptive abortion joke. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1958.0s)]
*  He's afraid. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1962.0s)]
*  He's afraid. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1965.0s)]
*  He's afraid. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1968.0s)]
*  You'll laugh at that one, but not the very perceptive abortion joke. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1970.0s)]
*  Sean Diddy Combs is reportedly off suicide watch. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1973.0s)]
*  However, the prison guards are still on suicide watch to keep from killing themselves in case they hear him rapping. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1977.0s)]
*  New York City's fighting the rat population by feeding them pellets containing birth control. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1984.0s)]
*  Apparently, they kept wriggling out of their condoms. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1990.0s)]
*  While discussing the climate change hoax, John Kerry called the First Amendment a roadblock and expressed a desire to change it. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=1992.0s)]
*  Also described as a roadblock, John Kerry's enormous head. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2001.0s)]
*  And finally, scientists have figured out how to make the skin of live mice appear transparent. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2007.0s)]
*  Ugh, transparent mice? That'll just make it much harder to get rid of them. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2014.0s)]
*  When they get trapped! [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2018.0s)]
*  That doesn't make it better. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2021.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2024.0s)]
*  I don't care. You can't catch me. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2027.0s)]
*  So Friday, a massive story broke out about how our government allowed thousands of rapists and murderers into our country. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2030.0s)]
*  The source was not some right-wing think tank, a shut-in on the streets, or a police station. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2037.0s)]
*  It was ICE, our own immigration and customs enforcement. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2042.0s)]
*  Among the non-detained illegals, over 400,000 are convicted criminals, including tens of thousands convicted of sexual assault and homicide. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2047.0s)]
*  You'd think that a report from those in charge of the border telling us that tens of thousands of thugs have entered the country is a lie. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2056.0s)]
*  But it's not. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2064.0s)]
*  Instead, it was reported on X and on Fox. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2066.0s)]
*  The reason is simple. The legacy news decided this story had to be contained. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2070.0s)]
*  And so they pulled the plug like Andrew Cuomo at an interview with the New York Times. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2075.0s)]
*  The story was reported on Fox, and the news was reported on the Internet. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2080.0s)]
*  The story was reported on the Internet. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2085.0s)]
*  The story was reported on the Internet. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2088.0s)]
*  The reason is simple. The legacy news decided this story had to be contained. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2090.0s)]
*  And so they pulled the plug like Andrew Cuomo at an old folks' home. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2094.0s)]
*  Oh, tens of thousands of rapists and murderers, dead and violated Americans, and you weren't even told about it. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2098.0s)]
*  Remember that the next time you have the urge to trust the media? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2106.0s)]
*  Trust them as far as you can throw them. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2109.0s)]
*  And if you're trying to throw anyone from the view, have the number of a good chiropractor. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2112.0s)]
*  So how does a huge story break and it only shows up here and there? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2115.0s)]
*  It's like a sewer pipe after Taco Tuesday, maxed out, ready to burst. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2119.0s)]
*  But instead of calling a plumber, the media forms a seal against it to keep it contained. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2123.0s)]
*  That's how the news works these days. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2128.0s)]
*  With the exception of a few outlets, there's an ideological seal by our media against the natural flow of information to the American voter. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2131.0s)]
*  And it's to prevent anything but the approved election outcome. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2139.0s)]
*  Approved by them, of course, not you. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2142.0s)]
*  And when the pressure gets too much, that sewer pipe bursts and you're the one who has to deal with all the s***. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2144.0s)]
*  If America knew what happened at the border under Biden-Harris with tens of thousands of murderers and rapists freed into our country, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2150.0s)]
*  they'd never in their right minds vote for Harris or any Democrat, no matter how many staged photo ops she takes at a border she helped destroy. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2157.0s)]
*  Harris visiting our southern border is sort of like Sherman coming back to Atlanta, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2166.0s)]
*  or Alec Baldwin shooting a remake of Young Guns. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2169.0s)]
*  So of course the news must be suppressed. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2173.0s)]
*  They aren't even fact checking the stats because they don't have any. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2176.0s)]
*  And no one feels better hearing, hey, you know, it's actually only 10,000 violent invaders, followed by, oh, and please call them foreign exchange students. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2180.0s)]
*  Even worse, so-called sanctuary policies limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal authorities. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2189.0s)]
*  So ICE can't even arrest illegals convicted of crimes. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2194.0s)]
*  Some communities ignore requests from ICE to hold criminals longer so the agency can't take them into custody. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2198.0s)]
*  The result? More vicious, more violent crime in your neighborhood, around your family, your kids. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2205.0s)]
*  The news may shock you, but it's not your fault. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2211.0s)]
*  You just haven't been approved to know about what's really going on. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2213.0s)]
*  And sadly in America these days, what you don't know can hurt you a whole lot. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2217.0s)]
*  Now this is an issue where we should be able to achieve that political holy grail, bipartisan consensus, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2221.0s)]
*  because there's no question that most if not all Americans are against rape and murder, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2228.0s)]
*  and therefore against the influx of thousands of rapists and murderers into our country. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2232.0s)]
*  After all, who could be for that? Besides the makers of ski masks and bleach. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2236.0s)]
*  So we're left to ask, why is this happening? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2241.0s)]
*  Maybe they're doing crimes Americans don't want to do. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2244.0s)]
*  But why aren't they doing it? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2247.0s)]
*  Is it because they're protected from the violent consequences? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2248.0s)]
*  Or do they fear the political consequences? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2251.0s)]
*  It's both. Because aside from trying to gain this election, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2254.0s)]
*  you can bet there are very few migrant rapists running around in the New York Times newsroom or on George Clooney's Lake Como estate. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2258.0s)]
*  But you, like workers with a desk near Brian Stelter's bathroom, you're just collateral damage. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2265.0s)]
*  So at the same time, the progressive left hides the actual results of their disastrous policies from you. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2271.0s)]
*  They're making damn sure they're insulating themselves from those results. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2277.0s)]
*  It's just so much easier to be a progressive from DNC headquarters. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2282.0s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLF1Ks9SzTw&t=2301.0s)]
