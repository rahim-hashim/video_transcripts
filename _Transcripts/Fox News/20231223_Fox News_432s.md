# Tammy Bruce: Are Democrats failing Israel and Jews in America?
**Fox News:** [December 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU)
*  Welcome back to the special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=0.0s)]
*  Are Democrats failing Israel and Jews in America? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=4.28s)]
*  Well, today we receive the sad news that 73-year-old Gadi Huguay became the first American to die [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=7.88s)]
*  in Hamas captivity. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=15.16s)]
*  His wife is still being held as a hostage there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=17.32s)]
*  And earlier today, the U.N. Security Council voted to increase aid to Gaza, demanding a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=20.8s)]
*  humanitarian pause. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=27.0s)]
*  The U.S. abstained from voting. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=29.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, so-called pro-Palestine protests continue to arise across the country, including [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  this one in Detroit during a local Michigan Democrats' Christmas party. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  This brawl sent at least one attendee to the hospital, leaving others injured. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=43.4s)]
*  And get this, according to a new report, former President Obama has quietly lobbied in support [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=47.96s)]
*  President Claudine Gay following backlash over her controversial testimony on anti-Semitism. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=54.88s)]
*  So this is a lot to unpack here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=61.52s)]
*  Here with reaction, New York Post columnist and host of The Carol Markowitz Show, Carol [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  Markowitz, and Fox News contributor, DeRoy Murdoch. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=67.56s)]
*  Carol, let me ask you first, immediately out of this Israel situation, you know, we run [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=70.68s)]
*  the risk of becoming inured to news about Americans in peril, especially after Afghanistan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  There was outrage, understandably, over our 13 troops being murdered in that environment. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=84.04s)]
*  But in all of this discussion, we believe this is the first American to die in captivity. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=89.72s)]
*  But we had, like, 30 Americans killed in the Hamas attack itself. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=94.88s)]
*  How do you view this unfolding now, as more and more details come out and we have this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=100.8s)]
*  horrible news? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=104.8s)]
*  It's so pathetic. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=107.8s)]
*  The White House released a statement of condolences. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=109.16s)]
*  But where is the outrage that an American, Gad Haggai, has been killed? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=111.68s)]
*  Where is the American president to at least have some harsh words for the killers? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=115.68s)]
*  We're seen as weak on the world stage because of Joe Biden. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=119.68s)]
*  Americans being murdered abroad cannot go without mention. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=123.52s)]
*  A lot of people, you know, like to misunderstand when a Jewish American like me says that there [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=126.24s)]
*  needs to be a reaction. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=130.6s)]
*  I want to be clear. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=132.28s)]
*  I do not want American boots on the ground. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=133.28s)]
*  But how about some harsh language? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=135.28s)]
*  How about a hard look? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=136.64s)]
*  Anything. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=138.04s)]
*  Yeah, see, that's a great point. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=139.04s)]
*  I mean, you also, this transcends whether you're Jewish or not. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=140.72s)]
*  In fact, though, all of us should be fine to identify as Jewish because this is about [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=144.4s)]
*  a minority that people think will be abandoned, as it has been in the past. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=150.24s)]
*  And so this is what's fascinating. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=155.32s)]
*  DeRoy, we've got, you know, again, Americans, you know, over a dozen now, you know, 30. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=157.52s)]
*  Who knows how many really have been killed that we don't know and will be. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=165.16s)]
*  And yet it's like the White House shrugs. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=169.2s)]
*  We've got ships being attacked through the Iranian proxy group Houthi. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=171.52s)]
*  They put out a video earlier threatening America. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=177.6s)]
*  I mean, where does this go? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=180.76s)]
*  I mean, how much worse can this get? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=182.8s)]
*  It could get a lot worse, I'm afraid. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=184.96s)]
*  Look, people, first of all, let me express my condolences to the family of Gadi Hagan. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=188.4s)]
*  I'm sure this is very painful for them, and nobody involved in this deserves to have what's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=192.72s)]
*  happened take place. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=196.8s)]
*  But this could come here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is not just a problem for Israel, as you said, it's a problem for Americans. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=200.11999999999998s)]
*  30 were killed there, about 14 were held hostage. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  Some are still held hostage. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=206.64s)]
*  The Germans, Dutch, and I believe the Danes just a couple weeks ago broke up a Hamas plot [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=208.44s)]
*  to engage in terrorism in Europe. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=214.44s)]
*  There are people crossing the border from all over the place. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=216.64s)]
*  God forbid that Hamas decides, hey, let's go put some pressure on the Americans on American [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=219.64s)]
*  soil. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=223.64s)]
*  So this is not just an Israeli problem. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=224.64s)]
*  It has already become an American problem as of October 7th, and it could become one [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=226.24s)]
*  if, God forbid, Hamas decides to come and spread their terrorism into this country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=230.24s)]
*  Yeah, and considering the open border, years ago the State Department told us about how [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=234.12s)]
*  Hezbollah and Hamas were running some of the drug cartel rings from South and Central America [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=239.28s)]
*  up into this country, you know, for the money. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=245.68s)]
*  I mean, it's—so this is—people have got to be ready for horrible news, and we've [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=248.44s)]
*  got to be prepared for it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=254.56s)]
*  But I do want to move on to the nature of politics here now that are happening, Carol, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=256.04s)]
*  regarding Obama and Claudine Gay and Harvard. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, Obama is a very influential man, obviously. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=264.52s)]
*  She has been, I would argue, a failure. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=269.76s)]
*  As a feminist, it was wonderful to see three women heading universities speaking to Congress, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=273.36s)]
*  and then they all failed, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  They all kind of, you know, jumped in with the establishment. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  And for women who understand bias and unfairness and problems getting good jobs and being treated [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=287.32s)]
*  equally, you know, we should be on the side of everyone who has been, you know, attacked [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  or faces hate crimes or distinctive bias. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=302.76s)]
*  Why is Obama, you know, spending some of his cachet for her? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=306.56s)]
*  Well, Obama lobbying for her isn't a surprise. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=312.56s)]
*  I mean, Claudine Gay is on the team. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=316.32s)]
*  Woke politics is a team sport, and she's on it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=318.96s)]
*  I'm honestly glad that so many of my Jewish liberal friends have been realizing that their [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=321.6s)]
*  application for the team has been denied. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=325.88s)]
*  Please try again next year. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=328.08s)]
*  Look, she's going to be pushed out for her plagiarism, and that's fair. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=329.8s)]
*  I'd be fired for far less if I did even close to what she did. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=334.2s)]
*  But I hope she's remembered as the woman who argued that calling for Jewish genocide [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=337.76s)]
*  on campus had to be put in the proper context. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=341.76s)]
*  Her inhumanity towards Jews should be her legacy. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=344.76s)]
*  I know it's going to be the plagiarism that actually forces her out, but I want it to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=347.24s)]
*  be that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=350.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's a very good point, Dora. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=351.88s)]
*  I'm going to give you the last word here, because there's a—this is not just about [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=353.2s)]
*  that woman or the situation with Harvard. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=356.52s)]
*  This is a systemic problem, especially with the rise of anti-Semitism. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=359.32s)]
*  It really is. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=363.28s)]
*  I mean, look, if the question had been, does it violate the speech code or the regulations, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=366.0s)]
*  if you will, at Harvard for somebody to say, hey, let's have genocide against blacks and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=370.4s)]
*  wipe all the blacks out, she would have said, yes, that's awful. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=374.36s)]
*  We wouldn't permit that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=376.96s)]
*  But the question is, well, what about genocide against the Jews? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=377.96s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=380.36s)]
*  Put it in context. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=381.36s)]
*  Who really knows? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=382.36s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=383.36s)]
*  I mean, that should have been a very easy question for her and the other college presidents [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=384.36s)]
*  to answer. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=387.4s)]
*  The fact that they botched that goes to show how deep anti-Semitism has crept into the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=388.4s)]
*  left. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=392.88s)]
*  This is one of the reasons I think she ought to be booted as well, is 40 different examples [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=393.92s)]
*  of plagiarism. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=398.08s)]
*  Any Harvard freshman knows you don't do that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=399.08s)]
*  She did it 40 times. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=400.84s)]
*  She ought to be booted. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=401.84s)]
*  Yeah, talk about also a double standard with administration versus students and who gets [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=402.84s)]
*  booted and who doesn't. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=407.24s)]
*  But also the commitment—maybe it's Obama's commitment to DEI that this is a symbol of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=408.94s)]
*  the failure of that theory, and perhaps they just don't want the American people to see [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=413.88s)]
*  that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=418.48s)]
*  Carol DeRoy, thank you very much. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=419.48s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHEVSP1oFU&t=420.48s)]
