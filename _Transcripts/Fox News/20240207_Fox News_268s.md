# Eric Adams is giving ‘illegal aliens everything’: Curtis Sliwa
**Fox News:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c)
*  All right, as outrage grows over New York City Mayor Eric Adams handing out free, prepaid [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=0.0s)]
*  debit cards to illegal immigrants and the 180-some-odd million that he's now allocating [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=5.76s)]
*  towards, you know, more hotel rooms, the mayor decided to set the record straight today at [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=10.84s)]
*  a hearing in Albany and let the world know that's exactly what he's doing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=15.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  There's one thing I learned in New York. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  New Yorkers are very opinionated, and they share their thoughts. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=24.04s)]
*  And so first we want to dismiss the misinformation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=28.28s)]
*  We're not giving people American Express cards. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=33.04s)]
*  We found that the food delivery service that we set up during the emergency, we could find [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=35.78s)]
*  a better way to do it in our belief that we want to cut 20 percent of the migrant costs. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=42.42s)]
*  So we have a pilot project with 500 people that we are giving them a food card. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=48.32s)]
*  So instead of a debit card, instead of having to deliver food and have people eat food [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=54.72s)]
*  that we were seeing waste in food, they're now able to get their own food that is going [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=60.68s)]
*  to be spent $12 a day. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=66.6s)]
*  And 500 people get $53 million? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=70.64s)]
*  That's not all. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=73.28s)]
*  A couple of days ago, Adams decided that it was a good time to brag about his staff's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=74.28s)]
*  diversity. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=78.4s)]
*  He did it in his own way. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=79.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=81.08s)]
*  Stand up, stand up. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=82.08s)]
*  They need to see you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=83.08s)]
*  Deputy Mayor Williams-Eisen, Deputy Mayor Mira Josie, Deputy Mayor Armazan, Deputy Mayor [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=84.12s)]
*  Maria Torres-Springer. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Have you ever seen this much chocolate lead in the city of New York? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=92.72s)]
*  And then go down the line. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=96.56s)]
*  Look, look who's here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=100.2s)]
*  This is representative of the city. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=101.84s)]
*  That's why people are hating on me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=105.72s)]
*  Oh, that's why. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=108.72s)]
*  The Fannie Willis defense. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=110.8s)]
*  Anyway, joining us live. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=112.32s)]
*  He's on the streets of New York City. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=113.48s)]
*  Former mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa is with us. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=115.52s)]
*  So OK, he likes chocolate over vanilla. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  It sounds like, sounds a little like Louis Farrakhan to me there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  $53 million in debit cards for 500 people, on top of $180 million for more hotel rooms [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=127.52s)]
*  in New York, on top of the $1 billion that Biden has given people that enter our country [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=134.76s)]
*  illegally. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=140.28s)]
*  We saw what happened to the people on tape beating the hell out of two police officers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=142.04s)]
*  Curtis, things getting better in New York City? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=145.96s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=150.4s)]
*  In fact, that's why I'm his number one hater. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=151.8s)]
*  Join the Curtis Sliwa haters club of Eric Adams, who is single-handedly destroying this [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=156.48s)]
*  city by giving illegal aliens everything. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=161.76s)]
*  They arrive in our city. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=164.96s)]
*  Imagine, you check into your hotel, you get concierge service, and bam, you get a $30 [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=166.28s)]
*  thousand debit card that you can use for the whole month. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=171.92s)]
*  And you get more money than any veteran, any homeless person, any emotionally disturbed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=177.76s)]
*  person in New York City gets. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=182.72s)]
*  That's an absolute outrage. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=185.32s)]
*  And this mayor just doesn't seem to get it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  He takes care of the illegal aliens and forsakes his own people, especially the African-American [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=190.4s)]
*  poor and impoverished who elected him mayor of the city of New York over me, Curtis Sliwa. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=197.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=203.32s)]
*  Well, by the way, if you divide $53 million by $500, that's a $106 thousand debit card. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=204.32s)]
*  Not a bad deal. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't think they're giving them to vets that are homeless in New York City. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=214.16s)]
*  Not that I've heard, Curtis. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=218.0s)]
*  Well, in fact, our guys have just taken down one of the migrant guys right here on the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=220.04s)]
*  corner, 42nd and 7th while all this is taking... [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=226.04s)]
*  Can you pan the camera? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=228.44s)]
*  They've taken over. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=230.28s)]
*  They've taken over. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=231.92s)]
*  You light the camera over there if at all possible. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=232.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=236.92s)]
*  You got your key open, guys. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=239.92s)]
*  It's out of control. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  Out of control. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Out of control. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l8FWeBT5c&t=252.92s)]
