# Tim Scott responds to rift in Senate GOP caucus
**Fox News:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc)
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, I looked at the numbers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=0.0s)]
*  What percentage of the Democratic voters showed up for that primary in your home state? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Was 4% around the right number? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=9.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=12.4s)]
*  Dismal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=13.4s)]
*  Anyone who thinks Kamala Harris is way to the White House or through South Carolina is ridiculous. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=14.4s)]
*  Dismal performance in the Democrat primary last weekend. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=19.64s)]
*  But more importantly, Sean, think about this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=22.88s)]
*  She's weak on the border, weak on crime, weak on the economy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=25.16s)]
*  When I say weak on crime, this is the vice president who raised money for a bail fund [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=28.96s)]
*  for a person who was later charged with murder. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=34.68s)]
*  You remember those days, Sean. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=38.56s)]
*  This is a person who refuses to step a foot on our southern border. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=40.36s)]
*  Ten million illegal immigrants coming in. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  And in New York City, it keeps black and brown kids at home so they can use those schools [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=48.08s)]
*  the illegal immigrants coming into the country because Kamala Harris refuses to do her job. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=54.64s)]
*  Weak on the economy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  Poor kids today have less reasons to be hopeful because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took inflation [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=62.72s)]
*  so high that poor folks cannot afford food, energy or gas. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=70.48s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  By the way, that tweet to the bail fund, some might actually define that as insurrection. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=78.56s)]
*  I'm just saying as a side note. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  But of course, the media said most of those 574 riots that killed dozens of Americans, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=86.24s)]
*  injured thousands of cops, caused billions of property damage, they were mostly peaceful. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=91.72s)]
*  So we got to get that straight. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=96.52s)]
*  Let me ask you about comments. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=97.52s)]
*  Unbluable. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=98.52s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, by the way, do you stand with Ted Cruz and his comments about Mitch McConnell? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  Where do you stand on that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=105.16s)]
*  I wasn't in the room when those comments were made, but I can tell you this without [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=108.48s)]
*  any question. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=112.2s)]
*  What America needs to see is the United Republican Party telling the facts as they are. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=113.2s)]
*  The facts are very simple. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=118.8s)]
*  Sean, the president of the United States, Joe Biden, does not need legislative action [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  to secure our border. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=125.6s)]
*  Why do we know that to be a fact? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=127.24s)]
*  Because Donald Trump secured our border without the legislative action from the body. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=129.48s)]
*  He did so by creating policies like Remain in Mexico. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=135.9s)]
*  We precipitously saw the drop in illegal crossings. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=140.56s)]
*  What we know is a president with the guts, the will, the intestinal fortitude to secure [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=143.84s)]
*  our border can get it done. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  We've seen it done once. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=151.36s)]
*  We need four more years. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=152.68s)]
*  We were better off under Trump. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=154.12s)]
*  Well, that's now the big lie. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  Let me play comments President Trump made in his interview with Maria Bartiromo, and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  they had to deal with you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=164.8s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=165.8s)]
*  You know, I called Tim Scott this, because a lot of people like Tim Scott. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=166.8s)]
*  I called him and I said, you're a much better candidate for me than you are for yourself. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  When I watched him, he was fine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=174.76s)]
*  He was good, but he was very low key, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=176.72s)]
*  I watched him in the last week defending me and sticking up for me and fighting for me. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=179.2s)]
*  I said, man, I said, you're a much better person for me than you are for yourself, because [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=183.84s)]
*  for himself he was low key. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=189.68s)]
*  For me, he's been a real tiger. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=191.84s)]
*  He's been incredible. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=195.12s)]
*  Obviously, you're on Donald Trump's shortlist. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=197.44s)]
*  If he gets the nomination and it looks like he is, what would your answer be? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=200.24s)]
*  Well, my answer would be yes to America having four more years of Donald Trump. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=206.32s)]
*  I don't think any one of us should make this about me or any other person who might be [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=211.44s)]
*  the candidate for vice president. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=216.56s)]
*  But you and I know, Sean. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  He mentioned you by name. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  You and I know. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  You and I know. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  So that means you're on the shortlist. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  When it comes to you, what do you say? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=224.28s)]
*  Listen, everybody wants to serve their country. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=226.28s)]
*  And the best way for me to serve my country right now is to make sure that Donald Trump [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  gets four more years. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=234.84s)]
*  We're better off under Trump. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  You and I both know it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=237.88000000000002s)]
*  Let's vote for him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  But let's also get out and campaign for Donald Trump. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  We cannot afford people losing hope in the American dream because Joe Biden gets another [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=243.72000000000003s)]
*  four years. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump, low inflation, low crime. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=249.32s)]
*  We have law and order once again. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=252.64s)]
*  It's a good day for Americans. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=255.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=257.0s)]
*  I know you're in a circle and I'm going to talk to the two guys I know you'd call first [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=258.0s)]
*  that nobody knows who I'm talking about. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=262.28s)]
*  And I'm going to talk to them and make sure that they're prepared to tell you to say yes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=263.84s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=268.76s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us, Senator Tim Scott, and looking forward to the South Carolina [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=270.28s)]
*  primary. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCjTOBy0SMc&t=274.36s)]
