# Stephen A. Smith: The American people have spoken and Trump's your president now
**Fox News:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ)
*  He is the host of ESPN's first take. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He has a hit podcast. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=2.64s)]
*  All right, well, why the glum face? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=4.2s)]
*  Stephen A. Smith, you should not have a glum face. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=6.72s)]
*  You know, because you called me—because you called me to rub it in, man. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=9.4s)]
*  I mean, the inauguration is just a few days. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=12.88s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=14.36s)]
*  You're gloating. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=15.36s)]
*  I did not. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=16.36s)]
*  I'm listening to you talk about the Democrats. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=17.36s)]
*  I mean, what happened to moving forward? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=18.36s)]
*  You know, you're talking about the cognitive decline again. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=19.92s)]
*  You're choosing every opportunity to take a shot. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=23.12s)]
*  What happened to moving forward, Sean? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=25.92s)]
*  What happened to moving forward? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=26.92s)]
*  You're one. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=27.92s)]
*  You're one. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=29.32s)]
*  I don't take shots. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=30.32s)]
*  We have a rule. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=31.32s)]
*  You and I, when I'm talking on my radio show or on this show about sports, you never miss [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=32.32s)]
*  an opportunity to write me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=38.28s)]
*  You say, stay in your lane. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=39.92s)]
*  When you talk about politics, what do I write you? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=42.32s)]
*  Stay in your lane. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=45.92s)]
*  That's true. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=46.92s)]
*  Stay in my lane. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=47.92s)]
*  Stay in my lane, yeah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=48.92s)]
*  Look, what is it that I really want to understand? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=49.92s)]
*  I was talking about Joe's cognitive decline before the 2020 election. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=53.52s)]
*  I was excoriated for pointing it out. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=59.84s)]
*  The media beat the hell out of me for pointing it out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=62.88s)]
*  What is it, you know, about now that your eyes opened up? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=66.56s)]
*  I told you about their policies failing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  We showed everybody the border. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=76.04s)]
*  We talked about the economy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  We talked about war in Europe, war in the Middle East. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=79.84s)]
*  We talked about their weakness in regarding America's position in the world. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=82.82s)]
*  What part of my commentary did you miss? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, it was coming from you, so I'm inclined to ignore it half the time, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=91.05999999999999s)]
*  because you know how I hate agreeing with you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=98.82s)]
*  Number two, I think that one of the things that's inescapable is that you talk about [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=99.82s)]
*  things, you talk about inflation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  There was inflation under Trump. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  You talk about spending under Republicans. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  But in the end, here's what it comes down to. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  We looked at Biden as a problem. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=111.94s)]
*  You were supposed to be a transitional president. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=114.64s)]
*  You ended up trying to run. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=116.62s)]
*  You embarrassed yourself by going under the debate stage June 27. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=118.22s)]
*  What we found out post-election is how so many people on the left were a part of it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=121.74s)]
*  You know, when you think about and you hear about what Biden's position is and how he [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=128.22s)]
*  and his family don't necessarily vibe with Nancy Pelosi anymore, they feel betrayed, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=131.86s)]
*  feel about Obama, even though former President Barack Obama put out that very nice tweet [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=138.46s)]
*  about Joe Biden a couple of days ago. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=143.9s)]
*  We see Kamala Harris and some of the things that they're saying about her now, and they [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  weren't saying it before. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=151.46s)]
*  You're hearing how—and then you see the media, as you say, the media. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=153.06s)]
*  And what are people doing? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=157.86s)]
*  They're jumping down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss his ring. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=159.18s)]
*  They're trying to make sure that he's not going to be targeting them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=161.86s)]
*  All of a sudden, you don't hear racists now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=165.78s)]
*  You don't hear associations with Nazis and Hitler and all of this other stuff. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=168.02s)]
*  They're like, wait a minute here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=172.02s)]
*  You were sitting around convincing everybody and their grandmama that this dude was just [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=173.62s)]
*  completely unfit, the worst scourge of the earth that you could find, and now suddenly [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=179.7s)]
*  that you find yourself in this position, it's not like you're Michelle Obama— [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=184.34s)]
*  All right, but let me ask this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=187.62s)]
*  —who was it, you know, who likes not to be at the inauguration on Nancy Pelosi. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=188.62s)]
*  Instead, now you've got people kissing his you-know-what. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=191.94s)]
*  And I'm looking at that and I'm saying, y'all son knows. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=195.22s)]
*  Y'all son knows. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=197.22s)]
*  Y'all son knows. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=198.22s)]
*  They're kissing his ass. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=199.22s)]
*  You should never listen to y'all. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=200.22s)]
*  That's how I feel right now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=201.22s)]
*  And they're sucking on toes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=202.22s)]
*  I'll agree with you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=203.22s)]
*  It's pretty disgusting, people that didn't support him and probably will turn on him [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=204.22s)]
*  on a dime. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=207.74s)]
*  But here's what I—you watched last night, you watched the farewell address, and you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=208.74s)]
*  said it is sad. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=213.06s)]
*  And I inferred from that what you were saying, is you're sad because he is a sad figure. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=215.66s)]
*  He is a shadow of his former self. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=222.46s)]
*  And my question to you, you are very smart, you are intelligent, you are articulate, you're [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=225.7s)]
*  combative, I love you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=230.54s)]
*  However, why I played montage after montage after montage on this program for years, you [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=232.66s)]
*  have seen them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  How did you miss it? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  How did you possibly miss that? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=243.3s)]
*  Hold it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=245.22s)]
*  Hold it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=246.22s)]
*  Hold it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=247.22s)]
*  Hold it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=248.22s)]
*  Let me answer. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=249.22s)]
*  First of all, don't try that with me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=250.22s)]
*  I called Joe Biden out a year before the election. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=251.22s)]
*  I got raked through the coals right along with you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=253.98000000000002s)]
*  When you got raked through the coals, I was right there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=256.5s)]
*  Three years later. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=258.38s)]
*  Everybody was like, what are you talking about? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=259.38s)]
*  You don't know anything. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=260.38s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=261.38s)]
*  Well, it was like two years later. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=262.38s)]
*  But the bottom line is I was right there, the year before the election, OK? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=267.22s)]
*  Number two, when I talked about Kamala Harris and voting for her, what I said is I didn't [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=268.22s)]
*  want chaos replicating what we saw in his first term. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=272.18s)]
*  I figured you got the House, you could win the House, you could win the Senate, you'll [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=275.62s)]
*  have people that can literally position her and pull her to the center, and there won't [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=279.22s)]
*  be as much chaos because I didn't like the way that he acted. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=283.62s)]
*  And that's all I said. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=286.18s)]
*  I didn't have a problem with his position on the economy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=287.18s)]
*  I certainly didn't have a problem with his position on the border, OK? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=289.38s)]
*  I don't have a problem in terms of him and foreign affairs compared to some of the things [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=292.86s)]
*  that we have been seeing and how that was handled. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=297.02s)]
*  So there's a lot of things that we were agreeing with. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=299.44s)]
*  I just didn't believe that that man was the right man for the job, because I said the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=301.76s)]
*  presidency is a statesman's position. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=305.42s)]
*  I believed that somebody else would have been better. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=308.62s)]
*  In hindsight, looking at what has transpired post-election and seeing the level of the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=311.5s)]
*  groveling of one-minute or folks on Capitol Hill during these confirmation hearings, and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=318.98s)]
*  you're acting like you're campaigning. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=324.94s)]
*  He won the election, and look at how they're still acting. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=327.86s)]
*  It's all disgusting to watch. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=330.62s)]
*  It's all disgusting to watch. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=332.14s)]
*  OK, that's a fair point, and I think a lot of it is disingenuous. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=333.14s)]
*  I think it's insincere. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=336.62s)]
*  I think these are people that want to always be close to power. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  Could you imagine if Kamala won, and I asked for a meeting with Kamala—first of all, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=341.58s)]
*  she'd never grant it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=349.58s)]
*  To Trump's credit, he did grant it to people that he knows were not nice to him, not kind [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=350.8s)]
*  to him. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=354.7s)]
*  I think that speaks volumes about him. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=355.7s)]
*  Here's what I want to know, though, because you feel, with Kamala Harris, you believe [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=357.62s)]
*  that you were—you believe you were misinformed. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=363.58s)]
*  Now, we know her position on open borders. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=367.06s)]
*  We know she said we should never use the word radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=370.62s)]
*  She said we should never use the word illegal immigrant. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=374.85999999999996s)]
*  You know she wanted free food, housing, shelter, healthcare, education, sex change operations [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=377.96s)]
*  for illegal immigrants, and she's for wide open borders. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=384.44s)]
*  You know all these radical views. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=388.64s)]
*  I put together an entire file called the Kamala file, her in her own words. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=390.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=396.18s)]
*  Why were you misinformed? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=397.18s)]
*  You're one of the most informed people I know. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=400.18s)]
*  Well, listen, I'm—but I'm talking about on the left. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=404.18s)]
*  I know what your position is. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=409.02s)]
*  Who doesn't know your position? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=410.98s)]
*  You're one of the most relentless commentators in American history. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=412.42s)]
*  You were regurgitating the same thing over and over and over again. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=416.94s)]
*  Is that good or bad? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=420.18s)]
*  Is that good or bad? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=421.18s)]
*  It's good. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=422.18s)]
*  It's a compliment. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=423.18s)]
*  It's a compliment. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=424.18s)]
*  I've heard this all the time. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=425.18s)]
*  You're the most relentless commentator I've ever seen in American history. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=426.18s)]
*  The same message on point. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=429.58s)]
*  You never, ever stop hitting people with that message. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=431.26s)]
*  Okay, so I know your side. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  On this side, I'm saying, okay, let's bring the country together. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=436.72s)]
*  We've got some issues. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=439.78000000000003s)]
*  I certainly don't like open borders. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=441.02s)]
*  I don't like inflation. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  I don't like safety being an issue in the streets of the United States of America. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=444.1s)]
*  These are things we have to fix. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=448.34000000000003s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=450.04s)]
*  So if you've got an abundance of Republicans on Capitol Hill and you just happen to have [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=451.04s)]
*  a Democrat in the White House who ain't going to be chaotic, who ain't going to be a tweet [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=454.34s)]
*  in chief or something like that, then guess what? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=458.02s)]
*  I entertained it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=460.98s)]
*  But that's how I felt about it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=461.98s)]
*  In hindsight, I look at it and I say, listen, in the end, Trump is in office. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=463.9s)]
*  He won. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=468.46s)]
*  I'm not going to root against him. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=469.46s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=471.34s)]
*  And quite honestly, I'm interested in seeing if he's going to live up to what he said. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=472.34s)]
*  We're going to address inflation. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=476.8s)]
*  We're going to address our borders. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=478.14s)]
*  We're going to address safety in the streets of the United States of America. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=479.5s)]
*  He's going to start on day one. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=481.82s)]
*  He's going to return to, you know, have a promising future like he has sworn will happen. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=483.38s)]
*  I'm interested in seeing if he's going to live up to what he has built for himself. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=489.62s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=494.09999999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=496.34s)]
*  How come on this show I was right about the Russia collusion? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=497.34s)]
*  I was right about FISA abuse. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=501.62s)]
*  I was right about Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=503.94s)]
*  I was right about Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=507.7s)]
*  Earlier in my career, I was right about Richard Jewell. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=509.86s)]
*  We were right about Duke Lacrosse. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  We were right about UVA. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=514.38s)]
*  We were right about Ferguson, Missouri. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=515.66s)]
*  We were right about Freddie Gray in Baltimore. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=518.42s)]
*  We don't rush to judgment on this show. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=520.74s)]
*  We give people facts. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=522.9s)]
*  And we told the truth about Joe Biden. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=525.42s)]
*  We told the truth about Kamala Harris. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=527.6s)]
*  We made nothing up. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=529.8199999999999s)]
*  And all of the legacy media that for nine years has demonized this man, slandered this [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=531.6999999999999s)]
*  man, besmirched this man, allowed the DOJ to be weaponized in ways that had never been [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=537.98s)]
*  weaponized before. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=544.26s)]
*  How come they—do you believe their days are now numbered? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=546.06s)]
*  Because I think legacy media is now dead and they killed themselves, and they killed themselves [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=551.42s)]
*  because of a political agenda and dishonesty. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=557.02s)]
*  Am I right or am I wrong? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=559.62s)]
*  I think you're closer to being right than wrong. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=562.7s)]
*  And I think legacy media is in a world of trouble, based on your description of it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=564.66s)]
*  And I'm not about here to dole out sympathy cards. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=568.62s)]
*  There's no excuse for it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=572.38s)]
*  In the end, if you are in the media and you pride yourself on being a journalist, the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=573.62s)]
*  first objective is to know as much as you can. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=578.98s)]
*  Secondly, to be honest about what you know and you don't know. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=582.18s)]
*  And you can be subjective in what you would like to receive, but ultimately you have to [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=585.54s)]
*  be an objective grabber of the information and make sure you're disseminating that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=591.82s)]
*  to the masses. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=596.38s)]
*  And what we've seen is people take an agenda spin. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=597.38s)]
*  You make sure the world knows you're not a journalist, that you're out here, this [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=600.14s)]
*  is who you feel, you are a staunch conservative, these are what you believe, this is what you [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=603.38s)]
*  stand on, fair enough. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=607.78s)]
*  If somebody on the left does that, that's fine too. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=609.46s)]
*  Can I interrupt? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=611.66s)]
*  But we have to—okay, go ahead. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=612.66s)]
*  Can I interrupt on that? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=613.66s)]
*  Sure, please, go ahead. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=614.66s)]
*  Okay, I'm a member of the press, Stephen A. Like you're a member of the press, okay? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=615.66s)]
*  I can produce thousands of hours of straight news, thousands of hours of investigative [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=619.54s)]
*  reporting. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=624.02s)]
*  We reported on Kamala in her own words when the rest of the media, this election ignored [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=625.02s)]
*  it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=629.0999999999999s)]
*  That is on them. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=630.0999999999999s)]
*  They failed the American people. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=631.0999999999999s)]
*  I give opinion, but I'm open, I'm upfront, I'm a conservative, I voted for Donald Trump, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=632.0999999999999s)]
*  I didn't hide a thing. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=637.2199999999999s)]
*  And then we talk sports, which makes you crazy, and culture, woke, we talk about all of it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=638.5799999999999s)]
*  So, I'm like an entire newspaper. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=646.02s)]
*  They claim they're journalists. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=647.54s)]
*  They're not—the people of fake news, CNN, those conspiracy theory-peddling idiots on [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=650.1s)]
*  MSDNC, they're not journalists. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=657.18s)]
*  They are left-wing radical talk shows. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=660.38s)]
*  You are far more honest on your worst day than they could ever dream to be. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=662.9s)]
*  Okay, but let's take into account—I'm not going to get into your competition, because [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=668.42s)]
*  you're always talking about MSNBC and CNN. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=673.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to go there. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=675.9399999999999s)]
*  What I will say to you— [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=676.9399999999999s)]
*  And on my competition— [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=677.9399999999999s)]
*  In no way—yeah, you're right about that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=678.9399999999999s)]
*  But in no way defending anybody. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=682.42s)]
*  What I would say to you is this. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=684.18s)]
*  The industry turned, if we're being quite honest with it, when it became profitable [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=685.78s)]
*  to turn that way. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=690.0s)]
*  The reality is that I came up in an industry—you're writing for the newspaper industry, you're [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=691.38s)]
*  lucky to make $75,000 to $90,000 a year at one time. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=694.3399999999999s)]
*  You radio a few hundred thousand dollars. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=697.02s)]
*  Now you're in a position where it's millions and millions upon millions of dollars out [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=699.38s)]
*  there to be had. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=703.3s)]
*  And there's a lot of people in the media and outside of the media that have fallen [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=704.3s)]
*  for that hook, line of sinker. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=709.54s)]
*  And to be a pundit, to be a partisan pundit, they deem far more profitable. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=711.34s)]
*  You bring up the George Soros of the world and others, right, and how, you know, they [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=716.5s)]
*  funnel money for certain causes or what have you. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=720.54s)]
*  Well, who the hell you think is getting some of that money? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=722.98s)]
*  I mean, people are getting paid to disseminate opinions and things of that nature. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=725.02s)]
*  That's not to say they're faking about what they feel, because if they have an objective [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=728.18s)]
*  against somebody else, they're certainly going to exercise that to the best of their [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=732.5s)]
*  ability. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=738.38s)]
*  But in the end, what you're pointing out is that it has done America a disservice. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=739.38s)]
*  Because let me tell you something right now. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=743.82s)]
*  This is what I said, and I'm going to bring up the confirmation hearings again when I [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=745.46s)]
*  say this. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=748.1s)]
*  Donald Trump, there's no way in hell that I think that the man is innocent of every [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=749.1s)]
*  single little thing, nor do I think he's guilty of every single thing they said. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=755.5s)]
*  What I will say is this. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=760.46s)]
*  The man won the election. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=762.0600000000001s)]
*  The American people have spoken. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=763.3000000000001s)]
*  What the hell are you doing on Capitol Hill acting like you're still on a campaign trail, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=765.0600000000001s)]
*  talking about him like they are votes at stake? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=770.34s)]
*  He's your president now. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=772.86s)]
*  You have to sit up there and say, I hope he does well for this country. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=774.82s)]
*  I hope he does the kind of things he says he's going to do to make our country better [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=778.22s)]
*  again. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=782.22s)]
*  I hope those things happen. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=783.22s)]
*  You can't be rooting against him because you don't like him at the expense of the United [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=784.38s)]
*  States of America. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=789.78s)]
*  We have gotten to that point in our society where you have too many people that are doing [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=791.54s)]
*  that, and that's the real problem in America. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=795.58s)]
*  That's what you're really talking about. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=797.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=798.78s)]
*  I am going to make it my mission to somehow one day, hopefully, bring you and Donald Trump [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=799.78s)]
*  together. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=806.02s)]
*  Not you making the move. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=807.0600000000001s)]
*  I will be the peacemaker. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=810.34s)]
*  The Bible says, blessed are the peacemakers. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=811.58s)]
*  I want to be one. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=813.84s)]
*  I'll say one last thing about the media. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=814.84s)]
*  The people that survive in media will be people that tell truth, and you're one of them. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=817.26s)]
*  You'll always do well, and that's why you're my dear friend. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=825.78s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFsHOuz-CQ&t=828.86s)]
