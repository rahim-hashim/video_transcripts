# Sean Hannity: This is troubling
**Fox News:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M)
*  We turn our attention to another interview on another network. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=0.0s)]
*  I didn't think there were other networks. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=4.0s)]
*  Anyway, Kamala Harris sat down for her first and only solo national interview. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=5.44s)]
*  How brave of the campaign, with, of course, one of her top supporters at MSDNC, Stephanie Rule. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=10.08s)]
*  Now, she's a big supporter of Kamala Harris. She is rooting for Kamala to win. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=16.56s)]
*  That's fine in my book. She's a radical left-wing talk show host. Needless to say, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=21.04s)]
*  this was not a hard-hitting interview with a nonpartisan reporter. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=27.2s)]
*  By the way, that's okay. I interviewed Donald Trump. I definitely want Donald Trump to win. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=30.64s)]
*  I'm not shy about it. I say it all the time. We have members of both members of the press. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=35.04s)]
*  She fancies herself a journalist. She's not. She's a talk show host like me. I'm honest about who I am. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=39.76s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't just talk to yours truly. He answers questions. He does press avails on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=46.16s)]
*  virtually every outlet on a regular basis. So does JD Vance. Even he does it with networks [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=52.0s)]
*  that hate him, which is most of the media mob. So for tonight's appearance on MSDNC to be Kamala's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=57.84s)]
*  only solo national television interview, you know, after the 16 minutes and 29 seconds [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=64.72s)]
*  with Tim Walz on fake news CNN, it's troubling, especially when she can't even answer a single [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=71.76s)]
*  question without contradicting herself. For example, here she is vowing to fix the economy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=78.24s)]
*  Last year she was saying, we call it Bidenomics and we're so proud of it. Take a look. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=84.32s)]
*  We have aspirations. We have dreams. We can see what's possible. We have an incredible work ethic, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=90.56s)]
*  but not everyone has the access to the opportunities that allow them to achieve those [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  things. But we don't lack for those things, but not everyone, you know, gets handed stuff on a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=105.04s)]
*  silver platter. All that ladies and gentlemen and everyone else that is called Bidenomics. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics and we are very proud of Bidenomics. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  Oh, the giggling vice president, proud of Bidenomics until finally now the realities [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=125.68s)]
*  set in that, oh, I'm not so proud. Also, she talked about fixing the border, but during the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=130.64s)]
*  very height of the border crisis, your borders are kept telling you the border is secure when it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=136.23999999999998s)]
*  never was and everybody knew it. Take a look. Well, first of all, we do have a broken immigration [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=141.76s)]
*  system and it needs to be fixed. The border is secure. You're confident this border is secure? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=149.2s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and our administration. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=154.08s)]
*  Never mind. She wants free housing, healthcare, food, education, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  amnesty and, oh, sex change operations for illegal immigrants to reward them for their [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=170.56s)]
*  illegal behavior. Is Kamala ever going to explain blatant lies? Is she ever going to be asked by the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=175.12s)]
*  media, I doubt it. And look at your screen. Will she ever be asked about her radical stated positions [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=180.64s)]
*  in her own words? Because tonight there was no mention of her support for getting rid of the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=186.48s)]
*  filibuster to pass the $93 trillion Green New Deal or government healthcare for all and banning [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  private health insurance or banning fracking and offshore drilling or decriminalizing illegal [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  immigration and offering all these free, free everything for illegals. And on top of that, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=203.04s)]
*  then we have Kamala Harris, even those, you know, that are in jail would get sex change operations. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=209.04s)]
*  It is bizarre. And even during tonight's softball questions, Kamala struggled again. This was [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=214.56s)]
*  supposed to be an easy interview with a friendly MSDNC liberal leftist talk show host that was [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=220.32s)]
*  going to bat for her over the weekend. Take a look. I don't think it's a lot to ask her to sit down [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  for a real interview as opposed to a puff piece in which she describes like her, her feelings of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=233.68s)]
*  growing up in Oakland with nice laws. Then I would just say to that when you move to Nirvana, give me [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  your real estate broker's number and I'll be your next door neighbor. We don't live there. I'm not, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=245.68s)]
*  I just said I'm not going to vote for her. Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. She's running [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=250.8s)]
*  against Trump. We have two choices. And so there are some things you might not know her answer to. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=254.72s)]
*  And in 2024, unlike 2016 for a lot of the American people, we know exactly what Trump will do, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=261.76s)]
*  who he is and the kind of threat he is to democracy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=269.12s)]
*  It's not Nirvana to expect somebody who wants to be president to answer questions about what she [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=273.76s)]
*  says she wants to do. Now she had, she had a hard time answering questions from a loyal supporter [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=279.76s)]
*  at, you know, socialist MSDNC who wants to give her a free pass on everything. How is she going [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=285.68s)]
*  to confront Putin or Chi or the mulls in Iran as president? And by the way, we reported last night, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  the Islamic Republic of Iran, they are now actively trying to murder Donald Trump. This should come as [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=297.12s)]
*  no surprise. In 2022, they released a cheap, poorly produced, animated video fantasizing about [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=303.92s)]
*  assassinating Donald Trump on a golf course near Mar-a-Lago as a revenge for killing their [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=309.92s)]
*  favorite terrorists. And that would be General Soleimani. And now coordinated efforts from Iran [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  to assassinate Donald Trump are intensifying as the electioneers. My sources say it is beyond the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=320.24s)]
*  pale. It's never been this loud. It's never been this dangerous. But at the same time, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=327.12s)]
*  the Iranian president is in our country, allowed in this country to spew anti-American rhetoric, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=332.48s)]
*  anti-Semitic rhetoric at the United Nations. Here's how Donald Trump responded. By the way, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=338.64s)]
*  We are under threat. I have been threatened very directly and I appreciate the agencies that we've [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=344.32s)]
*  been meeting with, but we've been threatened very directly by Iran. And I think you have to let them [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=350.96s)]
*  know because the best way to do it is through the office of the president that you do any attacks on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  former presidents or candidates for president. Your country gets blown to smithereens, as we say. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=362.08s)]
*  The Iranians fear Trump. They're not going to hear a response like that from Kamala Harris or [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=371.12s)]
*  Joe Biden. They are unable to muster the courage to openly defend Donald Trump and his supporters [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=375.28s)]
*  from threats from a foreign nation, a radical Islamic terrorist supporting nation, the number [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=381.36s)]
*  one state sponsor of terrorism. They continuously spout their own toxic rhetoric against Donald [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=386.96s)]
*  Trump. Iran now trying to interfere in this election, murdered Donald Trump. They already [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=392.56s)]
*  hacked his campaign emails. Nobody in the press seems to give a damn. And the left's dangerous [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  rhetoric just continues. And this includes Biden's idiotic commerce secretary, Gina [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  Raimondo, who just called on MSDNC for Donald Trump to be extinguished for good. Take a look. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=409.84s)]
*  What he says is the opposite. It's just another lie. Like, how did we get here? Let's extinguish [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=418.4s)]
*  him for good. We have an answer. We have a remarkably talented candidate who is sincere, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=424.64s)]
*  who's pragmatic, who's open. Let's just get it done. And extinguish, you mean vote him out? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=430.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. Vote him out. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=435.68s)]
*  Donald Trump has just survived not one, but two assassination attempts, all while Iran is trying [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  to finish the job. And they still didn't sweep the area around Trump International. And a member [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=444.8s)]
*  of Biden's cabinet is calling for Trump to be extinguished for good, frankly, beyond irresponsible. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=450.0s)]
*  And by the way, Secret Service, maybe bring her in and ask her what the hell she meant by that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=455.68s)]
*  And it's not just Raimondo. On that hard-hitting news show, the view Joe Biden himself continued [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=461.28s)]
*  to dehumanize Donald Trump, even pretended to squish him like a bug. Lied to two assassination [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  attempts, maybe not the smartest move. Take a look. He's blaming rhetoric from you, that you [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  inspired these two assassination attempts. After all of the calls for violence, you know, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=480.0s)]
*  take them out and all the rest of it. You know what it is. Don't you think that that is just [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=487.76s)]
*  unbelievable? And what do you say to that? Well, I think he is the most unusual president. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=492.24s)]
*  Look, when I ran, I said I was running. One of the first major speeches I made was [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=500.96s)]
*  for Independence Hall about democracy, that democracy was at stake. Look, Trump is... [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=507.2s)]
*  He's... [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=512.64s)]
*  Careful. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=516.48s)]
*  There's not a lot of social redeeming value there. He just wouldn't go... He was like a bug. He just [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=519.68s)]
*  kept being there. He was like a bug right there. So you felt... [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=526.0s)]
*  According to the Democrats, the mob, the media, state-run media, Trump is an existential threat [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=534.8s)]
*  to our survival. They say it all the time. They compare him to Hitler. They vilify him around [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=539.2s)]
*  every turn. Some even, you know, after Trump was almost murdered. Take a look. He's a genuine [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=544.0s)]
*  danger to American security. You know, Donald Trump presents a challenge and a threat fundamentally [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  to the republic. Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy and our most fundamental [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  freedoms. Don't give them the power. Look, are they a threat to democracy? Yes. Are they going [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=563.44s)]
*  to take our rights away? Yes. Donald Trump presents an existential threat to democracy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=567.44s)]
*  He has advertised he is going to transition this country from a democracy to a dictatorship. He is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=572.48s)]
*  paving the way to become a Vladimir Putin or to become an Adolf Hitler or a Kim Jong-un. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  That's what he wants to be. We have to defeat a person who is a threat to our democracy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=584.72s)]
*  Reckless, irresponsible and consistent. That's it. This is the new radical, extreme, Marxist, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  leftist party that wants to get in power. This isn't new. The left in this country has openly [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=598.56s)]
*  been fantasizing about Donald Trump's demise for years, and nobody's been held accountable. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=603.8399999999999s)]
*  Take a look. That man cannot see public office again. He is not only unfit, he is destructive [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=609.12s)]
*  to our democracy, and he has to be eliminated. The donor class can't just sit back on the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=619.0400000000001s)]
*  sidelines and say, oh, well, don't worry, this will all work itself out. They're still going to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=625.84s)]
*  have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump, and that's a fact. Yes. I have thought an awful [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=630.24s)]
*  lot about blowing up the White House. When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=636.32s)]
*  I want to clarify, I'm not an actor. I lie for a living. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=643.04s)]
*  However, it's been a while. And maybe it's time. How dare he say the things he does? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=650.64s)]
*  Of course I want to punch him in the face. Right, area. Yes. Press always asks me, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=658.48s)]
*  don't I wish I were debating him? No, I wish you were in high school. I could take it behind the gym. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=663.12s)]
*  That's what I wish. And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=668.8s)]
*  Eliminated, put a bullet in Trump, blow up the White House. When's the last time an actor [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=677.12s)]
*  murdered a president? I will take him out tonight. If you're a Trump hater or a Democrat, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=682.32s)]
*  the media mob, you'll get a pass. You know, your violent rhetoric, you know, you can joke about [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=687.84s)]
*  killing a president. You can even glorify violent crime and rioting. In fact, the current Democratic [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=693.12s)]
*  nominee for president, Kamala Harris, she has done both. Take a look. If you had to be stuck in an [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=698.48s)]
*  elevator with either President Trump, Mike Pence or Jeff Sessions, who would it be? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=704.24s)]
*  Does one of us have to come out alive? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=710.4s)]
*  They're not going to stop before election day in November and they're not going to stop after [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=714.24s)]
*  election day. And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=718.08s)]
*  that this isn't, they're not going to let up and they should not. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=722.64s)]
*  Trump is a threat to our democracy and he only fights for himself, not you. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=726.08s)]
*  They said, well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened? I said, well, look, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=733.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, obviously he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=738.32s)]
*  The rioters won't stop. They shouldn't stop or we're not going to stop supporting them. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=743.2s)]
*  And by the way, a lot of this said after the assassination attempt to now against Donald Trump, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=750.1600000000001s)]
*  but if the roles were reversed, can you imagine the hysteria of state-run media mob [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=754.88s)]
*  being on a whole new level? Keep in mind the would-be assassin on Trump's golf course in [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=759.76s)]
*  West Palm Beach, Florida, mere 300 yards away from the former president who was heading in [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=765.36s)]
*  his direction, hiding in an area never swept by the Secret Service, even though they knew about [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=770.4s)]
*  this Iranian threat, even though unauthorized paparazzi were known to post up there. Meanwhile, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=775.76s)]
*  the shooter and Butler PA, less than 150 yards away from the president on a rooftop in plain sight [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  when he fired several rounds. And tonight, preliminary Senate report out on the assassination [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=787.36s)]
*  attempts in Butler, Pennsylvania, startling failures of the Secret Service, the only drone [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=792.8s)]
*  visuals controlled by an agent who had just one hour of informal training on the device, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=798.16s)]
*  had to call a toll-free number for technical help with the drone he's operating. More alarming, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=803.76s)]
*  the lead Secret Service agent at the rally was aware of credible intelligence about a threat [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=809.8399999999999s)]
*  against Trump, but never passed it along to his fellow agents. Meanwhile, the on-site communications, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=815.8399999999999s)]
*  a complete disaster. Secret Service agents observed local law enforcement running to the building, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=821.68s)]
*  guns drawn, where the shooter was stationed, but didn't know what was happening. I mean, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=827.68s)]
*  what's going on here? And this doesn't take away from the heroism of the agents in Butler [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=832.9599999999999s)]
*  or the agents in West Palm Beach around President Trump. There have been numerous disasters [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=837.76s)]
*  during the Biden-Harris administration for nearly four years, one crisis after another, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=843.5999999999999s)]
*  self-imposed. If you're looking for someone to blame, start at the top, work your way down. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=848.88s)]
*  Take a look. As vice president, there wasn't a single thing that I did that she couldn't do. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=855.12s)]
*  And so I was able to delegate her responsibility on everything from foreign policy to domestic policy. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=861.76s)]
*  After the last four years, that is probably the single worst thing Biden could have said about [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=869.12s)]
*  Harris. She might be an even less competent, more extreme version of Joe. In fact, the New York [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=873.68s)]
*  Post just uncovered Kamala's past support for handgun confiscation. And by the way, she'd blow [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=879.2s)]
*  somebody away in her house and she's packing. Just add it to the list that's growing about [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=884.8s)]
*  Kamala's radical positions that make her the most extreme, radical candidate to ever run for that [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T2_wPbec1M&t=890.4799999999999s)]
