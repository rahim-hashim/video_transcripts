# Sean Hannity unpacks why Democrats are in a state of 'utter panic'
**Fox News:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight we are going to stop our election countdown [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  because really every day is Election Day. Right now is Election Day in most [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  states, commonwealths in our country and it's all across the country, meaning you [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=10.52s)]
*  can vote today, tomorrow, the next day and you don't need to wait 14 days until [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=15.4s)]
*  officially Election Day, November the 5th. Now in fact it is a good idea, my view, to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=21.6s)]
*  bank your vote. What if there's bad weather? What if there's another God [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=27.32s)]
*  forbid hurricane or some other emergency on Election Day? My recommendation, vote [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=32.28s)]
*  early. Now it's not the system I want, we've talked about that a lot, but you [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=37.64s)]
*  can't change the system unless you win elections. I also highly recommend that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=42.04s)]
*  you assume, especially if you're in well Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=47.68s)]
*  Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, that your vote will decide this election [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=53.48s)]
*  because in a handful of swing states the margin, the margin of error is very very [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=60.31999999999999s)]
*  thin and especially if you live in those seven swing states that I just mentioned. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  It just is what it is and this race is too important to leave anything to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=70.0s)]
*  chance. Polls are interesting however, but there's only one poll that matters. That [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=75.56s)]
*  is what happens when we count the votes for the election. Don't let any poll, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=81.6s)]
*  good or bad, impact your thinking, your motions on this election. Let us be very [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=87.08s)]
*  clear, the American dream in my view is very much at stake. If Kamala Harris's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=92.28s)]
*  stated policies, her radicalism, extremism, is ever adopted in this country, I would [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=98.24s)]
*  argue that America that we know today will be unrecognizable in four years. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=105.24s)]
*  Democrats, the state-run media mob, they already are telling voters to scale back [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=109.36s)]
*  your ambitions about what you think the American dream is or as even the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=114.68s)]
*  Washington Post put it, quote, the new American dream comes with a smaller yard. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=119.56s)]
*  Why should we settle for less? Why should you settle for less? Why should your [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=126.08s)]
*  children and grandchildren settle for less? Don't we have an obligation to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=130.4s)]
*  leave this country in better shape than we found it like our parents did for us, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=134.24s)]
*  our grandparents did for all of us? You know, this kind of negative thinking has [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=138.28s)]
*  been around since Jimmy Carter was encouraging Americans to turn down their [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=142.2s)]
*  heat in the winter, put on a sweater, suffer in silence. Now coming up, we're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=146.84s)]
*  going to show you how the Harris campaign is now trying to normalize sky-high [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=151.48s)]
*  inflation, higher taxes, rising crime, mass illegal immigration with free sex [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=156.24s)]
*  change operations, but we begin with some good news. We do look at some polls, but [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=162.44s)]
*  again, don't let it impact you. The new USA Today-Soviet University poll has [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=166.64s)]
*  Donald Trump up by 11 points with Hispanic Americans. Now Trump lost this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=172.04s)]
*  growing demographic by 11 points in 2020. That's a 22-point swing, but as always, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  caution. Remember that Red Wave in 2022, the one we thought was coming, never [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=185.0s)]
*  materialized, and according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, fewer than [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  three in 10 men in Georgia are supporting Harris. Donald Trump is up by [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=194.44s)]
*  four, according to the AJC, and meanwhile early voting has been better than [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=199.88s)]
*  expected for the GOP, but don't take my word for it. Here's left-leading [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=204.2s)]
*  journalist Mark Halpern. Listen closely. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  If the early vote numbers stay the way they are, and that's a big if, we'll [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=210.76s)]
*  almost certainly know before election day who's going to win the election. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=215.92s)]
*  We're going to talk a lot about that. The reasons why Democrats might be [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=219.56s)]
*  underperforming, the prospect that they'll recover, but again, make no [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=223.44s)]
*  mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=227.56s)]
*  partially what the data's like, we'll know that Donald Trump's going to be [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=231.76s)]
*  president on election day. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=235.2s)]
*  Mark Halpern's a pretty smart guy. According to Fague News-CNN, the Harris [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=237.56s)]
*  campaign is now, quote, jittery. Meanwhile, NBC News reporting that campaign [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=241.76s)]
*  officials, they are worried that Michigan and or Wisconsin will fall and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=246.76s)]
*  North Carolina is now slipping away for the Democrats. But today, shockingly, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=250.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris, he took the day off. She kind of took it easy. With just, you [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  know, 14 days until the official election day, although every day is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=259.56s)]
*  election day, she didn't have a single rally. And now Donald Trump, rightly [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=263.44s)]
*  accusing his opponent of being, well, lazy as hell. Take a look. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=268.08s)]
*  We were in a race with some very sick people. They're liars. They just lie. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=273.0s)]
*  They lie about everything. And I was going to hit her really hard on the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=277.16s)]
*  trail today, but now I don't have to because she's off. She's off. No, I [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=281.16s)]
*  can't get home for it. Who the hell takes off? You have 14 days left and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  she'll take a couple of more days off too. You know why? She's lazy as hell [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=292.04s)]
*  and she's got that reputation. She's a radical left lunatic. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=295.4s)]
*  Donald Trump, he was in Florida today meeting with Hispanic business leaders [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  on Friday. He will sit down for one of the most popular podcasts in the country, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=305.16s)]
*  the Joe Rogan Experience. You don't want to miss that. We'll have highlights on [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=309.6s)]
*  Friday night. And tonight, Democrats, they're just in a state of utter panic. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  There's no other way to describe it. They can't run on Kamala's terrible record [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  or extreme beliefs, so they're going, well, repulsively negative. And now the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  smears, the slander, the besmirchment, the outright fear-mongering, it's never [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=328.56s)]
*  been worse. And I've been doing this a long time. Earlier tonight, President [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=333.8s)]
*  Biden accused Trump of wanting to shoot and to kill his political opponents and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=337.24s)]
*  seemingly vowed to lock him up. Take a look. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=342.2s)]
*  This is a guy who also wants to replace every civil servant, every single one, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=346.92s)]
*  thinks he has a right under the Supreme Court ruling on immunity to be able, if [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=352.8s)]
*  need be, if he, if it was the case, to actually eliminate, physically [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=357.44s)]
*  eliminate, shoot, kill someone who he needs to be the threat to. I mean, so I [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  know this sounds bizarre. It sounds like if I said this five years ago, you'd [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  lock me up. We've got to lock him up. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=374.84s)]
*  Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That's what we have to do. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=381.28s)]
*  Just for the record, the only candidate that it has been shot at in this election [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  is Donald Trump. He's also the only candidate facing prison time because of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=392.2s)]
*  multiple bogus, politically charged investigation from Harris and Biden's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=397.08s)]
*  weaponized Department of Justice. But Democrats want you to believe that Trump [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=402.08s)]
*  is the threat to democracy? Well, on this very question, even the Washington Post [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  poll shows Americans believe Kamala Harris is the bigger threat, not Donald [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump. Democrats are trying to gaslight the American people. That's all they've [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  got. And now our old friend, famed Democratic strategist James Carville, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=419.64s)]
*  clearly, I've known James well, I've debated him many times, clearly in a state [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=424.91999999999996s)]
*  of utter panic and becoming a little unglued. James, you might want one of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=429.84s)]
*  those gummies. Take a look. This is not an exaggeration. All right. This is not [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=434.8s)]
*  to say, well, he's really not, didn't mean he's gonna really like get rid of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=443.56s)]
*  Social Security, James. No, he is telling you right to your stupid face that he [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=447.44s)]
*  is going to use the military to arrest and suppress his political opponents. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=456.36s)]
*  But I'm sure that I and everybody else that does this for a living is gonna [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=463.12s)]
*  get asked, What about the swing voters in such and such a state that we know [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=470.36s)]
*  where they could all swing from the end of a rope? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=475.92s)]
*  Wow. Okay, James, you said in an interview, you like gummies and you took [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=480.84s)]
*  one the night that Joe Biden was debating Donald Trump. Maybe it's time. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=486.24s)]
*  You gotta chill a little bit. James, if anyone could try and tries to silence [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=489.64s)]
*  you, Rachel Maddow, afraid her show is gonna be canceled and everything. I will [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=493.96s)]
*  personally stand up for all of you and I will fight for your right to be wrong [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=498.88s)]
*  on the airwaves. I will fight for your freedom of speech. It is not true. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=504.4s)]
*  What is being said? It is fear mongering at the worst level. The only Democrat [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=510.0s)]
*  that actually got it right was Bill Maher. He was asked, Well, Donald Trump [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=514.56s)]
*  wins. What are you gonna do? He goes, Uh, I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna do my show [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=518.2s)]
*  and make jokes about Donald Trump. Uh, nobody's getting arrested. No political [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=522.4399999999999s)]
*  opponents are gonna be rounded up. Does anyone in the Democratic Party, by [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=527.68s)]
*  the way, have any self awareness at all? Apparently not because after after [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=531.24s)]
*  lecturing the American, you know, men last week like he did in accusing them [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=536.4s)]
*  of outright sexism, quote the brothers to quote Barack Obama, he's just [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=541.0s)]
*  perplexed. He just doesn't understand how America got so divided. What about [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  all the people who had their homes raided pre dawn raids, fake news, CNN [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=551.46s)]
*  cameras, all the people associated with Donald Trump, you know, arrested and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=556.12s)]
*  fingerprinted mugshot in. I guess what they're saying is they don't want [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=560.86s)]
*  what they did to Republicans done to them. And by the way, it shouldn't be [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=565.82s)]
*  done to them. It shouldn't have been done this time. But take a look. No, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=570.38s)]
*  this election is going to be tight. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=575.78s)]
*  It's gonna be tight here in Wisconsin is gonna be tight all across the country. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=579.48s)]
*  And [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=583.98s)]
*  it's gonna be tight because a lot of Americans are still struggling. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=586.38s)]
*  And people started feeling like no matter how hard they work, they were [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=589.4s)]
*  just treading water. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=593.8s)]
*  So I understand why folks are looking to shake things up. And I know it can be [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=596.5999999999999s)]
*  frustrating. Look, I do not watch cable news. I really don't. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=602.4s)]
*  I there are times where I just I don't understand how we got so toxic and just [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=608.0999999999999s)]
*  so divided and so bitter. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=617.3s)]
*  Notice he said treading water. He's acknowledging that for the last four [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=620.0999999999999s)]
*  years that Harris and Biden have failed. They now the Washington Post is talking [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=624.64s)]
*  about lowering your expectations. Maybe you'll have to buy a townhouse instead [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=631.04s)]
*  of a home with a backyard. But really, Barack, what I what I really want to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=635.0s)]
*  know, you know, I guess I'm one of those bitter Americans that cling to God guns, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  my religion, my faith, or maybe I'm just an irredeemable deplorable. I guess, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=645.5s)]
*  right? And if we believe Jesus is Lord, by the way, and you say it at a Kamala [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=651.12s)]
*  rally, guess what? They will tell you you are at the wrong rally. Anyway, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=655.5s)]
*  Biden Democrats that keep saying that Trump Republicans are a threat to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=660.8199999999999s)]
*  democracy. Well, why don't they run on the great economic success? Ask yourself [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  this. Their closing argument is fear, calling Trump racist and a threat to [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=669.4s)]
*  democracy. And of course, Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin. Why don't they run [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=674.1s)]
*  on the great success of the economy? Oh, that's right. Barack said we're [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=680.66s)]
*  treading water or that the border is safe and secure, which they told us for [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=684.5s)]
*  three years. That's not true. And how American towns and cities are more safe [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=689.4s)]
*  and more secure? No defund dismantled. No bail laws kind of stop that. And that [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=694.52s)]
*  you're paying a lot less at the pump for energy. No, we're paying about a [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=700.42s)]
*  buck, buck 50 more a gallon. And what a great economy we have and what low [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=705.18s)]
*  inflation we have. And we have a world. Well, we have war on two continents, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=710.12s)]
*  don't we? That's right. Nothing has gotten better under Harris and Biden and [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=715.34s)]
*  their failed policies. They've failed. Americans are suffering. It's an [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=721.5799999999999s)]
*  obvious time for change. And that's why we see nothing but smears and slander [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=725.74s)]
*  and dismergement and character assassination from the left. In fact, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=730.9s)]
*  Democrats and their friends in the state run media mob, they have compared [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=735.5600000000001s)]
*  almost every Republican to every evil, you know, leader in in memoriam from [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=739.74s)]
*  Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and on. And don't even get me started on the Russia [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=746.4200000000001s)]
*  hoax and the left's love of censorship in this country. Many on the left are [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=750.9200000000001s)]
*  even hyper partisan when it comes to trivial matters. Now, this week, the New [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=755.28s)]
*  York Times bashed Trump for not properly preparing french fries during his stop [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=759.72s)]
*  at McDonald's. Uh, and on TV, the hysteria was worse. Whoopi's upset that [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=765.02s)]
*  he didn't wear a hair net. Take a look. Forever. He was saying she never worked [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=771.4s)]
*  at McDonald's. You never know. Now he took himself to McDonald's. That was [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=776.56s)]
*  clothes and he wasn't wearing a hair net, which really bothered me. Yeah. No net. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=781.7800000000001s)]
*  Really? You I don't want your french fries. She actually worked in a [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=786.6600000000001s)]
*  McDonald's. She didn't go and pander and disrespect McDonald's workers by [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=791.8000000000001s)]
*  standing there in your red tie and take a picture. He worked briefly as a fry [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=796.5s)]
*  cooker without a hair net, I might add. Oh, like he carried weapons in a war [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=800.1600000000001s)]
*  zone that he never went to and that he was a head coach, but he wasn't. And [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=807.3599999999999s)]
*  that he said he had one rank in the military that he never achieved. Uh, we [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=812.5999999999999s)]
*  still don't have an answer to a pretty important question. Why is Kamala Harris [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=817.88s)]
*  even the nominee and not the guy that actually won the Democratic primary by [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=822.3199999999999s)]
*  millions of votes? Is that a threat to democracy tonight during an interview? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=826.2399999999999s)]
*  Kamala still could not answer that question. Take a look. Can you say that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=830.4399999999999s)]
*  you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those moments [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=835.1s)]
*  with President Biden as you were with him again and again repeatedly in that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=838.26s)]
*  time? Of course. Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=841.74s)]
*  and capable in every way that anyone would want if their president. You never [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=853.58s)]
*  saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=859.6600000000001s)]
*  him. It was a bad debate. People have bad debates. He is absolutely. But [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=862.64s)]
*  that's the reason why you're here and he's not running for the top of the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=868.88s)]
*  ticket. Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. What do you [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=872.24s)]
*  think? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAqeN5WSQ4&t=877.32s)]
