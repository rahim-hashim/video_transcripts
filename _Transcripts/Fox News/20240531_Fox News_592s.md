# The best revenge is success: Trey Gowdy
**Fox News:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA)
*  Anyway, joining us with reaction, Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley, the host of Sunday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=0.0s)]
*  Night in America. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=4.8s)]
*  Fox News' Trey Gowdy is with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=5.8s)]
*  Guys, good to see you both. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Jonathan, you've been with us from the beginning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=8.84s)]
*  Look, I was pretty realistic. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=11.08s)]
*  We both communicated often, on air and off air. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  I think this is a culmination of the weaponization of our system of justice, now for a long time, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=19.36s)]
*  for people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=26.88s)]
*  I think it's an extraordinarily dangerous time for America. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  If you look at everything that we talked about, and the judge and the conflicts that he had, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=32.44s)]
*  and the judge being a Biden donor, and what the judge allowed in closing arguments and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=38.16s)]
*  jury instructions, the way he treated the defense in this case, when you put it all [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=44.42s)]
*  together, it really isn't surprising, is it? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=49.4s)]
*  No, it's not surprising. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=53.64s)]
*  The instructions had that feel, I called it in a column yesterday of a can't-hunt, where [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=56.88s)]
*  you actually shoot game in a cage, because in defense of some of those jurors, they may [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=61.92s)]
*  have not seen any alternative but conviction. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, keep in mind, this judge allowed the government to repeatedly tell them that it [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=71.4s)]
*  was a fact that an election violation occurred and that Trump had ordered it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=76.04s)]
*  Judge Mershon stayed absolutely silent during that statement over and over again, even though [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=81.84s)]
*  it violated his instruction. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=87.14s)]
*  And to this day, we won't know what the jury really decided on the conspiracy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  I was in that courtroom listening to 34 guilty verdicts, but they didn't say what the jury [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=96.56s)]
*  thought had happened. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  They were unanimous only that some crime, some secondary crime occurred. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=105.88s)]
*  Judge Mershon did not require them to reach unanimity on what that crime was. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=111.08s)]
*  So it's going to go on appeal, and the appellate court won't know any more than we have in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  terms of knowledge as to was this an election violation, another falsification of documents, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  a tax violation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=130.12s)]
*  That's just simply not in the record. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, and Trey, let me bring you in here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=135.24s)]
*  This was a point that Jonathan had made and I've made over and over again. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=138.28s)]
*  The jury had been told dozens and dozens of times that the payments were campaign violations, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=142.4s)]
*  especially in closing, that six-hour closing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=147.36s)]
*  The judge let all of that go uncontradicted in this case. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=150.76s)]
*  Then you have the issue of, you know, the 4-4-4, where you could just think he's guilty. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  You can have one group thinking he's guilty for—four people think he's guilty for A, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=160.6s)]
*  four for B, four for C. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=165.52s)]
*  Well, that is a direct violation of the U.S. Supreme Court decision, the 2020 decision [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=167.16s)]
*  of Ramos v. Louisiana, Andres v. the U.S. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=174.44s)]
*  But again, this was allowed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  Now, I believe it's overturned on appeal, but when's that appeal going to happen, Trey? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  Did you ever see anything like this? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=184.64s)]
*  You know, you're a prosecutor. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=186.2s)]
*  I don't think you ever lost a case. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=188.04s)]
*  Well, the jury was unanimous, Sean, in its lack of unanimity. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=191.56s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=197.8s)]
*  I tried cases where I had to prove an additional crime. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=199.28s)]
*  Every death penalty case, you have to prove murder plus something else beyond a reasonable [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=203.0s)]
*  doubt, and the verdict—the jury has to specify what that additional crime is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=207.68s)]
*  As Jonathan and I sit here tonight, we can't tell you whether it was one of those three, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=214.28s)]
*  or whether it was some other crime that's nebulous that we don't know about. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=220.16s)]
*  I came last week to this courtroom. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=226.52s)]
*  I'd heard rumors that the judge was pro-prosecution. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=229.88s)]
*  Look, I was a prosecutor, as you pointed out. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=232.16s)]
*  I spent four days in the courtroom. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=235.32s)]
*  Not just pro-prosecution, Sean. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=238.88s)]
*  I mean, I cannot—I would struggle to think of a significant objection by the defense [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=240.92s)]
*  that was actually sustained, and the tone with which he treated the counsel was disparate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=246.36s)]
*  He let the prosecutor—I mean, Andy and Jonathan and I were talking about the defense, I think, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=254.12s)]
*  failed to object sometimes during the prosecution closing argument because they had battered [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=261.88s)]
*  lawyer syndrome. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=266.76s)]
*  They had just been beaten up for weeks and weeks. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=268.16s)]
*  So will it be overturned on appeal? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=271.48s)]
*  I can think of five different ways that it can be, but I don't think it'll happen before [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=273.72s)]
*  the election, which to your other point, the best revenge is success. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=278.6s)]
*  If you want a justice system that doesn't elect a district attorney who promises to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=284.6s)]
*  go after a political opponent, then you need to win at the ballot box. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=289.0s)]
*  I mean, Alvin Brack—name me another crime that he's gotten really, really exercised [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=292.88000000000005s)]
*  about. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=297.8s)]
*  It's not shoplifting. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=298.8s)]
*  It's not stealing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=299.8s)]
*  It's not hitting people on the street. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=300.8s)]
*  It is alleged hush money to keep someone quiet about a sexual encounter. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=303.06s)]
*  That's what really gets his attention. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=309.18s)]
*  An eight-year-old case over a $130,000 payment, you know, you really—it does boggle the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=311.9s)]
*  mind. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=318.9s)]
*  A misdemeanor of statute of limitations have run out, but somehow—when did a local New [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=319.9s)]
*  York City courtroom become a place to try a federal election crime, Jonathan Turley? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=326.02s)]
*  That seems rather novel to me as well, or a federal tax crime. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=332.61999999999995s)]
*  Well, that's what was so maddening about Brack's comments tonight, when he kept on saying, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=336.61999999999995s)]
*  no, this is just standard stuff. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=343.38s)]
*  You know, at some point, you just strange credulity. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=345.26s)]
*  You have to admit this has never been attempted before. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  Even other networks have said that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=352.78s)]
*  Other networks have said that this wouldn't have been brought against anyone other than [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=354.78s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  That's something that if you're an honest person, you have to accept. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=359.34000000000003s)]
*  This was a political use of the criminal justice system to create this novel effort. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=362.86s)]
*  And I think in the end, what you have to tell people who are upset about this is Manhattan [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=370.58000000000004s)]
*  is not the entirety of this nation. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=376.86s)]
*  We're bigger than this case. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=379.74s)]
*  We're bigger than this district. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=381.48s)]
*  We have a system that has proven itself over and over again in history, but we all have [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=383.42s)]
*  to take a leap of faith. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=388.12s)]
*  We have to take a breath. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=389.35999999999996s)]
*  But Jonathan, let me ask you, if I may. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=390.35999999999996s)]
*  As Blanche said today. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=392.35999999999996s)]
*  We have a weaponized Department of Justice under Joe Biden. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  Remember, the third highest ranking official left that prestigious position to come in [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=399.64s)]
*  and work on this case. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=403.96s)]
*  You know, do you agree with me that that DOJ is weaponized? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=405.32s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear it is. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, this case, I think, has really fulfilled the argument of many that you have a weaponized [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  system. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  The fact that Coangelo came from the third position in DOJ to help lead this case really [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  reaffirmed that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=425.12s)]
*  But, you know, being in that room, you had a sense of history and it was overwhelming. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=426.12s)]
*  The question is what history it made. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=433.36s)]
*  Yeah, they convicted a former president, but they may have also gotten this country to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=435.48s)]
*  focus in a way that has never happened before on the misuse of the legal system. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=440.92s)]
*  And so history may have been made in a different way. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=447.04s)]
*  This may galvanize Americans, including some that don't like Donald Trump, but they don't [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=449.16s)]
*  like what was done in this case to get Donald Trump. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=454.76s)]
*  And I had a feeling that of the sense of history in both ways in that courtroom. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=459.56s)]
*  Trey, we'll give you the last word. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  What do you think the outcome of this is? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=466.56s)]
*  Professor Dershowitz, who will join us later, thinks that this is really a precedent setting [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vnbBmbv4oA&t=469.20000000000005s)]
