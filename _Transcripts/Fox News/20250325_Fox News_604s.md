# Hannity reveals a secret about Democrats' 'outrage' over Trump team's chat leak
**Fox News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight she is the rising star in the Democratic Party, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=0.0s)]
*  almost every single day she makes news for all the wrong reasons. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=6.36s)]
*  Radical leftist Jasmine Crockett is now facing a formal censure in the House of Representatives [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=9.76s)]
*  after taunting Texas Governor Greg Abbott for using a wheelchair. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=16.32s)]
*  How low can you sink? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=20.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=21.88s)]
*  Um, y'all know we got Governor Hot Wheels down there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=22.88s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=28.28s)]
*  By the way, coming up tonight, Governor Abbott will join us to respond, but as you can see, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=29.48s)]
*  the so-called party love and compassion and peace is no longer even pretending to have [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=34.72s)]
*  any empathy or even basic common sense. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=40.52s)]
*  Democrats now represent the party of rage and anger, resentment, intolerance, hatred [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=43.84s)]
*  for anyone that dares to disagree with their radical worldview. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=47.94s)]
*  Instead of working to improve life in America, to help working men and women, they obsessively [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=52.08s)]
*  move from one political smear campaign to the next and cheer for America's failure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=58.06s)]
*  And this week, well, the latest obsession session just dropped after a high level White [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=63.220000000000006s)]
*  House text exchange about strikes in Yemen accidentally leaked a far left media into [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=67.58s)]
*  a far left media hacks somehow signal messaging named Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=74.26s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=79.10000000000001s)]
*  It's obviously a very serious mistake on the part of whoever included Goldberg in this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=80.76s)]
*  highly classified chain of command messaging that went on that involved war plants. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  The idea that instead all these Trump deputies were hanging out chatting on signal instead, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=96.78s)]
*  that is very noteworthy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=102.68s)]
*  That's going to raise a lot of red flags. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  All this information about a strike that happened was imminent. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=105.92s)]
*  I think about all the different ways that people's lives were in danger. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=112.48s)]
*  This is so utterly ridiculous. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=116.76s)]
*  It's not only a national embarrassment. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=118.36s)]
*  This is a national emergency. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=120.2s)]
*  It's stunning. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=122.0s)]
*  It's likely the biggest national security debacle that any professional can remember. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=123.72s)]
*  Breathless hysteria from even Humpty Dumpty made a return appearance. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=131.32s)]
*  And liberal Joe, predictably, as you can see, the state run legacy media mob, they're [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=135.12s)]
*  all worked up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=140.28s)]
*  But, you know, here are the facts that they're not going to tell you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=141.28s)]
*  First, according to the director for national intelligence, no classified information was [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=144.4s)]
*  shared in this group exchange. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=149.12s)]
*  Two, signal, the encrypted messaging app used for the conversation is approved for government [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=151.2s)]
*  use. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=156.88s)]
*  It was actually even preloaded onto our CIA director's government phone. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=157.88s)]
*  Three, perhaps most importantly, something they'll never think about, the military [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  mission thankfully was a complete success. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=167.0s)]
*  Now, of course, it's not acceptable for a reporter from the Atlantic to be accidentally [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  included in a group policy discussion at the White House, but this was a one-off. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=174.88s)]
*  This was an accident, not a nationwide crisis. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=180.2s)]
*  On ex-retired Green Beret military planner, Congressman Keith Self, described it this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=183.64s)]
*  way, quote, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=188.8s)]
*  Fast moving coordination immediately prior to any operation is absolutely necessary. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=189.8s)]
*  This was a successful, precision military operation, period. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=195.4s)]
*  This incident carried no adverse consequences at all. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  The deceptive story makes a mountain out of a molehill. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=204.12s)]
*  Good characterization. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=207.16000000000003s)]
*  The congressman is right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  And I'll take it a step further. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  Let me let you all in on a little secret. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  What is an undeniable truth of life? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=215.08s)]
*  Most Democrats, most members of that state-run corrupt legacy media mob that are dead and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=217.8s)]
*  that have no influence, just don't know it yet, they don't actually care about this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=223.96s)]
*  story. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=230.08s)]
*  Pay attention. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=231.08s)]
*  Per usual. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=232.08s)]
*  It is simply more feign, phony, moral outrage. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=233.08s)]
*  You know, now, how do I know that I'm correct? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  How do we know, you know, that this is not real? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, in case you forgot, national security was not a top priority of concern for Democrats [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=243.4s)]
*  or the media in the past few years. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=248.6s)]
*  In fact, they had no problem when Joe Biden created the single biggest preventable national [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=252.16s)]
*  security crisis ever in our history when he opened the floodgates at our southern border, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=257.58s)]
*  letting in known terrorists, criminals, murderers, rapists, gang members, cartel members and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  millions of other unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=270.16s)]
*  The very same people now are pretending that they care about national security breaches. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=272.96s)]
*  They were the exact same partisans that flat out lied day in and day out for four years. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=278.88s)]
*  And they told all of you that the border was secure and the border was closed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=285.88s)]
*  They also lied about Biden's obvious cognitive decline. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=290.9s)]
*  Now, a president's cognitive decline, that would be a clear and present danger to our [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=294.4s)]
*  national security. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=299.98s)]
*  But the radical left, these very same people that are so outraged today, they did not care. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=301.74s)]
*  And they lied. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=307.56s)]
*  And they all covered it up. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=308.56s)]
*  They all knew. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=309.86s)]
*  In fact, DOJ Special Counsel Robert Herr determined that Biden was so out of it, was handing out [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=310.86s)]
*  state secrets like candy to his ghostwriter for an upcoming autobiography. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=317.44s)]
*  Did any of these hyperventilating Democrats, media people, did they care at that moment [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=323.34s)]
*  when it really mattered, day in and day out, when they were all lying about it? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=329.24s)]
*  This was systemic institutional lying that they went along with. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=333.84s)]
*  That means they don't really care about what happened in this particular case. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  They are feigning outrage. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=342.48s)]
*  And remember, Herr didn't charge the former president with a crime because Joey was an [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=344.0s)]
*  elderly man that had a very poor memory and would be unfit for trial. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=349.56s)]
*  Democrats, the media mob, they didn't care. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  They attacked Herr. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=356.52s)]
*  They defended Biden. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=357.52s)]
*  They were also unconcerned with Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=358.8s)]
*  That resulted in the horrific deaths of 13 innocent U.S. service members. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=364.0s)]
*  They also caused a flood of unvetted refugees out of Afghanistan. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=368.52s)]
*  And don't forget the billions and billions of dollars worth of very sophisticated U.S. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=373.82s)]
*  military equipment that was left behind for the Taliban, the very same group that helped [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=378.78s)]
*  facilitate 9-11-01. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=383.32s)]
*  And to add insult to injury, Biden also abandoned Bagram Air Base, which is now vulnerable [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=385.58s)]
*  to neighboring China. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=391.78s)]
*  Well, filling the gap. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=393.3s)]
*  And speaking of China, you might recall General Milley in 2021, the now-disgraced former chairman [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  of the Joint Chiefs, was accused of sharing U.S. intel with China, even reportedly promised [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=401.18s)]
*  his Chinese counterpart a heads-up if the United States planned to launch an attack, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=407.02s)]
*  If we're going to attack, I'm going to call you ahead of time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=412.54s)]
*  It's not going to be a surprise. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=416.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=418.5s)]
*  Eliminating the element of surprise if we needed it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=419.5s)]
*  Not a good idea. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=422.26000000000005s)]
*  According to a report in The Washington Post, he also attempted to assert the president's [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=423.70000000000005s)]
*  nuclear authority. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=428.3s)]
*  This is when President Trump was in office. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=429.3s)]
*  This was a huge scandal. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=431.70000000000005s)]
*  But once again, the state-run legacy media mob, the Democratic Party, they did not hoot. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  They did not howl. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=438.86s)]
*  They did not feign moral outrage. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=439.86s)]
*  They did not bang on desks. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=441.86s)]
*  They did not talk about national security. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=443.06s)]
*  They just didn't care when he even demanded that any nuclear launch go through him. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=445.38s)]
*  No wonder he needed a preemptive pardon. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=452.34s)]
*  So now, the outrage from the left over a reporter accidentally being added, a one-off, one-time, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXbuF1B2T8&t=454.74s)]
