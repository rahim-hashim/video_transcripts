# Netanyahu: We will continue to achieve victory over our enemies
**Fox News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc)
*  And joining us now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is with us. Mr. Prime Minister, great to have you back sir. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=7.46s)]
*  First, once again, my condolences, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=9.66s)]
*  after all your country has been through, the equivalent of 40,000 dead Americans a day [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=13.3s)]
*  in a single day and murder and rape and kidnapping and torture and beheading and now, you know, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=18.34s)]
*  a four, five, six, seven front war, it's been rough for Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=24.64s)]
*  How's the country holding up? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=30.06s)]
*  Well, it's holding up remarkably because of the spirit of our people and the indomitable courage of our soldiers and the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=33.82s)]
*  resolution of our government to roll back this tide of terror, this murderous mass, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=42.44s)]
*  hit Hamas and hit the Iran axis that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=50.24s)]
*  sponsors Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and is committed to destroy Israel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=53.68s)]
*  They thought we were just gonna fold and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=58.12s)]
*  a year and some later, they're folding and we're gonna continue until we achieve [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  victory over our enemies that are your enemies because these people chant death to America, death to Israel, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=66.4s)]
*  you're the great Satan, we're the small Satan, but we're standing in their way. Well, we're defeating them and our victory is your victory. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=72.64s)]
*  You stood with America after 9-11 [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=81.18s)]
*  on this program, on with me many, many times. I'll never forget it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=84.72s)]
*  Yesterday was historic and you actually used the phrase [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=89.6s)]
*  that Donald Trump is the greatest friend Israel's ever had in the White House. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=93.72s)]
*  Explain. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=98.28s)]
*  It's that simple. He's the greatest friend Israel ever had in the White House, you know, in his first term. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  He recognized Jerusalem as our capital and moved the American Embassy there, recognized our sovereignty over the Golan Heights, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  got out of the disastrous Iran deal, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=113.4s)]
*  brokered, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  and we worked together on this, the historic Abraham Accords that brought peace to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=119.72s)]
*  Israel and for Arab states. You want more? I mean, that's a lot and look what he's done in the last few days. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=125.44s)]
*  I mean, he's done remarkable things. He's released the ammunition that we need to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=131.24s)]
*  continue in our march to victory. He's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=137.0s)]
*  taken action against [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=140.74s)]
*  UNRWA and these other UN agencies that hate America and hate Israel. He's done [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=142.66s)]
*  enormous things and yes, he's the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=147.86s)]
*  You said that you believe peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only feasible, you think it's going to happen and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=153.54s)]
*  President Trump, I'll juxtapose that with what he said about Gaza and how Gaza has been [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=162.14s)]
*  basically turned into rubble and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  you know, he talked about that America would go in, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=169.98s)]
*  dismantle the dangerous [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=173.66s)]
*  unexploded bombs, level the site, rid the site of destroyed buildings and create an economic [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=175.22s)]
*  development that would simply supply unlimited jobs, housing for people in the area and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=182.78s)]
*  really make it a place worth living in. Is that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=188.66s)]
*  anything you expected and do you share that belief and what do you make of American media taking that? He's taking over Gaza. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=192.34s)]
*  He sounds like he's rebuilding Gaza to me. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I don't think he talked about sending US troops to complete the job of destroying Hamas. That's our commitment. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=203.46s)]
*  That's our job and we're absolutely committed to it. And I also don't think he said that he's going to fund it. He said that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=210.34s)]
*  neighboring states, wealthy states, would do it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=217.68s)]
*  But the actual idea of allowing for his Gazans who want to leave to leave, I mean, what's wrong with that? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=219.74s)]
*  They can leave, they can then come back, they can relocate and come back, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  but you have to rebuild Gaza. If you want to rebuild Gaza, you can't have... [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=230.06s)]
*  This is the first good idea that I've heard. It's a remarkable idea. And I think it should be really pursued, examined, pursued [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  and done because I think it will create a different future for everyone. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  Two things the president said yesterday. One is that we have to ensure Hamas is eliminated and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=248.06s)]
*  restore peace to that area. And the second thing he said is Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=254.46s)]
*  You are the first [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=261.7s)]
*  leader of a state, you're the first prime minister, the first president, to come visit the White House in his second term. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=264.42s)]
*  Between the reports that I read, even in the New York Times and elsewhere and my sources, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=273.62s)]
*  we keep hearing that Iran is very close to nuclear capability. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=279.74s)]
*  I don't have the intelligence you have, I don't know what our country's intelligence has, but all indications are they want a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=283.94s)]
*  Am I leaning into something that I shouldn't lead into? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=293.14s)]
*  Was this in a sort of an emergency meeting about the state of Iran? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=298.66s)]
*  Well, there's no question Iran is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=305.18s)]
*  gearing up to get nuclear weapons. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  They probably would have been there ten years ago already if we hadn't taken various actions to hold them up. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=309.66s)]
*  We held them up, we slowed them down, but we haven't stopped them completely. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=316.26000000000005s)]
*  So yes, they're seeking to do that. And of course we discussed this and the president said something very simple, which I said as well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=321.66s)]
*  Iran must not be allowed to have nuclear weapons. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=329.42s)]
*  You know, it's that simple and it's just about all I can say about it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=333.22s)]
*  Iran should not have nuclear weapons. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=339.74s)]
*  Well, they can have nuclear weapons. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=342.86s)]
*  I would think, you know, the president talking about other countries in the region, Egypt, Jordan, the Saudis, the Emirates, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  I would think it's in their best interest to help resolve the issues in Gaza and Hamas and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  Lebanon and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad and the Houthi rebels. I think it's in everyone's best interest. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=358.38s)]
*  But I think they all would unite [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=363.98s)]
*  against an Iran, they would fight against Iranian hegemony and power with a nuclear weapon. I would think they all want that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=366.58s)]
*  Well, I think it's a common knowledge that the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=376.5s)]
*  most of the Arab countries have shifted from seeing Israel as their great [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=380.34s)]
*  enemy to seeing Iran as their great enemy. They don't often say it, they often hide it, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=386.14s)]
*  but they recognize that Israel is the one country in the Middle East that fought Iran. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=391.78000000000003s)]
*  We fight Iran. Iran openly declares its goal to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=396.62s)]
*  destroy us. We didn't seek that conflict. They seek it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=400.94s)]
*  They openly say that they will wipe out the Jewish state and they openly say that their goal is not merely the Jewish state, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=404.5s)]
*  but to conquer the Middle East and go beyond that and also blackmail the United States with nuclear weapons. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=411.38s)]
*  So in resisting this and taking action against this, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=417.02s)]
*  we're not only doing it for our own survival, but again for the interests of many countries in the region, the US interests as well. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=420.78000000000003s)]
*  I think the interest of peace in the world. You don't want a world in which the Aitolus have [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=428.6s)]
*  nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. That's not going to produce peace. That's going to produce [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=434.18s)]
*  the most horrible of wars. It has to be stopped. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=439.74s)]
*  Do you believe, and you were pretty confident that all the hostages that are alive will be returned? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=443.18s)]
*  You are confident of that? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=449.66s)]
*  Well, it's first of all a goal that we set. We set three goals vis-a-vis Gaza. One, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=452.94s)]
*  destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities. Two, release all the hostages. And three, ensure that Gaza does not [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=457.78000000000003s)]
*  pose a threat to Israel anymore. And we're committed to achieving all three. So far, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=465.74s)]
*  we've decimated most of Hamas's military power. Not all. There's some left. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=470.58000000000004s)]
*  And we'll make sure that it's not there when this war ends and it could end very quickly. Second, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=474.98s)]
*  we've released so far about 70 percent, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=481.54s)]
*  more than that actually, of the live hostages, which nobody believed we would do. And we're committed to getting everyone out. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  Both the living hostages and unfortunately also the dead hostages, which Hamas also keeps. That cruel. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=492.90000000000003s)]
*  They're so monstrous. They actually keep bodies as hostages, too. It's just incredible. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=500.41999999999996s)]
*  So yes, we intend to commit to do that. I won't talk here how we intend to do it, but it's [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=505.18s)]
*  something that is in my mind. It's also in the president's mind. We don't leave it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=511.97999999999996s)]
*  My last question to you, back to Donald Trump. When Donald Trump, before he got into office and he said all hell will break [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=516.58s)]
*  loose in the region, if those [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=525.14s)]
*  hostages are not released, how important were those words in your view to getting this deal done to get the hostages back? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=527.9s)]
*  I think he used his influence, which is global. I think he used it with great effect to help us complete this [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=537.38s)]
*  release, and I'm sure that working together will achieve great things. We intend to, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=545.26s)]
*  we're changing the Middle East. Israel has already done so in the last year. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=551.8199999999999s)]
*  We've really changed the Middle East. It was basically an Iranian pond. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=556.1s)]
*  They can do anything in it, and we in many ways single-handedly, but with some American air defense support, which I appreciate, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=559.78s)]
*  I don't, and some other help that I appreciate as well. But Trump's entry into the White House gives [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=566.5s)]
*  enormous, enormous, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=574.1800000000001s)]
*  I say backing to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=577.38s)]
*  those who wish to see Iran's aggression rolled back, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=579.38s)]
*  Iran never having a nuclear weapon, and that affects the entire region. It [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=583.74s)]
