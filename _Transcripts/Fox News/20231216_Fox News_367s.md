# Victor Davis Hanson: Biden is in a 'doom loop'
**Fox News:** [December 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk)
*  Joining us now with reaction, Democratic strategist Doug Schoen, Fox News contributor Joe Concha, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=0.0s)]
*  and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Victor Davis Hansen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=5.96s)]
*  Doug, I want to start with you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  The president has been firm in saying, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=13.02s)]
*  And I have said, I don't see a universe where President Biden doesn't run. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=16.52s)]
*  But I did see those two pieces, the Axios piece and then I see the political one, that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=20.84s)]
*  it's an ever-present weight, Hunter's legal troubles. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=25.28s)]
*  So do you think that there's any chance he pulls back from his run? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=28.6s)]
*  You know, Kayleigh, a month or two ago, I would have agreed with you and said, no chance [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  he's not running. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=38.28s)]
*  And I think in his mind today, he is running. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=39.28s)]
*  But that being said, with poll numbers as bad as his numbers, with an approval of 33 [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=42.96s)]
*  percent, and with the impeachment inquiry having been opened and his obvious cognitive [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=49.6s)]
*  I think he'll have a family meeting over the holidays and whether he decides to run or [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=56.16s)]
*  not ultimately, I still think is an open question. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=61.68s)]
*  So I think this is an evolving story. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=65.28s)]
*  And let's stay tuned and wait till January. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=67.62s)]
*  Yeah, very interesting. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=70.96s)]
*  Victor, I want to come to you because I want to give a word of warning to viewers. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  The polls haven't always been right. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=78.6s)]
*  There was supposed to be a red wave. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=80.28s)]
*  There was not. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=82.24s)]
*  When you look at Trump and the voters he's bringing in, he's bringing in young voters, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=83.4s)]
*  he's bringing in all kinds of new voters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=86.76s)]
*  But non-2020 voters in the CNN poll, he's winning by 26 in Georgia and 40 in Michigan. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  But you've got to make a non-2020 voter show up in 2024. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  You've got to get out the vote. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I think it's a little different, Kayleigh. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  I think he's in a doom loop. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=106.44s)]
*  It's not just the polls. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=107.92s)]
*  None of his agenda is polling. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=109.76s)]
*  Anything he's done is polling 50%. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=112.16s)]
*  He's got some really problems with the Biden family conglomerate. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=115.0s)]
*  Finally, the news of their skullduggery is it's unassailable. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=119.0s)]
*  And then in addition to that, he's got—I'll be frank, he's in severe cognitive decline. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=125.0s)]
*  And when you add all of that up—corruption, decline, low polls, an unpopular agenda—the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=132.84s)]
*  result is we're in Ennui. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=138.0s)]
*  There's lethargy now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=139.56s)]
*  We've seeded the Red Sea over to the Yemeni terrorists. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=140.72s)]
*  You can't navigate it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  We have had 125 attacks on our installations in Iran, and then we're not doing anything. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=146.0s)]
*  There's no border. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=152.0s)]
*  It's not that it's porous. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=153.0s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=154.0s)]
*  And then they're infighting to take up that vacuum in the White House, because we hear [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=155.0s)]
*  that Kamala Harris thinks we should be more sympathetic to Hamas or that people are saying [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=159.0s)]
*  natural gas, but at the same time, we've got to produce more gas than we ever have. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=165.52s)]
*  So because of this decline and this vacuum, people are freelancing around him with different [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=169.36s)]
*  agendas that are not compatible, and overseas people see nothing's getting done. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  And they're taking advantage of that vacuum, and they're our enemies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=179.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=182.12s)]
*  I mean, that's a good summary. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=183.12s)]
*  And Joe—you know, for Joe Biden to win, though, he needs to make Democrats come home. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=185.88s)]
*  When you look at his approval rating, which is almost in the 20s, shocking to say, he's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=190.6s)]
*  lost 12 points among Democrats. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=194.92s)]
*  Do you think they come home? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=197.44s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=200.88s)]
*  He's losing among black voters. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=201.88s)]
*  He's losing among female voters, independent voters, young voters. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=203.12s)]
*  All the people that helped him barely win in 2020, they are leaving and probably not [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=207.24s)]
*  coming back, because the thought process is, Kaley, will this president get better with [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=212.42s)]
*  age? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=216.64s)]
*  Will he be like Bill Clinton, the comeback kid? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=217.64s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=219.44s)]
*  He's not whine. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=221.44s)]
*  He's not going to get better with age. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=222.44s)]
*  And then when you think about the version of Joe Biden as an 86-year-old in the Oval [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=223.44s)]
*  Office if he won a second term, it's hard for any Democrat, really, to imagine that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  And no president, Kaley, has ever been reelected with an approval rating below 40 percent. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=232.8s)]
*  And as Doug pointed out, we're now seeing several polls putting him at 33 percent. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=236.44s)]
*  So apparently, political rock bottom has a basement. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=240.44s)]
*  And by the way, have you seen the president's schedule today? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=242.84s)]
*  And I'm not just cherry-picking, because this is a lot of days. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  10 a.m., he got the daily intelligence brief, because terrorists apparently like to sleep [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=248.32s)]
*  in on Fridays. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=252.52s)]
*  And then 1230, he had lunch with the vice president. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=253.64s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=256.68s)]
*  That's when the weekend began, despite everything happening in the world. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=257.68s)]
*  People see this, they know it, and you cannot spin it to the media. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=261.48s)]
*  Even they are starting to reject this notion that Joe Biden can serve another four years, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=265.76s)]
*  Kaley. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=270.12s)]
*  Doug, how do you reverse that perception? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=271.12s)]
*  That's a very difficult thing to do when the American public has their mind made up. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=274.12s)]
*  Well, I think Joe Biden gave us a hint, Kaley. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=278.64s)]
*  He said he wouldn't be running but for Donald Trump running again. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=282.56s)]
*  I think the playbook is to run the same campaign that was run in 2018, 2020, and 2022, which [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=286.24s)]
*  is a negative, full-out campaign against Donald Trump. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=293.96s)]
*  Because while it pains me to say as a Democrat, I can't disagree with what Victor said about [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=298.6s)]
*  how people feel about his performance and how objectively his performance should be [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=305.24s)]
*  judged. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=310.8s)]
*  The only saving grace for Biden is in some of those swing states, he's within the margin [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  of error, and Donald Trump's numbers, personally, are almost as low in some of those states [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=317.48s)]
*  as Joe Biden. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, he's trailing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=325.0s)]
*  It may be a death loop, but it can be a death loop for both candidates, which is what I [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=326.0s)]
*  think the Biden strategy would have to be. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=330.76s)]
*  Victor, I only have a moment here, but do you think Joe Biden's the nominee come next [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=335.32s)]
*  summer? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  I really don't, Kaley. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=341.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't know how the mechanism will transpire, but I think people in the Democratic Party [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  understand he's not cognitive able. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  And the idea of Kamala Harris assuming the presidency maybe before his term is over and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=350.08s)]
*  running as incumbent is one of their worst nightmares. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  So I'm not even sure he's going to finish his term. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=357.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's a scary thought. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=362.76s)]
*  Joe Conshott, Doug Shown, Victor Davis Hanson, thank you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZOWehaAuGk&t=364.04s)]
