# Dennis Quaid reveals favorite movie of his long career - and it may surprise you
**Fox News:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo)
*  All right, as we continue, actor Dennis Quaid stars in the new movie Reagan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=0.0s)]
*  It is a biographical drama about the life of former president Ronald Reagan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=5.84s)]
*  The film nearly doubled box office expectations on opening weekend, raking in an estimated [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=10.6s)]
*  $10 million. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=16.4s)]
*  By the way, the audience, they loved it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  98% score on Rotten Tomatoes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=20.68s)]
*  But of course, liberal Hollywood and the critics out there, they have been attacking the film [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=23.56s)]
*  left, right and sideways and predicting its demise, calling it propaganda simply because [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  it's an accurate movie about a Republican president. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=34.0s)]
*  Anyway, here with more Reagan star Dennis Quaid. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=37.44s)]
*  First of all, I love the fact that you more than doubled expectations at the box office. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=40.4s)]
*  I love the fact that the people like me that saw it, loved it and love your versatility [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=45.8s)]
*  as an actor, that you get a 98% score from the actual people that matter, the people [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=52.56s)]
*  that go to movie theaters, and it's doing so well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=59.24s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=63.6s)]
*  Well, thank you, Sean. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me on too, by the way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=67.44s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, 20% only 20% critics like the movie and 98% of the audience love the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=69.4s)]
*  movie. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=79.28s)]
*  It's actually the biggest gap in cinematic history for real. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=80.36s)]
*  And so we must be doing something right if we're getting reviews like that, Sean. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=84.4s)]
*  You know what you're doing something, you're doing something really right if you're getting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=90.2s)]
*  those reviews. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=93.52s)]
*  You know, one of the things when you're on my radio show, I talked to you about this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=94.52s)]
*  I am stunned at your versatility as an actor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  I'll be honest, I would never be able to be an actor. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=104.2s)]
*  I can't memorize lines. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=106.92s)]
*  I mean, this show is about as extemporaneous as possible. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=108.48s)]
*  You know, I'll write a monologue, but I have to use it and I add liberal around it, left, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=113.2s)]
*  right and sideways. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=118.4s)]
*  I do three hours of unscripted radio every day. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=119.4s)]
*  I would have a hard time memorizing lines like that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=121.88s)]
*  But more importantly, you have this ability. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=125.2s)]
*  Well, maybe don't sell yourself short there, Sean. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=126.88s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, well, try to get me to act like a liberal. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=131.64s)]
*  I think I'd probably, you know, have a heart attack and die. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=134.28s)]
*  But I watched you in the parent, everyone's watched The Parent Trap with their kids, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=139.28s)]
*  And that the movie's still a huge hit. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  And you're the nicest dad in the entire world. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  And then I go to, I must have watched, I can only imagine because I love the song by Mercy [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=148.8s)]
*  Me, the Christian contemporary band. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=153.52s)]
*  I just love the song. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  I love the story behind it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  And it's a true story. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  And you become the meanest father, the meanest SOB I've ever seen in my life. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=160.8s)]
*  You go from the nicest father to the meanest and you pull it off. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  And then to do a biography, that is the hardest thing to do, isn't it? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=171.64s)]
*  Well, I love playing real people, actually, because to get, like, for instance, Reagan, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  I didn't want to do an impersonation of him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=184.56s)]
*  And I wanted to find out something behind the personal, the public persona of him. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=186.68s)]
*  You know, it's for acting, it's what makes people tick. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=194.12s)]
*  That's what I'm interested in the most. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=196.84s)]
*  And I love doing different kinds of things. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=198.8s)]
*  And when I play real people, I like to have them there on the set. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=203.28s)]
*  Jerry Lee Lewis was on the set of Great Balls of Fire every day telling me, you're doing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=206.72s)]
*  it wrong, son. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=211.76s)]
*  But, you know, he was a good editor. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=212.76s)]
*  And I just love doing it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=216.16s)]
*  That's, what can I say? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=217.84s)]
*  But Reagan is actually my favorite movie of my entire career now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  I have a different judgment for that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=225.48s)]
*  It's about the time I had making it and also promoting it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=227.88s)]
*  And I'm just so gratified with it, to tell this story. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=231.8s)]
*  And people are responding in such a wonderful, wonderful way. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=237.28s)]
*  If you were born before 1985, you go to the theater, you get to remember how great this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=241.6s)]
*  country used to be. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  If you weren't born after 1985, you go and you'll see how great this country still can be. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=258.2s)]
*  Well, congratulations. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=259.2s)]
*  I couldn't be happier for you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=260.64s)]
*  I personally loved it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=261.8s)]
*  If this audience has not gone out and seen it yet, it's in theaters this weekend. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=263.52s)]
*  Dennis Quaid, great job. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=268.52s)]
*  Appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=269.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=270.92s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKd-W1gfFo&t=280.12s)]
