# 'STUNNED' Tim Scott reacts to Biden comments, says they are 'disgusting and despicable'
**Fox News:** [February 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w)
*  All right, so Joe Biden, yes, your president, he continues to demean Republicans, those [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=0.0s)]
*  MAGA Republicans, MAGA supporters. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And tonight, well, he is playing the race card yet again. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=7.4s)]
*  Now, speaking to a crowd of one of the several high-dollar off-camera fundraisers with his [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=10.96s)]
*  little notes, this one held in California this week, he reportedly said, quote, I've [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=16.66s)]
*  served with real racists. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=22.14s)]
*  I've served with Strom Thurmond. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=23.78s)]
*  I've served with all these guys that have set terrible records on race. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=25.88s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=30.44s)]
*  Those guys are worse, meaning these guys are worse. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=31.98s)]
*  Talking about Republicans, talking about modern-day Republicans. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=35.6s)]
*  Now, House Speaker Mike Johnson, well, he replied on ex-formerly known as Twitter, writing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=38.56s)]
*  that, quote, the least popular president to seek reelection is now so desperate and so [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=43.6s)]
*  underwater in the polls, he's playing the race card from the bottom of the deck. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=49.44s)]
*  Now, of course, Joe Biden neglected to mention that he formered with the former Klansman, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=54.08s)]
*  praised him as his mentor and a great guy, and said he was his dear friend. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=60.28s)]
*  And then, of course, he opposed with Robert Byrd the integration of public schools and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=65.72s)]
*  busing because he didn't want schools, in his words, to become racial jungles. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=71.44s)]
*  His words, not mine. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, here's a little trip down memory lane. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure Joe forgot all of this, but we'll remind him. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=80.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=83.76s)]
*  Madam President, we have predators on our streets. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=84.76s)]
*  You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=87.76s)]
*  I'm not joking. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=94.76s)]
*  What kind of a chance would a northeastern liberal like Joe Biden stand in the South? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=96.56s)]
*  Better than anybody else. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=101.76s)]
*  You don't know my state. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=103.26s)]
*  My state was a slave state. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=104.3s)]
*  We got the first sort of mainstream African American who was articulate and bright and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=105.8s)]
*  clean and nice-looking guy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=115.8s)]
*  I mean, that's a story. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=117.8s)]
*  You're going to put you all back in chains. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=119.8s)]
*  Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=121.8s)]
*  We got more questions. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=125.8s)]
*  You got more questions, but I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=126.8s)]
*  for me or Trump and you ain't black. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=130.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=135.8s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=136.8s)]
*  Now, let's not forget Biden's own vice president. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=137.8s)]
*  Vice President Harris called him out in that debate in the primary going back to 2020. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=140.8s)]
*  You might recall this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=145.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=147.8s)]
*  When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate working with segregationists [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=148.8s)]
*  to oppose busing, had I been in the United States Senate at that time, I would have been [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=153.8s)]
*  completely on the other side of the aisle. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=158.8s)]
*  And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=160.8s)]
*  And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=166.8s)]
*  to integrate her public schools. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=172.8s)]
*  And she was bused to school every day. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=174.8s)]
*  And that little girl was me. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=177.8s)]
*  Now, Joe Biden playing the race card like this, well, he's desperate, but it's deplorable. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=181.8s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=186.8s)]
*  It's repulsive. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=187.8s)]
*  But frankly, when your numbers are as low as his is, well, it's also fairly predictable. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=188.8s)]
*  Joe's struggling and he is clearly now more desperate than ever. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=193.8s)]
*  Joining us now, South Carolina Senator, our friend Tim Scott is back with us. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=196.8s)]
*  Senator, great to have you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=200.8s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=202.8s)]
*  Very much. Thank you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=203.8s)]
*  How disgusting and despicable are the comments of Joe Biden? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=204.8s)]
*  I just stunned. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=208.8s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know what to make of this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=210.8s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=212.8s)]
*  I really want you to give your full comments. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=213.8s)]
*  This guy opposed the integration of schools and busing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=217.8s)]
*  He didn't want public schools to be racial jungles. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=221.8s)]
*  Could you imagine the outcry of any Republican presidential candidate if they ever said something that repulsive? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=224.8s)]
*  The things that Joe Biden has said in the face of African Americans, despicable. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=233.8s)]
*  The actions he has taken as a member of the most elite governing body, the senator, incredible, disgusting. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=241.8s)]
*  Here's what we know about Joe Biden. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=249.8s)]
*  And we know this about liberals and progressives. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=251.8s)]
*  Whenever they are on the losing end of a conversation, a competition or an election, they do one thing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=254.8s)]
*  They go to race and class. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=263.8s)]
*  It's all they know. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=266.8s)]
*  It's the party of division. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=268.8s)]
*  It is the game of fear and it is disgusting. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=270.8s)]
*  Sean, we know without any question, this is the president who allows our southern border to be wide open, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=274.8s)]
*  devastating the economic opportunities of people today living in poverty. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=282.8s)]
*  We know that this is a president who's driven inflation to the highest levels since Jimmy Carter, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=287.8s)]
*  devastating African Americans, Hispanics, women and the majority population. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=295.8s)]
*  This is the president who has allowed our men and women in uniform to suffer through a commander in chief who seems to be asleep at the wheel. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=301.8s)]
*  Botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and instability in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=313.8s)]
*  While we have an open southern border with thousands of Chinese, thousands of people from the Middle East coming across our southern border, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=322.8s)]
*  he turns to race to get the attention off of his absolute failure as president and commander in chief of the greatest nation on God's green earth. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=332.8s)]
*  That's why we need four more years of Donald Trump. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=344.8s)]
*  We talked earlier. He's at 38% approval rating. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=349.8s)]
*  You've got 86% of the country saying this man is too old to be president four more years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=353.8s)]
*  I don't know how anybody overcomes those numbers. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=360.8s)]
*  We're watching what's happening with President Trump and I call it lawfare or the weaponization of our justice system. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=364.8s)]
*  They're targeting one man, one family, one organization. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=371.8s)]
*  I guess they want to keep Donald Trump if they can in court rather than out on the campaign trail. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=376.8s)]
*  But so far Donald Trump has been able to defy conventional political gravity and he survives this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=381.8s)]
*  But this will go on for the next, what, 256 days until election day. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=388.8s)]
*  How do you think that plays out? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=394.8s)]
*  Listen, every time I'm seriously just leaving a rally, just left the rally with Donald Trump, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=398.8s)]
*  thousands upon thousands of South Carolinians waiting outside to get in to hear the next president talk about the two tiered justice system. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=405.8s)]
*  How under President Biden, the Department of Justice and state's attorney generals hunt Republicans, not just him. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=415.8s)]
*  Because if they'll do it to him, Sean, they'll do it to me and you know they'll do it to you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=424.8s)]
*  Here's a man, Donald Trump, willing to stand in the fire to keep America safe, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=429.8s)]
*  to keep Americans safe from a two tiered weaponized justice system. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=435.8s)]
*  This is the man who can take the heat in the kitchen and come out without a single shred of anything on him. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=442.8s)]
*  No beads of sweat, no dust on his shoulders. He is ready for the fight. It's Joe Biden. He has to go down. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=452.8s)]
*  As he just said, let's fire Joe Biden. Let's hire Donald Trump and get inflation down, crime down. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=459.8s)]
*  Let's refund the police, not defund the police. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=466.8s)]
*  All that we're seeing in lawfare is an attempt to distract the American voter and Donald Trump from the mission at hand. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ne4vY-i8w&t=470.8s)]
