# Newt Gingrich: Bret Baier ‘disrupted' Kamala Harris’ rhythm
**Fox News:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw)
*  Here with reaction Fox News contributor former speaker of the house newt gingrich is with us mr. Speaker [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=0.0s)]
*  So she was lying filibustering blaming Trump. You know, they're calling him a fascist of Nazi. They're playing the race card [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=4.72s)]
*  Put it all together. What does this tell you about? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=12.1s)]
*  Where they think this race is with 21 days to go [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=15.66s)]
*  First of all, I just want to say I thought that bread bear did an amazing job [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=21.14s)]
*  And a comment that Charlemagne the god had said in the radio show [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=26.04s)]
*  she filibusters and Brett broke into her filibuster and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=30.08s)]
*  Disrupted her rhythm and I think was generally a very bad night for her [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=34.92s)]
*  Not because Brett was biased but because he kept going back to the record and back to the truth and back to clear questions now [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=40.36s)]
*  Here I want to be very clear [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=48.68s)]
*  About how really worried I am [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=52.16s)]
*  You have two [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=55.12s)]
*  enormous threats that are out there that are totally outside the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  American tradition the first [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=62.64s)]
*  Which you've indicated a little bit of tonight is people who are on the left so paranoid so frightened [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=65.28s)]
*  So out of touch with reality. You don't know what they're gonna do and I think this is a very real problem [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  With almost a mental health kind of problem, but it could have very direct [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=80.84s)]
*  Very real consequences, you know for a long time they thought that the effort to impeach Trump would stop him [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=86.52s)]
*  Then they thought that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=93.0s)]
*  January 6th would stop him then they thought that the courts would stop him [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=95.04s)]
*  He just keeps coming and I think at some point the desperation of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=99.72s)]
*  Those on the left who see him legitimately as the end of their world, which is what he is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  What could lead to? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=112.0s)]
*  Activities that really we have to worry about a lot the other thing which I don't think talked about enough [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  The Iranians have clearly said they want to kill Trump [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=119.64s)]
*  Now I've been delighted that speaker Johnson has spoken up and said bluntly [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  That an Iranian attack on an American political leader would in fact be an act of war and would lead to war and even [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=130.76000000000002s)]
*  President Biden has said that attacking an American leader would be an act of war and but I think we need to be really concerned [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  Because the Iranians have a long history of trying to kill people and assassinate people and so between those two [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=146.44000000000003s)]
*  I think we have to have a constant concern for the safety of President Trump because he's showing a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=153.4s)]
*  Enormous courage he continues to campaign he continues to be vulnerable [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=160.36s)]
*  He continues to be out with the American people and yet a tiny percent of the American people [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=165.08s)]
*  Virgin being crazy and the Iranians are [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=170.68s)]
*  Really have a long history of trying to kill people so that that's my biggest worry from I think [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=174.52s)]
*  Barring that Trump's gonna be the next president. I think he's gonna win and I think he may win by a shocking margin [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=180.4s)]
*  Let me ask you [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  Will these tactics of playing I want to get back to specifically what they're saying [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=188.84s)]
*  Because the rhetoric is ratcheted up [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=194.64s)]
*  I think we got a little bit of a glimpse of their closing argument today [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  And it's not are you better off than you are four years ago. It's fascist Nazi [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=199.88s)]
*  Race card lie blame Trump if the dog bites be stings if you're feeling sad will it work? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=206.04s)]
*  Look it's like being at the Thanksgiving dinner with your [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  Family and there are 30 or 40 members of the family there and two of them are insane and they've been drinking all afternoon [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  And they start saying things that are so crazy that the rest of the family hopes. They'll just go out back and be quiet [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=222.4s)]
*  These these kind of arguments are not going to work with normal Americans [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  They're gonna make you know Yale College professors excited. They're gonna make people at MSNBC excited [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=233.08s)]
*  But normal everyday Americans know this stuff is nuts [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  There's no evidence in four years of Trump presidency that he's in any way a threat to America [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=242.55999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, the only one that got it right was Bill Maher who said [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  Trump wins. I'm just gonna keep doing my show and make jokes about him and I'm not going anywhere [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  Everyone else is getting you know out of their mind [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=257.68s)]
*  Oh, he's gonna he's gonna send the military out to get us and take us off the air [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=260.96s)]
*  No, he's not and if he tried I'd be the first to defend them [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=264.76s)]
*  Anyway, Newt Gingrich say Sean Hannity here [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcPDMmX7iHw&t=269.16s)]
