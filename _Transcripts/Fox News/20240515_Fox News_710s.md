# Sean Hannity: Biden releases his demands to debate Trump
**Fox News:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=0.0s)]
*  Wow, what a news night. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=2.96s)]
*  Panic is in the air. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=4.2s)]
*  Biden's poll numbers have never been lower, and prices, well, sadly, they continue to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=5.36s)]
*  rise, backbreaking inflation, up 20 percent under Joe Biden and this administration, crushing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=10.16s)]
*  you and your families. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=17.64s)]
*  Now America's base is, Biden's base is crumbling. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=19.64s)]
*  Americans are suffering. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=22.76s)]
*  And you see that African Americans, Hispanic Americans, younger voters, part of the Democratic [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=23.96s)]
*  coalition, they're leaving Joe Biden and going right to Donald Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=28.2s)]
*  They're desperately needing to make up ground. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, Biden has now officially agreed to debate Donald Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=34.6s)]
*  How convenient. And a heavily edited, kind of cringe-worthy video posted to social media. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=38.72s)]
*  Oh, Biden put on a brave face and he did his very, very best, tough guy, Dirty Harry [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  impersonation. Never thought I'd see it this bad. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=49.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=53.24s)]
*  Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=54.68s)]
*  Since then, he hadn't shown up for debate. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=59.0s)]
*  Well, make my day, pal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=61.36s)]
*  I'll even do it twice. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=63.08s)]
*  So let's pick the dates, Donald. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=64.88s)]
*  I hear you're free on Wednesdays. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=66.52s)]
*  Well, I just made my day. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=69.44s)]
*  Donald Trump has already agreed to three debates today and he wants to do more. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=71.24s)]
*  Well, not only we can double make your day, Joe, why stop it, too? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=75.8s)]
*  Historically, by the way, it's always been three debates, presidential debates, with the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=79.8s)]
*  exception 2020. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=83.88s)]
*  Why? Because of COVID. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  So Joe, Mr. Make My Day Tough Guy, why not the usual three? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=87.56s)]
*  Or how about four? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=92.92s)]
*  Or how about one a month until the election? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=94.32s)]
*  You might have noticed, by the way, there were five separate edits in that 13 second [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=96.96s)]
*  video. I don't know, did Joe need assistance every 2.6 seconds? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=101.24s)]
*  One can wonder. On X, one user compared the video, this is funny, to a claymation [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=105.8s)]
*  film. Another said that the jump cuts could cause a seizure. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  Wow. And as for Biden's generous offer to participate in two debates. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=117.92s)]
*  Oh, it came with a ton of conditions. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=123.12s)]
*  None of them mentioned during his 13 second Dirty Harry Tough Guy routine. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=126.04s)]
*  Let's be clear. Joe Biden and the media mob, they don't get to collude and dictate [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=131.88s)]
*  all the terms of the debates. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  But that won't stop Joe and the mob from trying. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=140.16000000000003s)]
*  Now, first, well, Mr. Make My Day Joe is demanding no audience. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=143.28s)]
*  Apparently, Joe gets easily scared and likely gets disoriented from crowd noise, which [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=148.8s)]
*  would be new to him since he never gets a large crowd at any of his events, his short [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  events. Now, two, Biden wants third party candidates and independents banned from the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  stage, including R.F.K. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=165.32s)]
*  Jr. Well, as of now, in order to debate third party candidates, they need to be polling [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=167.12s)]
*  at 15 percent, qualify in enough states to get the electoral college votes that are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  needed. But that should be negotiable. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  Three, Joe wants mics to be muted after the allotted speaking time expires. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=179.2s)]
*  So no back and forth. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=185.44s)]
*  I guess it's just too confusing for Joe to keep track. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=187.32s)]
*  Now, I would add that moderators mics, they need to be muted also after a question. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  Why? Because it's obvious the liberal media, they'd love to be two on one versus Donald [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  Trump. No, that can't happen. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  Nor should networks be allowed to put anything on the screen but the names of the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=205.92s)]
*  candidates, because they might try to hurt Donald Trump that way and participate that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=210.48s)]
*  way. No go. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=215.32s)]
*  And while we're at it, there should be no notes, no teleprompters, Joe. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  In other words, Joe, you don't get giant cheat sheets telling you where to stand and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=222.12s)]
*  how to say hello and how to say goodbye. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=229.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden's fourth demand is that he's only willing to debate on certain only [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  four liberal Biden friendly news outlets. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=240.0s)]
*  His choice, ABC, CBS, Telemundo and fake news CNN. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  In response, well, Trump told Fox News this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=249.27999999999997s)]
*  I'm ready to go. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  The dates they proposed are fine anywhere, anytime, anyplace. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=253.92s)]
*  Let's see if Joe can make it to the standup podium. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=258.32s)]
*  And Trump even agreed to hold the first debate on fake news CNN, a network filled with [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=262.56s)]
*  dishonest left wing hacks. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=267.92s)]
*  We know who hate them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=269.36s)]
*  Now, this includes Dana Bash and fake Jake Tapper, who are now tasked, they say, with [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=270.76s)]
*  moderating the debate. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=277.76s)]
*  Let me stop right here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=279.96s)]
*  I'm sorry, but the media mob and Joe Biden, they, I'll say it again, they don't get to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=281.52s)]
*  collude and choose radical Biden supporting hosts in the moderator's chair. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  Nice try, though. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=294.44s)]
*  That means no fake Jake Tapper. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=295.88s)]
*  Tapper is a radical left wing partisan talk show host that masks arrayed as a journalist. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=299.52s)]
*  Now, fake Jake, let's look at his career. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=306.04s)]
*  It started as the press secretary for a Pennsylvania Democrat. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=308.2s)]
*  Then he worked for a DC public relations firm and a gun control group named Handgun [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=312.08s)]
*  Control, Inc. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=318.6s)]
*  Tapper even had a stint at the radical far left publication Salon.com. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=319.92s)]
*  Before eventually making his way to fake news CNN, where all of a sudden now he wants to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  be called and considered a journalist. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  Make no mistake, fake Jake Tapper might be a lot of things. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=333.56s)]
*  He's no journalist. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=337.76000000000005s)]
*  And like everyone else in the media mob, Tapper spent the last several years obsessively [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  hating all things Donald Trump, even retweeting a comment from a notorious Trump hater, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  calling Trump, quote, a hundred percent insane. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  Tapper said the tweet is noteworthy, but that's not all. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=354.28s)]
*  You decide. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=358.08s)]
*  As we watch Donald Trump attempt to turn his arrest and indictment into some sort of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=359.64s)]
*  campaign commercial, the folks in the control room, I don't need to see any more of that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=365.88s)]
*  He's trying to turn this and he's trying to turn it into a spectacle, into a campaign ad. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=370.32s)]
*  That's enough of that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=374.88s)]
*  We've seen it already. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=375.84s)]
*  Here he is right now under under my voice. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=376.88s)]
*  You hear him repeating his anti-immigrant rhetoric. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  President Trump now in quarantine has become a symbol of his own failures. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=383.36s)]
*  He is running the single most negative sleazy campaign in American history for a major [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=390.12s)]
*  party candidate. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=397.8s)]
*  If you were to open up a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf, you would find the Nazi leader [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=398.52s)]
*  describing the mixing of non-Germans with Germans as poisoning. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=403.88s)]
*  There's really no other way to say it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=409.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's language mirrors this directly. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=410.96s)]
*  He pushes the government of the United States to use its power and credibility to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=414.32s)]
*  justify his lies. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=418.88s)]
*  Does that sound like a journalist or a talk show host with very liberal leanings? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=421.68s)]
*  To be clear, Joe Biden will already be debating in friendly territory with moderators who [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  want him to win. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=433.32s)]
*  Fake Jake is disqualified. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, the media mob, the Biden campaign alone do not get to collude and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=437.56s)]
*  decide if Donald Trump is willing to go on a liberal network, then everyone must agree [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=444.68s)]
*  on who moderates. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=451.48s)]
*  Not much more, you know, to choose from there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=453.0s)]
*  But they'll find somebody. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=455.8s)]
*  Maybe Dan and Bash will be all right. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=457.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=459.32s)]
*  Otherwise, Joe will lie with impunity. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=460.52s)]
*  And while Trump will be forced to debate Biden and the liberal talk show host at CNN, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=463.12s)]
*  stop, take that off the air. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=467.88000000000005s)]
*  He's lying. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=470.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=471.36s)]
*  But that's the person you want to moderate. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=472.48s)]
*  Biden's list of demands will also be in effect. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=474.76000000000005s)]
*  And I have no doubt that Jack Dub Joe will probably return to the stage after a heavy [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=478.24s)]
*  dose of, oh, caffeine, Red Bull or whatever he took before the State of the Union. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=483.36s)]
*  That was weird. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  Don't expect a walk in the park. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=490.8s)]
*  Anyway, by Biden, the media mob, excluding Trump from any input is beyond unfair. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=493.68s)]
*  It is beyond insulting. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  They know that Trump and his team won't just bow at their altar and agree to only one [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=502.03999999999996s)]
*  sided terms negotiated likely in secret beforehand. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=508.0s)]
*  Joe, you know, even announced this thing. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=512.24s)]
*  They probably were all discussing it, knowing that, oh, well, we just agree he'll have to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=514.36s)]
*  do what we say. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=518.96s)]
*  It's going to be Joe's way or the highway. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=520.48s)]
*  What he's really trying to do here is ultimately maybe he's really cowering away from [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  any real debate. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=527.44s)]
*  Either take my chosen liberal network with my chosen moderator with all my rules or I'm [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=528.96s)]
*  not going to debate secretly, hoping that Donald Trump insists on basic fairness so [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=534.84s)]
*  they can duck and dodge and cower and hide and say, see, we tried to debate. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=540.44s)]
*  Well, let's see, the American people, they deserve a fair debate. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  They deserve three fair debates at least. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  Maybe Joe Biden just isn't up to a fair debate. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=554.5200000000001s)]
*  Just this morning, he tripped again as he barely shuffled onto the stage in front of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  the Capitol. This after last night's disastrous exit after a speech. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=562.88s)]
*  And earlier this week, he seemingly needed directions how to get back to the White House [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=567.72s)]
*  after a short speech outside. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=572.32s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat, is begging Biden, don't debate Trump. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=574.48s)]
*  He doesn't have a choice. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=578.6s)]
*  Look at your screen. Latest poll, New York Times, Trump up by 12, Nevada. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=580.16s)]
*  He didn't win Nevada in 2016 or 2020. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=585.56s)]
*  Up by 10 in Georgia, 7 Michigan, 7 Arizona, 3 in Pennsylvania. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=588.64s)]
*  If that holds, it is game over for Biden. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=593.88s)]
*  And according to prominent Democratic strategist James Carville, I've debated him. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=596.6s)]
*  I actually like him. I don't agree with the thing he says. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=600.8s)]
*  Joe Biden's in big trouble. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=603.84s)]
*  Everything they're throwing at Trump ain't working. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=605.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=607.24s)]
*  It trumps more head than he's ever been. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=608.7600000000001s)]
*  It's going the wrong way. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=613.6400000000001s)]
*  It's not working. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=615.32s)]
*  Everything that we're throwing is spaghetti at a wall and none of it is sticking. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=617.84s)]
*  Me included. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=624.5200000000001s)]
*  So far, none of the chief political ploys have worked. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=627.32s)]
*  Not the identity politics, not the fear mongering, not the lying about the economy or the border. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=629.9599999999999s)]
*  The less sloppy lawfare campaign is actually making Trump more popular. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=635.3599999999999s)]
*  And you can forget about Biden's policies and proving his poll numbers. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=639.88s)]
*  They have been an unmitigated disaster. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=643.8s)]
*  So now these debates are almost like a Hail Mary for the Biden campaign, which is a pretty tough pill to swallow for the White House press secretary, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=646.28s)]
*  Karine Jean-Pierre. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=655.04s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=656.52s)]
*  So should we see this sudden offer from the president to debate as a signal that you guys realize you need to change the subject after some really bad polling? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=657.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, we went to had a back and forth on polling yesterday. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=668.4s)]
*  I just don't want to get into polling any more details on polling. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=671.52s)]
*  As it relates to the debate, you've got to talk to the campaign about it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=675.3199999999999s)]
*  That is a question for the campaign. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=678.92s)]
*  And I'm sure they are eager, eager to answer your questions, Peter. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=680.7199999999999s)]
*  Democrats, Biden are desperate, but this race is far from over. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=684.48s)]
*  173 days away. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  There's nothing the left won't do to win an election. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=690.6s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=693.24s)]
*  They'll even trot out Joe Biden to a debate stage. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUArVM1cQc&t=694.24s)]
