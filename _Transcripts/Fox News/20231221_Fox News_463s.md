# Democratic Alderman invites Biden, Harris to witness border crisis impact in Chicago
**Fox News:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM)
*  Remember when the media and the Democrats exploded at what they referred to as kids [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=0.0s)]
*  in cages at the southern border under Trump? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=4.8s)]
*  Turns out those were Obama and Biden's cages. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=8.16s)]
*  But now, migrant children are literally dying because of Biden's border crisis, and no [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=11.16s)]
*  one on the left seems to care. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=16.4s)]
*  A five-year-old boy just died after becoming sick at an overcrowded migrant shelter in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=19.28s)]
*  Chicago. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=24.96s)]
*  But according to far-left Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, 1,100 [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=26.88s)]
*  miles away, is to blame. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=33.28s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=36.24s)]
*  The issue is not just how we respond in the city of Chicago. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=37.24s)]
*  It's the fact that we have a governor, a governor, an elected official in the state [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=41.72s)]
*  that is placing families on buses without shoes, cold, wet, tired, hungry, afraid, traumatized, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=49.52s)]
*  and then they come to the city of Chicago where we have homelessness, we have mental [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=58.52s)]
*  health clinics that have been shut down and closed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=62.84s)]
*  You have people who are seeking employment. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=66.34s)]
*  The governor of Texas needs to take a look in the mirror of the chaos that he is causing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  for this country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  This is not just a Chicago dynamic. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  He is attacking our country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt and Chicago alderman and Democratic [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  congressional candidate Raymond Lopez. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=92.72s)]
*  Alderman Lopez, let's start with you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=96.48s)]
*  You seem to be one of the more bolder Democrats taking on your party on what is clearly chaos [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  and crisis all around us. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  But how do you feel listening to the fairly new mayor of Chicago blame the governor of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=105.4s)]
*  Texas for something that tragically happened to a five-year-old boy right there in your [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=110.56s)]
*  city? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  We've walked down this path before, Kellyanne, when we saw Lori Lightfoot try to blame the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  governor for the failure to protect and secure the border of the United States. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=119.72s)]
*  My mayor is blaming everyone except the person who needs to get the blame, and that is President [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=125.4s)]
*  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who are responsible for protecting and securing our borders and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=129.6s)]
*  for having a functional immigration system. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=134.68s)]
*  They're not calling out Secretary Mayorkas for letting undocumented, for letting asylum [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=136.88s)]
*  seekers come to this country under false pretense and then giving them court cases ten years [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=141.6s)]
*  from now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=145.68s)]
*  They're calling on the governor, who's clearly frustrated, who even has Democratic city mayors [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=146.68s)]
*  begging for help as they are being overrun on a daily basis. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  It's outrageous that common sense is nowhere to be found in the Democratic Party anymore [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=155.16s)]
*  when it comes to this issue. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  If we want this to stop, we have to secure the border, we have to stop the draw, which [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=162.42s)]
*  is all the free benefits that people are hearing about and posting about and sharing amongst [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=165.7s)]
*  their social media circles, encouraging the ever-growing flow of individuals, not just [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=169.66s)]
*  from South America now, but from the entire world to come to our southern border, sneak [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=174.06s)]
*  in just so they could get their payment, get their selfie, and then continue the cycle [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=178.54s)]
*  over and over again. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=182.77999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's very well said, Alderman, and thank you very much for being here and sharing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=183.77999999999997s)]
*  those sentiments. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=187.6s)]
*  It really hurtâ€”we all know that the DHS secretary under President Obama, Jay Johnson, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=188.6s)]
*  famously said that 1,000 illegal crossings a day would be a lot, that he, quote, couldn't [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=193.6s)]
*  imagine 4,000. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=198.84s)]
*  Now we have tripled that number in 12,000. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=199.84s)]
*  We don't need to imagine it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=202.88s)]
*  It's right there in front of us. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=204.04s)]
*  Fox News shows the footage constantly. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=205.12s)]
*  But in terms of those who are crossing, we keep seeing these statistics that there could [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=207.76s)]
*  be people on the terror watch list, we know not everyone who comes over has a credible [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=212.88s)]
*  claim of asylum. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=217.36s)]
*  Most don't. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=218.36s)]
*  I think the Alderman made that clear. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=219.36s)]
*  Do you think that we're starting to see more Democrats do what Alderman Lopez is doing? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  You have John Fetterman saying it's a problem. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=226.12s)]
*  Katie Hobbs in Arizona is pushing back on Joe Biden. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  You're starting to see that wall of shame and blamelessness crack? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=231.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=235.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=236.4s)]
*  No, I think we are, and I think that it's most interesting to see people like Katie [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=237.4s)]
*  Hobbs switch their position on this, and I'm hoping that other Democrat politicians do, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=241.52s)]
*  because they're sort of catching up with what normal Democrat voters already believe. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=247.2s)]
*  And this is obviously something that, as you know better than anybody, Donald Trump tapped [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  into in 2016. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=256.36s)]
*  This is not just an issue that Republicans or conservatives care about. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=258.02s)]
*  This is an issue that regular Democrat voters care very much about all across the political [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=261.82s)]
*  spectrum. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  It's just that Democrat leaders have been so off the mark, have been so out to lunch [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  on all of this and forcing these bad policies on the country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=276.18s)]
*  They've been ignoring their own voters. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=280.9s)]
*  And only now that it's gotten this bad do you start seeing that wall crack and you start [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=283.38s)]
*  seeing Democrats calling out these people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  But the Biden administration continues to lie about this every day and claim that the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=291.18s)]
*  border is secure, even as they're flying hundreds and thousands of migrants all over the country [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=295.58s)]
*  on charter planes, and not just charter planes, but if you get on a Delta flight today, the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=302.34s)]
*  chances of you flying somewhere that the government, the Biden administration is also flying a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=308.26s)]
*  bunch of migrants as you're trying to pay for Christmas and things like this, you're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=313.29999999999995s)]
*  also paying for this person to fly all over the country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  This is going on, but obviously the whole world knows it because that's where all these [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=320.82s)]
*  people are coming from. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=324.94s)]
*  Everyone has gotten the message and is pouring over our open border that's been purposefully [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=326.46s)]
*  opened by Joe Biden. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=332.73999999999995s)]
*  Now it's true. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=334.38s)]
*  And Charlie, before I go back to the Alderman to close us out, I just very quickly point [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=335.38s)]
*  out that when Donald Trump first raised this issue in 2015, illegal immigration was 3-4% [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=339.02s)]
*  of the polls. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  Now it is like a top five, top three issue in some polls. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  And I think that you're right, a lot of independents care about this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=348.85999999999996s)]
*  Alderman Lopez, what would happen if you invited Democrats to join you at the border to see [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=351.97999999999996s)]
*  firsthand? You had people like AOC, Kamala Harris, others at the border when Donald Trump [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=355.74s)]
*  was there. They can't seem to find their way back there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  What would happen if you actually led a delegation of Democrats to the border? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  Who would show up? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=364.94s)]
*  You know, I think there would be a small handful of individuals who have common sense that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  would want to see firsthand what's going on, seeing what you guys have reported day in [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=370.94000000000005s)]
*  and day out as the wave of thousands of individuals show up. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=374.38s)]
*  But I've invited Kamala Harris, I've invited Joe Biden, don't want to go to the border, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=377.74s)]
*  then come to one of the encampments that we have, like the one where the five-year-old [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=381.82000000000005s)]
*  passed away the other day. See what your border crisis is doing to our backyard here in the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=385.09999999999997s)]
*  city of Chicago, where we have tens of thousands of individuals crammed together. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=389.82s)]
*  Their failure is something we cannot ignore anymore. We cannot just go with the narrative [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=394.53999999999996s)]
*  and say everything's fine, because there are plenty of individuals who want to see the front [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=399.02s)]
*  door fixed to this country and not have workarounds like this to let people come into this country [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=403.58s)]
*  under false pretense. And additionally, as someone who happens to be of Mexican descent, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  all my Mexican undocumented immigrants in my ward, in my city, are looking at the situation [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=414.53999999999996s)]
*  saying, wait a minute, we came here, we pursued the American dream, we were honest about why we [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=420.46s)]
*  were here for work, to try to get our own share, and now we're being leapfrogged by these individuals [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=425.34s)]
*  who lie to get into this country. I think there's going to be a lot of animosity in the Democratic [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=430.38s)]
*  core if they continue down this path and start alienating all of their true constituents. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  Yes, a tragedy for the five-year-old, but he's not alone. We have a record number of migrant [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=439.65999999999997s)]
*  deaths through these crossings. Mainstream media won't cover it. Democrats completely ignore it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=443.42s)]
*  Alderman Lopez, Charlie Hurt, thank you so much. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOOp5khWtM&t=448.06s)]
