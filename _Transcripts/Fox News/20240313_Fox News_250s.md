# Jim Jordan: Biden willfully violated the law because he was writing a book
**Fox News:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew)
*  Anyway, here now with reaction is the House Judiciary Committee Chairman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=0.0s)]
*  He was leading the proceedings earlier today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=4.72s)]
*  Jim Jordan is with us, sir. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=6.8s)]
*  Robert Herr testified that Biden willfully retained classified documents. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=8.76s)]
*  He further went into detail about how, oh, I just found more classified documents in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  the basement. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=18.92s)]
*  Goes, gets them and reads them to the ghostwriter. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=19.92s)]
*  Did that guy have a security clearance, Mr. Chairman? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=24.04s)]
*  No, he did not, Sean, and you're exactly right. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=26.72s)]
*  He retained classified documents. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=29.86s)]
*  He disclosed the classified documents to an individual who did not have a security clearance, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=31.7s)]
*  but he did have part of the contract for the $8 million to be the ghostwriter for Joe Biden's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=36.94s)]
*  book. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=41.7s)]
*  You know, you always go to motive when there's unlawful activity. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=42.7s)]
*  What was the motive? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=45.3s)]
*  And special counsel Herr was clear. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=46.5s)]
*  The motive was the book. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  He had strong motivations to ignore. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=50.34s)]
*  These are the words of the special counsel to ignore the procedures associated with classified [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=52.94s)]
*  documents because he was writing a book for which he got an $8 million advance. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=57.02s)]
*  So that was the motive. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  And here's the kicker. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=64.94s)]
*  Joe Biden knew the rules. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=66.06s)]
*  He'd been in office now 50 years. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=67.9s)]
*  He chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=69.62s)]
*  He got daily intelligence briefings for eight years as vice president of the United States. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=71.64s)]
*  He had been in the situation room hearing all kinds of classified information. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=77.08s)]
*  He knew the law. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=80.86s)]
*  He knew the rules, but he willfully, knowingly violated those because he was writing a book. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=81.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=88.62s)]
*  So you have a situation here where Joe Biden had eight million reasons to do this, that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=90.1s)]
*  he willfully retained classified documents. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=96.3s)]
*  And what I'm hearing from Robert Herr is that he is incompetent to stand trial. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=99.38s)]
*  And after all, the jury would probably see him as a nice forgetful old man that doesn't [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=104.58s)]
*  know what day of the week it is, but he's going to run for president. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=109.26s)]
*  How do you juxtapose that? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  I don't know how you do it, but you're exactly right. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden's conduct met all the elements of the crime, but because he's a forgetful old [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=117.98s)]
*  man, we're not going to bring charges and we'll just go from there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=126.5s)]
*  Here's the other thing I think is so important. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=127.58000000000001s)]
*  You hit on this, Sean, in your monologue. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=128.96s)]
*  This is so important. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=131.08s)]
*  There have only been three people really run for president in the last three cycles. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=132.08s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, President Biden, President Trump. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=135.26s)]
*  All three were accused of mishandling classified documents, but only one is getting prosecuted [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=138.34s)]
*  by Jack Smith, this guy who's been on an agenda to go after President Trump and went after [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=143.54000000000002s)]
*  Republicans before he went after President Trump. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  So that is the thing I think that stands out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=151.58s)]
*  This double standard that so many Americans see that is wrong because it's supposed to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  be equal treatment under the law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=158.94s)]
*  Hillary Clinton can take a hammer to documents and use bleach bit. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden can can give classified information to the guy who's writing his book and nothing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=163.78s)]
*  happens there, but they go after President Trump makes no sense because it's wrong. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=168.54s)]
*  He testified that Biden's ghostwriter destroyed the evidence when he was named special counsel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=175.06s)]
*  They were able to recover a lot of that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=181.86s)]
*  Maybe all of it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=183.7s)]
*  I didn't get the full picture on that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=184.7s)]
*  Yeah, they recovered it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=186.58s)]
*  But the fact that he destroyed it, if that's not obstruction and you're right, Sean, he [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=188.12s)]
*  did it after Robert Her is named special counsel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=192.14s)]
*  So it's like, oh, Shazam, there's a special counsel. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=195.66s)]
*  I'm going to delete this stuff. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to get rid of it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=199.9s)]
*  Nothing happens to him. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=201.62s)]
*  But go to the Trump situation. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=202.78s)]
*  Some guy moves some boxes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=204.5s)]
*  This is alleged. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=206.06s)]
*  It's not proven. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=207.06s)]
*  Somebody moves some boxes and he gets charged with President Trump. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=208.06s)]
*  What's again, a different standard. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=211.5s)]
*  And that is again, that is what is so wrong with this and what's so frustrating, I think, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=213.98s)]
*  to the American people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=218.34s)]
*  Well, how could they be? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=219.9s)]
*  I mean, if the guy is, you know, he's not capable to stand trial, if he's incompetent [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=222.46s)]
*  to stand trial, we'll just charge the guy that is competent. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=227.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=231.3s)]
*  What a great justice system. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HZRPa-xew&t=232.3s)]
