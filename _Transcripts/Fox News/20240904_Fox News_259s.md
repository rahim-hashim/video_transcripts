# Newt Gingrich: Kamala Harris is beginning to ‘crumble’
**Fox News:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4)
*  Joining us now, Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Kingrich, is with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=0.0s)]
*  us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=3.96s)]
*  Let's get your take about where we are, two weeks from today, early voting in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=4.96s)]
*  Mail-in ballots go out North Carolina elsewhere in just the next couple of days. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=10.72s)]
*  It's game time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=16.28s)]
*  Yeah, my guess is that she's beginning to crumble and that waltz is a significant part [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=18.92s)]
*  of that crumbling. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=27.72s)]
*  My guess is that Trump is beginning to find his stride and will be in pretty good shape [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  in the next two or three weeks. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=35.8s)]
*  The challenge for Harris is that nobody actually knows a lot about her. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=38.44s)]
*  And so, as you fill in the gaps, people begin to realize both how radical she is, but also [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=42.76s)]
*  how totally unready she is. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=50.68s)]
*  I mean, you imagine her negotiating with Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=53.04s)]
*  You imagine her in the room with Xi Jinping or dealing with other figures around the world. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=57.56s)]
*  She's just not ready. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=63.88s)]
*  And you look at waltz, waltz is worse. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=65.92s)]
*  He may be the most dishonest vice presidential candidate in history, and I think he'll [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=68.32s)]
*  end up being the worst since Tom Eagleton had to resign from the ticket way back in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=74.48s)]
*  1972. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=79.76s)]
*  So, he's just a disaster. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  And day by day, we learn more about how weird he is and how often he lies and how strongly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  the people around him resented the fact that he lied. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=91.04s)]
*  So, I feel personally that Trump is in a good space to keep focusing on the issues, to keep [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  drawing the contrast and to remind people that a tax-increasing, left-wing Democrat [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=102.48s)]
*  taking money out of your pocket is not nearly as good as an entrepreneur who wants to put [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=108.92s)]
*  money in your pocket. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=114.72s)]
*  And that's the biggest single gap between Trump and Harris. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=116.56s)]
*  The only thing that I do worry about is that people don't know how radical she is. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=122.16s)]
*  And I've been asking you that question. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=127.92s)]
*  Do you feel like it's beginning to seep into the consciousness of American voters? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=129.84s)]
*  Now, we have new polls out tonight that show Donald Trump up in most swing states, and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=134.84s)]
*  we'll get to that with our pollsters later in the program. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=139.88s)]
*  Do you think it's beginning to seep into people's minds? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  What? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's— [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  Why are you laughing at my question? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  Look, we're in a very dynamic environment. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  This is not a Polaroid snapshot. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=155.76s)]
*  I believe that she peaked the night of her acceptance speech. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=159.16s)]
*  And if you remember, Michael Dukakis peaked at 17 points ahead. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=164.28s)]
*  She was probably at best two or three points ahead. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=169.08s)]
*  And that was her momentum. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=172.56s)]
*  And she's been losing ground ever since. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=174.28s)]
*  They're not going to Virginia, New Hampshire and Minnesota for fun. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=176.16s)]
*  They're going because they're beginning to see the margin of their own states crumble. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  They're seeing all three of those states move into contention. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=186.0s)]
*  I think New Mexico will be next, because the oil and gas industry is so big down there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, and I think—you just go place by place. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=194.92s)]
*  I'm certain, as somebody born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with relatives who still live [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  in the middle of the state, they're going to lose Pennsylvania, period. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=203.0s)]
*  She could have picked the governor of Pennsylvania, Shapiro. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=207.56s)]
*  That might have helped her. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  But when you have an anti-fracking candidate in a state which has literally two of the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=211.76s)]
*  four largest natural gas fields in the entire world are in Western Pennsylvania, billions [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=217.32s)]
*  and billions of dollars of economic opportunity, I just think Trump will carry Pennsylvania [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=225.44s)]
*  and win the election. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=232.52s)]
*  And even fake news. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=234.52s)]
*  CNN had to fact-check her lie that, well, in the debate in 2020, I said that I'm for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=235.52s)]
*  She never said it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=241.32s)]
*  That was a lie, too. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=242.8s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, thank you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=245.32s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFK5z74ipw4&t=246.4s)]
