# Hannity: Biden now blames Trump for border crisis
**Fox News:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4)
*  Now, as we warned you last night, the disastrous border bill is nothing more than a blatant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=0.0s)]
*  attempt by Biden and the left. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=4.8s)]
*  They just want to shift the blame for his border crisis squarely under the shoulders [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  of Republicans. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  This is his and his alone. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=14.02s)]
*  And speaking at the White House today, Joe tried to do just that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=16.04s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=19.76s)]
*  So, I'm calling on Congress to pass this bill. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=20.76s)]
*  Get it to my desk immediately. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  But if the bill fails, I want to be absolutely clear about something. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  The American people are going to know why it failed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=29.52s)]
*  I'll be taking this issue to the country. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=32.76s)]
*  And the voters are going to know that it's not just a moment. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=34.92s)]
*  Just at the moment, we're going to secure the border and fund these other programs. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=38.68s)]
*  Trump and the Magna Republicans said no because they're afraid of Donald Trump. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Afraid of Donald Trump. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=50.72s)]
*  Every day between now and November, the American people are going to know that the only reason [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=52.92s)]
*  the border is not secure is Donald Trump and his Magna Republican friends. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=57.44s)]
*  That is a big lie. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=63.72s)]
*  We'll break it down in a second. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=64.72s)]
*  Now, echoing Biden's remarks, his press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, added this at today's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=66.0s)]
*  White House briefing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=71.64s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=72.64s)]
*  So, I mean, they voted. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=73.64s)]
*  They've actually voted. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=74.64s)]
*  The Democrats have been in control for the first two years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=75.64s)]
*  No responsibility. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=76.64s)]
*  It has. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=77.64s)]
*  I'm not saying that Democrats have not been in control the first two years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=78.64s)]
*  That's not what I'm saying. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm saying House Republicans have got in the way. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  They have. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=86.16s)]
*  They have purposefully gotten in the way in trying to fix what's happening at the border. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=87.88s)]
*  Oh, so now it's all the Republicans' fault that Joe Biden's wide-open border with 10 [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=91.88s)]
*  million unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=98.12s)]
*  He has no responsibility in that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=100.52s)]
*  I thought they kept telling us, though, that the border is closed and the border is secure, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=103.32s)]
*  like Democrats have been telling us this for three years. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=109.0s)]
*  In case you might have forgotten, I'll remind you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=112.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  Sounds to most folks like a crisis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=116.2s)]
*  Well, look, it's way down now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=118.2s)]
*  We've now gotten control. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=120.7s)]
*  Precisely that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=122.5s)]
*  The border is closed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=123.5s)]
*  Nor could I have been clearer and continue to be so, which is the border is closed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=125.06s)]
*  The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=131.62s)]
*  The border, we are working to make the border more secure. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=137.3s)]
*  You're confident this border's secure? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=141.78s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=145.42s)]
*  our administration. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=153.42s)]
*  We agree that the border is secure. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, they've peddled that lie for three years. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=157.14s)]
*  We all know the truth. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=159.94s)]
*  They're lying to us. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=160.94s)]
*  That has not stopped the media mob, of course, from backing Biden and all those attempts [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=162.44s)]
*  to blame Republicans. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  They're now joining on board. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=168.27999999999997s)]
*  They take their talking points seriously. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=171.45999999999998s)]
*  You have one of the flimmest majorities in the House in history. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=172.74s)]
*  Don't you have to compromise to get something done? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=177.18s)]
*  What you passed in the House can't pass in the Senate, Mr. Speaker. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=179.58s)]
*  You know that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=183.78s)]
*  This is almost entirely a border security bill, and its provisions include long-time [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=184.78s)]
*  GOP priorities that the party restrictionists could never have passed only a few months [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  ago. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=200.86s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  You're listening, Mikey. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  Just because Donald tells you to jump doesn't mean that you have to put America's security [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  at risk. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=210.5s)]
*  Last night, a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a compromise bill, but the Republican [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=211.5s)]
*  speaker of the House says it's dead on arrival. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=216.28s)]
*  But the border, I mean, we're looking every day at the invasion of migrants, and they're [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=218.84s)]
*  playing a time game with politics on this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  Couldn't that pressure put to bear in their home states? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=227.3s)]
*  Dead on arrival, the speaker of the House vowing to tank the historic border deal reached [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=230.54s)]
*  by both parties in the Senate. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=235.42s)]
*  And on defense over accusations, it's Donald Trump pulling the strings. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=237.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=242.54s)]
*  Let me educate Joe Biden and all his willing accomplices of liars that I call the media [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=244.82s)]
*  mob. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=250.94s)]
*  Congress is not at all, not one bit responsible for this national security nightmare that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=251.94s)]
*  Joe Biden created. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=258.94s)]
*  The media mob, they have been silent. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  They have been complicit now for three years. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=262.58s)]
*  They have allowed the big lie that the border is secure and closed to go forward unchallenged. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  They have not been showing you, the American people on other channels, the disaster that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=270.17999999999995s)]
*  is going on that Joe created at our southern border. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=275.14s)]
*  Biden has, was handed the single most secure border in our nation's history. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=278.7s)]
*  Now, here's what really happened. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=283.02s)]
*  With the stroke of a pen, this is a pen, Joe Biden revoked all of Donald Trump's efforts [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=285.18s)]
*  to exclude illegal immigrants from the census. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  He strengthened DACA. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  He ended Trump's interior enforcement rule. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=295.94s)]
*  He halted all border wall construction. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=298.82s)]
*  He ended asylum agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=302.02s)]
*  He ended the remain in Mexico policy, and he even let Title 42 expire. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=306.5s)]
*  Biden never needed Congress to fix any of this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=311.74s)]
*  He can reinstate all of those policies that he revoked just as he undid them with the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=315.18s)]
*  stroke of a pen. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  But that's not going to stop the mob, the media, the liberal Joes in the media from [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=322.58s)]
*  remaining complicit in the Biden border crisis. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=326.86s)]
*  They have not covered this story for three years. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=330.38s)]
*  They have steadfastly refused to be showing on a regular basis how bad this disaster is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=333.14s)]
*  at our southern border caused by Biden's failed policies. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=338.78s)]
*  And let me be very clear. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=342.46s)]
*  The Senate border bill, they're all pushing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=343.78s)]
*  It's an unmitigated disaster. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=346.42s)]
*  And by the way, the only good news is Mitch McConnell admitted earlier today it's dead. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=347.74s)]
*  And not only would this bill do nothing to secure the border, it could, as written, actually [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  codify all of Biden's aiding and abetting of illegal immigrants and lawbreaking into [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=358.86s)]
*  law. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=364.65999999999997s)]
*  And they know deep down it's total BS. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=365.7s)]
*  In fact, earlier today on my radio show, Senator Rand Paul joined us from Kentucky, said some [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  Republican senators wanted to keep all of the details that they were putting in this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=372.94s)]
*  bill away from people like me, specifically because they knew how bad this legislation [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  is for conservatives. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=384.58s)]
*  And basically, it's not me. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=386.17999999999995s)]
*  They didn't want you to hear about it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=387.82s)]
*  And by the way, this is what he said to me. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=389.94s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  I'll tell you what I do here behind the scenes is, is I hear from people in our caucus who [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=393.66s)]
*  talk to sources high up who say, we need to make sure Sean Hannity's not talking about [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=398.38000000000005s)]
*  this to Laura Ingraham, because conservatives, that's why they kept it secret. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=403.1s)]
*  And that was said out loud in our caucus that said, this has to be kept, and it cannot be [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=407.02000000000004s)]
*  allowed to go in front of the conservative talk show host. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=413.38s)]
*  It cannot be allowed to discuss. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=415.66s)]
*  That's why it's secret. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=417.62s)]
*  How dare we may actually tell the American people, that's all of you, the truth. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=419.38s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, earlier this evening, House Republicans, their effort to impeach the DHS [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=423.14s)]
*  secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, it ended up as a tie, but then one flipped so they can bring this bill back. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=429.41999999999996s)]
*  For example, Steve Scalise was not there today. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=434.62s)]
*  Utah Congressman Blake Moore switched the vote from yes to no, rightly so. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=437.26s)]
*  And by voting for the majority, that means Congressman Moore can reintroduce the legislation [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=442.82s)]
*  at a later date. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=446.9s)]
*  And with Steve Scalise set to return, plus special elections looming in New York District [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=448.94s)]
*  3, by the way, early voting is going on now. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=453.26s)]
*  That'll be a week from Tuesday. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=455.94s)]
*  And then California, we have an election in May. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=457.74s)]
*  Republicans will have a chance to secure a stronger majority. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=460.58000000000004s)]
*  Hopefully they do, and a greater likelihood of passing the impeachment. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSD7rp5Am4&t=463.14000000000004s)]
