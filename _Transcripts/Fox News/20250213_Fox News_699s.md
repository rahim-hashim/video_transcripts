# Sean Hannity: It’s week 4 of shock and awe
**Fox News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g)
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight it is full steam ahead at the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=0.0s)]
*  So far, 16 Trump cabinet nominees have been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=5.48s)]
*  This includes the newly sworn in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert—sorry, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=9.92s)]
*  Robert Kennedy Jr. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=14.72s)]
*  On the heels, of course, of Tulsi Gabbard yesterday, the Make America Healthy Again [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=16.2s)]
*  movement is now an official part of your federal government. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=20.6s)]
*  And by the way, don't worry. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  your polio vaccines will still be available. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=27.14s)]
*  At McDonald's and KFC, they will not be closing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=29.94s)]
*  But the Trump White House, by the way, is making big changes across the federal government. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=33.56s)]
*  The executive branch is no longer on cruise control. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=38.7s)]
*  We actually have a president taking the reins and taking it back from these unelected, self-important, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=42.18s)]
*  far-left, deep state bureaucrats that nobody knows their names from the Washington swamp. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=48.94s)]
*  And a lot of them, bye-bye, they're leaving. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=54.1s)]
*  Of course, this has major implications, both here at home and abroad. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=56.14s)]
*  We're going to analyze Trump's plan for reciprocal tariffs in just a moment. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  Kind of sounds fair, doesn't it? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=64.74000000000001s)]
*  Did you know Canada taxes us? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=65.98s)]
*  Did you know the European Union has high taxes on us? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=67.94s)]
*  Did you know India has high taxes on us and tariffs? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=70.58s)]
*  Why don't we do the same to them, or they stop what they're doing? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=74.30000000000001s)]
*  But that's not the only big news from the White House today. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=78.78s)]
*  President Trump is ready to negotiate peace in Europe and lead a new era of communication, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=81.58s)]
*  accountability and peace, hopefully worldwide. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=86.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=89.66s)]
*  Do you want to have Russia back to the G7, sir? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=90.66s)]
*  I'd love to have them back. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=93.5s)]
*  I think it was a mistake to throw them out. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=94.62s)]
*  Look, it's not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=96.42s)]
*  It was the G8. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=99.1s)]
*  And you know, I said, what are you doing? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=100.9s)]
*  You guys, all you talk about is Russia, and they should be sitting at the table. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=102.58s)]
*  I think Putin would love to be back. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=107.42s)]
*  Obama and a couple of other people made a mistake and they got Russia out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=110.18s)]
*  It's very possible that if that was the G8, you wouldn't have had the problem with Ukraine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=115.26s)]
*  And if I was president, you definitely wouldn't have had the problem with Ukraine. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=119.82s)]
*  Russia would have never attacked Ukraine. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=123.1s)]
*  We were talking about denuking, denuclearized, denuking. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=124.42s)]
*  And President Putin and I agreed that we were going to do it in a very big way. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=128.82s)]
*  There's no reason for us to be building brand new nuclear weapons. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  We already have so many you could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=137.84s)]
*  And here we are building new nuclear weapons and they're building nuclear weapons and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=144.96s)]
*  China's building new nuclear weapons. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  It's week four of Shock It On. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=150.88s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, the war in Europe started under President Joe Biden, frankly, the worst [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=153.84s)]
*  president in modern American history. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=157.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=160.08s)]
*  I think Biden is incompetent. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=161.08s)]
*  And I think when he said that they could join NATO, I thought that was a good thing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=163.12s)]
*  NATO is a very stupid thing to say. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=167.76s)]
*  I thought when he said, well, it depends if it's a minor incursion. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=169.6s)]
*  In other words, it's OK if Russia does a minor incursion. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=173.64s)]
*  I thought that was a very foolish thing to say. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  The other thing that got it started was how badly Milly and these stupid people, bad generals, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  how badly they did with Afghanistan. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=190.2s)]
*  I was going to pull out, but we were pulling out with dignity and strength and we were [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=193.1s)]
*  going to take our equipment with us and everything else. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=197.56s)]
*  They are. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=201.08s)]
*  I mean, what they're doing is what they did with that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=202.08s)]
*  I think Putin looked at that mess and he said, wow, this is a great time. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=205.4s)]
*  I'm going to go and this should have been done by Biden years ago. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=209.28s)]
*  This should have never been allowed to happen. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=212.08s)]
*  I know he's a friend of yours. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=213.8s)]
*  He's a friend of CNN. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=214.8s)]
*  That's why nobody watches CNN anymore, because they have no no credibility. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=215.8s)]
*  The president's right, Joe Biden, he was asleep at the wheel those days, thankfully [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=221.28s)]
*  are over. Peace through strength is back. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=226.32s)]
*  America's newfound strength abroad doesn't just extend to our foes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump is also not afraid to hold our allies accountable, including our neighbor to the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=233.84s)]
*  north. Take a look at this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=238.24s)]
*  So I think Canada is going to be a very serious contender to be our fifty first state. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=240.16s)]
*  There was obviously a delay in implementing those tariffs. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=246.16s)]
*  I spoke to Governor Trudeau on numerous occasions and we'll see what happens. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=253.56s)]
*  But it just sets up so good for them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  Look, the people would pay much less tax than they're paying right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=261.2s)]
*  They'd have perfect military protection. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=264.12s)]
*  They don't have any military protection because they essentially because and you take a look [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=266.44s)]
*  at what's going on out there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=271.8s)]
*  You have Russian ships, you have China ships, you have Chinese ships, you have a lot of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=272.96s)]
*  ships out there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=278.68s)]
*  And, you know, people are in danger. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=279.68s)]
*  It's a different world today. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=281.96s)]
*  It's a different world. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  They need our protection. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=284.32s)]
*  By the way, just stop for a second. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=285.32s)]
*  And it kind of refreshing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=289.32s)]
*  We have a president, not predetermined question. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=290.32s)]
*  Let me go to Joe from Reuters. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  Joe, read the question that we pre-approved. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=298.64s)]
*  I mean, kind of refreshing, extemporaneous, the president giving access to the media. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  You think they'd be grateful, but they're not. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=307.28s)]
*  Canada's leaders, they're going to have to learn that we do have all the leverage. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=310.88s)]
*  They need to stop the tariffs they currently have on American products. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=314.76s)]
*  They need to pay their fair share to NATO. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=318.76s)]
*  They need to secure their borders. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=321.04s)]
*  And Donald Trump is determined to hold hold Canada and all countries to a high standard [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  to restore fairness in our agreements, to put America first. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=329.64s)]
*  Now, that's what these countries are doing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  This isn't just about other countries. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  The president is also holding our very own government accountable. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=337.32s)]
*  Every single department is now facing an intensive review, something that's been long overdue. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=341.4s)]
*  Bad actors, unproductive workers are being shown the door. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  Seventy-five thousand federal employees—I promise you won't miss them—have accepted [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  the president's buyout offer and will no longer be employed and paid for by you, the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=355.44s)]
*  taxpayers, as of October the 1st. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=360.76s)]
*  And just this week, Donald Trump also terminated Biden's climate corps, which planned to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=364.08s)]
*  hire 20,000 climate-obsessed radical leftist communist socialists committed to social justice [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=368.88s)]
*  and anti-racism. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  And at the EPA, the newly sworn in administrator, Lee Zeldin, uncovered a whopping $20 billion [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  slush fund earmarked for left-wing NGOs that Biden staffers tried to hide in a third-party [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=385.56s)]
*  account. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=391.32s)]
*  According to President Trump, the Department of Education will be no more. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=392.36s)]
*  Don't worry, your kids will still get an education. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=396.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=398.96s)]
*  How soon do you want the Department of Education to be closed? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=399.96s)]
*  Oh, I'd like it to be closed immediately. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  Look, the Department of Education is a big con job. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=405.6s)]
*  We're ranked—so they ranked the top 40 countries in the world. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=408.8s)]
*  We're ranked number 40th. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=412.64s)]
*  But we're ranked number one in one department, cost per pupil. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=414.6s)]
*  So we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=418.84s)]
*  But we're ranked number 40. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=422.44s)]
*  Norway, Denmark, Sweden, I hate to say it, China, as big as it is, it's ranked in the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=424.28s)]
*  top five. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's our—that's our primary competitor. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=432.4s)]
*  We're ranked number 40. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=435.35999999999996s)]
*  So if we're ranked number 40, that means something's really wrong, right? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=437.0s)]
*  Well, you could also give the money directly to parents. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  that offers reading, writing, math, history and science and not a woke agenda. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=444.66s)]
*  You can block grant money to states, but you can also have standards that must be met. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=451.62s)]
*  The Department of Education may not be the only bloated government entity that's on [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=455.82000000000005s)]
*  the chopping block. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=459.78000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk, his team at Doge, they are uncovering a massive amount of waste, fraud, abuse and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=461.06s)]
*  corruption. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=466.98s)]
*  They're finding it every day. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=467.98s)]
*  Get this. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=468.98s)]
*  They're finding that the HHS reportedly spent more than $22 billion to buy illegal [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=469.98s)]
*  immigrants cars. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  They're buying cars for illegals and help out with their home loans and their startups. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=476.98s)]
*  And while the Biden administration worked to fast-track the lives of illegals, putting [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=481.98s)]
*  them above all of you, everyone else is forced to navigate a sea of rules and regulations [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=486.58000000000004s)]
*  to get anything done. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  Take a look at this chart. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=493.1s)]
*  law passed in the U.S., bureaucrats in D.C. created over 18 new regulations across the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=495.1s)]
*  government. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=501.5s)]
*  There are nearly 100 million words spelling out each and every regulation. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=502.5s)]
*  That is the definition of insanity. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=508.5s)]
*  That is a bureaucracy that is spun way out of control. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=510.36s)]
*  Until now, almost no one has critically regulated America's all-powerful, ever-growing federal [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=513.7s)]
*  bureaucracy. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=519.98s)]
*  This may be the only opportunity in our lifetime to truly limit the size, the scope, the influence, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=521.06s)]
*  the reach of government in every aspect of your life. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=527.9s)]
*  We need to take advantage of this moment. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=532.42s)]
*  But instead of speaking truth to power, many on the left, they're just desperate to defend [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=534.4799999999999s)]
*  mother government above all else. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=538.7399999999999s)]
*  For example, over at MSDNC, conspiracy theorist Rachel Mattaw stoking the flames of hysteria, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=541.5799999999999s)]
*  peddling another lie, another hoax, and a complete distortion. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=548.5s)]
*  This time, Elon Musk is the target. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=552.74s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=554.9799999999999s)]
*  As the top campaign donor to U.S. President Donald Trump, Elon Musk has apparently somehow [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=555.9799999999999s)]
*  convinced the United States government, specifically the United States Department of State, that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=561.76s)]
*  the taxpayers of the United States of America should spend $400 million buying, quote, armored [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=568.62s)]
*  Tesla production units. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=578.26s)]
*  You got armored Tesla vehicles. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=581.7s)]
*  Donald Trump's corrupting you. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=584.7s)]
*  This is terrible. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=586.14s)]
*  This is a conflict of interest. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=587.14s)]
*  Here are two very critical facts that she omitted in that conspiracy theory. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=588.98s)]
*  Somehow she failed to mention, first, the Tesla procurement plan. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=593.22s)]
*  That started under Joe Biden, Rachel, not Donald Trump. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=599.3s)]
*  Number two, this plan was canceled by President Trump. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=602.54s)]
*  As always, MSDNC, Mattaw lying, deceiving their audience. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=607.46s)]
*  They haven't learned a thing, and they do it for political gain and, frankly, a paycheck. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=611.74s)]
*  And she's not the only left-wing zealot pushing conspiracy theories. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=615.82s)]
*  Delaware Senator Chris Coons put this dramatic post on ex-blaming Musk and Trump for allowing [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=619.54s)]
*  critical medicines to expire in a warehouse. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=625.54s)]
*  They're horrible people, unable to reach Africa because of the USAID, you know, quotes. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=628.34s)]
*  Two problems with that tweet. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=636.26s)]
*  One, as Musk has pointed out, giving shipping routes and distribution times, that medicine [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=637.82s)]
*  needed to be shipped months ago if it was truly about to expire. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=643.5s)]
*  Number two, you kind of zoom in on the box. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=647.5s)]
*  Take a closer look. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=650.5s)]
*  The medicine appears to have an expiration date. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=651.5s)]
*  That date is 2027. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=655.7s)]
*  Loopsie-daisy. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=658.78s)]
*  Anyway, so Trump and Musk do important work. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=659.78s)]
*  Trumps have nothing to offer other than their daily temper tantrums, their screaming, yelling [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=663.62s)]
*  hysteria, their lies, their fear-mongering, their conspiracy theories. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=668.1s)]
*  Soon it will be calls for impeachment. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=671.98s)]
*  They, you know, of course, have been turning to the courts to lend a helping hand. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=674.18s)]
*  And now even that is failing. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=678.5s)]
*  Two courts just ruled in Donald Trump's favor, allowing his federal employee buyout plan [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=680.14s)]
*  to move forward and restoring Trump's ability to freeze federal funding. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o03RuVzi2g&t=684.78s)]
