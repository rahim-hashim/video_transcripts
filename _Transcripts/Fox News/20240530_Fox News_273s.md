# Alina Habba: Hillary Clinton should be sitting on trial, not Trump
**Fox News:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs)
*  All right, today the media mob, their coverage of the Trump trial on MSD&C, well, let's say [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=0.0s)]
*  got very weird, very fast. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=6.98s)]
*  As former Mueller pit bull, remember Andrew Weissman? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=9.42s)]
*  Anyway, he took a moment to declare his deep abiding love for Judge Mershon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=12.34s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=19.18s)]
*  As you've noted with respect to Judge Mershon, I mean, I am like now, you know, I felt like [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=20.64s)]
*  a man crush on him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=25.36s)]
*  He is such a great judge that it's hard to see that the jurors wouldn't have the same [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=27.18s)]
*  impression. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=32.58s)]
*  And he's just, you just keep on thinking if you looked in a dictionary for like judicial [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=33.58s)]
*  temperament, that's what you get. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=37.78s)]
*  He's one of those guys that peddled the Russia conspiracy hoax live for three years on a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=41.1s)]
*  network that peddled conspiracy theories for three years. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=45.94s)]
*  Isn't that sweet? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=49.42s)]
*  And now Trump legal spokeswoman Alina Habe is back with us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=51.1s)]
*  All right, let's get your take on all of this today, Alina. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=54.74s)]
*  Well, Sean, you know, I know intimately the Mueller and Russia hoax, and this is the epitome [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=57.86s)]
*  of it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=65.22s)]
*  He's like an advertisement for Hillary Clinton and the BS that they peddled and they got [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=66.22s)]
*  away with. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  And God knows if it was Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  No chance. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  By the way, that's a perfect example, Sean, of an FEC investigation that actually resulted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  in a fine, unlike President Trump, unlike the hoax that we're dealing with right now [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=81.3s)]
*  in New York. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=85.2s)]
*  He should be ashamed of himself. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=86.22s)]
*  Well, by the way, Alina, let me remind people— [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=87.22s)]
*  I mean, that was just the most ridiculous. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=88.22s)]
*  That's when she took money and funneled it through a law firm that hired an op research [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=91.22s)]
*  firm that hired a guy by the name of Christopher Steele that put together a dirty Russian disinformation [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=98.72s)]
*  lying dossier that was used to get not one but four FISA warrants approved lying to a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=104.66s)]
*  FISA court. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=112.04s)]
*  Nobody seems to pay a price in those cases. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=113.48s)]
*  But most importantly, Sean, what did she do with that money? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  She funneled it through her law firm. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=120.14s)]
*  And the law firm was a guy's. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=123.34s)]
*  Sounds very familiar. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=125.06s)]
*  Don't forget what they're doing here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=127.18s)]
*  Don't forget what trial we're dealing with here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=128.74s)]
*  If they're saying that he's doing it, it's because they've done it themselves. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=131.02s)]
*  President Trump has done nothing wrong. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=134.94s)]
*  Who has done something wrong was exactly the example of what we just saw. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=136.54000000000002s)]
*  This man has a crush on this judge. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=140.86s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  Because he tells the false narrative that the Democrats right now need because President [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=144.42s)]
*  Biden cannot win on policies. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=148.28s)]
*  He cannot win on immigration. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=150.11999999999998s)]
*  He cannot win on anything. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=151.88s)]
*  So they have somebody come up who's from back in the day and fail to acknowledge the fact [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=153.94s)]
*  that Hillary Clinton actually got an FEC violation for funneling money through a law firm for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  booking it as a legal expense. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=163.17999999999998s)]
*  That is the person that should be sitting on trial right now, not President Trump. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  Let me ask you, what was your take and your read on the questions that are being asked [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=171.32s)]
*  by the jury and jury instructions that, as we pointed out, actually go against not one [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=177.2s)]
*  but two separate Supreme Court decisions? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=184.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think that we have to be honest about what's going on here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=187.16s)]
*  For me to sit here and give America false hopes would be disingenuous. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that realistically, this judge is going to manage these questions the way he wants. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=197.88s)]
*  Number one, their questions are about Pecker and Cohen's testimony. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=202.68s)]
*  Personally, I wouldn't even be looking at Cohen's testimony, Sean. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  I can't imagine a world in which I would care what that man said. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=210.72s)]
*  Number two, we've got Pecker's testimony about stories, but all of them are missing one thing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=214.76s)]
*  President Trump, who was in the White House, running what he needed to run. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=221.16s)]
*  So I'm confused by it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=225.4s)]
*  I honestly know better at this point than to assume that a New York jury is doing anything [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=227.12s)]
*  other than looking at it and assuming—you know, I always assume the worst in New York, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=234.60000000000002s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=239.4s)]
*  But hopefully this jury is taking this case seriously. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=240.56s)]
*  To me, it should have been acquittal. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=243.84s)]
*  I know for you the same. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=245.08s)]
*  But we're in New York, and that was by design. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=246.62s)]
*  So let's see what happens. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=249.24s)]
*  We're giving them the evidence they needed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=250.24s)]
*  They will reread the jury instructions tomorrow. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=252.44000000000003s)]
*  I'll be there, and we'll report back on what happens. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=254.56s)]
*  All right, Alina, thank you for the update. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=257.48s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn9SdSPRbSs&t=259.96s)]
