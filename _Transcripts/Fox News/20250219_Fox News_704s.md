# Trump, Musk give a glimpse at how long they'll continue to work together
**Fox News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo)
*  So, people ask me, like, what's the—what's, like, the—what's your biggest surprise [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=0.0s)]
*  in D.C.? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=5.76s)]
*  And I'm like, the sheer scale. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=6.76s)]
*  It's massive. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=8.24s)]
*  So, you would love the challenge. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=9.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, to the president's point— [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=10.24s)]
*  He'll never do anything bigger. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=11.24s)]
*  That's the only thing you can say. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=12.24s)]
*  He'll never do anything— [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=13.24s)]
*  I mean, you do something slightly better, and you save billions of dollars for the American [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=14.24s)]
*  taxpayer. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=19.36s)]
*  Just slightly better. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=20.36s)]
*  When you say— [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=21.36s)]
*  Slightly. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=22.36s)]
*  —tech support. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=23.36s)]
*  You get 1 percent better, and it's like, you know, tens of billions of dollars saved [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=24.36s)]
*  for the American taxpayer. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=26.16s)]
*  If I may address the point that you—the question you asked earlier, which is, you [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=27.52s)]
*  know, how do we assure people that— [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=31.92s)]
*  They want to know. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=33.4s)]
*  Yeah, how do we assure people that we're going to do the right thing, that their social [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=34.4s)]
*  security benefits will be there, that the medical care will be good? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=37.92s)]
*  And, in fact, how do we make it—ensure that there's better medical care in the future? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  How do we improve their benefits? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=47.84s)]
*  How do we make sure that their social security check goes further than it did in the past [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=49.16s)]
*  and not—it doesn't get weakened by inflation? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=52.84s)]
*  So, if we address the massive deficit spending, the sort of—the waste in the government, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=57.36s)]
*  then we can actually address inflation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=66.6s)]
*  So provided the economy grows faster than the money supply, which means you stop the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=69.84s)]
*  government overspending and the waste, and the output of real useful goods and services [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=75.2s)]
*  exceeds the increase in the money supply, you have no inflation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=80.6s)]
*  And you also drop the interest payments that people pay, because if the government— [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=85.12s)]
*  Waves go high. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=89.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=90.12s)]
*  The reason the interest payments are so high is because the national debt keeps increasing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=91.12s)]
*  So the government is competing to sell debt with the private citizens. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=95.56s)]
*  This drives up the interest rate. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=101.6s)]
*  So if you have a—if you cut back on the deficit, you actually have an amazing situation [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=103.46s)]
*  for people because you get rid of inflation and you drop the interest rates. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=110.62s)]
*  And that means people's mortgage payments go down, their credit card payments go down, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  their car payments go down, their student loans go down, everything. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=118.78s)]
*  Their life becomes more affordable, and their standard of living improves. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  How quickly? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  Because I think people are suffering now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  We're still living under the Biden- [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=128.46s)]
*  But, Sean, you have states right now, you have some states that operate that way. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=130.18s)]
*  They operate as well as any corporation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  They really operate well. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=136.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  They have surpluses. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  Texas has a surplus, for example. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  When they look at New York and California and some of these places that should have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=141.7s)]
*  an advantage—I mean, there's a big advantage. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  Or Pritzker does such a bad job in Illinois, it's horrible how bad he is. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  And they don't have that advantage. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=154.33999999999997s)]
*  You know, New York has stock exchange and a lot of things, and California has the weather [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=155.33999999999997s)]
*  and the beautiful water and all the things. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=160.38s)]
*  California has great weather. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=162.38s)]
*  The most expensive weather on Earth. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=163.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=164.38s)]
*  But— [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=165.38s)]
*  I like Florida. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=166.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=167.38s)]
*  They operate the way he's talking about. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=169.34s)]
*  Efficiently. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=171.74s)]
*  When you go into some of these states, you're going to find very little. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=172.74s)]
*  You're going to find almost nothing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  They really operate well. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=176.26s)]
*  Big surpluses, low taxes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=177.7s)]
*  You know, my taxes went up the first time you were president because you took away the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=179.9s)]
*  salt deduction. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=184.14s)]
*  Well, I did. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=185.14s)]
*  Which, by the way, I thought was the right decision. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=186.14s)]
*  It was the right decision. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=187.94s)]
*  In fact, Reagan tried to do it because it rewards badly run states. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=188.94s)]
*  But at the same time, it's tough for the states. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=195.22s)]
*  I mean, it really is tough for the states. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=198.3s)]
*  The sad part is it rewards really badly run states. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=200.26000000000002s)]
*  And Reagan tried to do it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=204.58s)]
*  He was unable to do it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=205.78s)]
*  I got it done. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=206.98000000000002s)]
*  You got it done. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  And now we're going to give some back. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=210.06s)]
*  How quickly do you balance the budget? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=211.38s)]
*  And when do we start paying down that debt? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=215.34s)]
*  Well, potentially very quickly, between what he's doing and with income coming in from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=217.74s)]
*  tariffs and other things. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=222.22s)]
*  I mean, I hope we can—I don't want to give a date because then these people are going [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=224.01999999999998s)]
*  to say, oh, well, he didn't make the date. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=227.22s)]
*  But I think we can do it very quickly. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=229.42s)]
*  We would have never done it if this didn't happen. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=231.82s)]
*  Never. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  It would have never been—it would only get worse and worse, and ultimately it would have [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  exploded. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=239.06s)]
*  This country was headed down a very bad track. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=240.42s)]
*  And the whole DEI thing, that was a trap. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=242.98s)]
*  That was a sick trap. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=247.33999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, we've destroyed that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  That's gone. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  That's pretty much gone. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  I agree. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=253.94s)]
*  We're not funding it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=254.94s)]
*  I really want to emphasize to people that—this is a very important point. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=255.94s)]
*  If we don't solve the deficit, there won't be money for medical care. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=260.58s)]
*  There won't be money for Social Security. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=263.98s)]
*  We either solve the deficit or all we'll be doing is paying debt. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=265.98s)]
*  Nobody's ever— [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=269.1s)]
*  And so it's got to be solved, or there's no medical care, there's no Social Security, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=270.1s)]
*  there's no nothing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  It's got to be solved. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not optional. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  America will go bankrupt if this is not done. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  That's why I'm here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=279.02s)]
*  The president's— [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=281.54s)]
*  Makes it advantageous. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=282.62s)]
*  And I'd also just send a message, like—because, as the president said, like, there's a lot [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=283.62s)]
*  of rich people out there—they should be caring more about the country, because the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=289.26000000000005s)]
*  reason they should be caring more about the country is if America falls, what do you think [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  is going to happen to your business? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=298.18s)]
*  What do you think—do you think it would be going to be okay if the ship of America [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=299.18s)]
*  sinks? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=303.42s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=304.42s)]
*  Like, what I'm doing here, what the president's doing, is just long-term thinking. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=305.42s)]
*  The ship of America must be strong. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=311.7s)]
*  Ship of America cannot sink. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=313.97999999999996s)]
*  If it sinks, we all sink with it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=315.18s)]
*  John, Europe— [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=317.42s)]
*  This is what drives you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=318.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=319.42s)]
*  This is important. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=320.42s)]
*  It says tech support. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=321.42s)]
*  So you're not trying to be president, as the media suggests. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=322.42s)]
*  You are really here because your heart and your passion is this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=325.02s)]
*  And then the president described you as being, this is the biggest thing you've ever done. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=329.86s)]
*  Now you're trying to bring sight to it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=335.38s)]
*  There could be nothing bigger. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=336.5s)]
*  You're sending ships up to Mars, you know, spaceships up in the sky all the time, and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=338.3s)]
*  saving astronauts. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=341.9s)]
*  That's pretty big. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=342.9s)]
*  That's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=343.9s)]
*  It's peanuts. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=344.9s)]
*  You agree with that? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=345.9s)]
*  Well, it's essential that America be healthy, that America's economy be strong. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=346.9s)]
*  And if that—basically, like, my concern is, like, if—America is the central pillar [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=354.62s)]
*  holding up Western civilization. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=361.7s)]
*  That pillar must be strong. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=363.66s)]
*  If that pillar falls, the whole roof comes crashing down. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=364.66s)]
*  There's no place to hide. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=368.17999999999995s)]
*  Including his ships going up. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=369.17999999999995s)]
*  There's no place to run. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=370.17999999999995s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=371.17999999999995s)]
*  There's nothing left. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=372.17999999999995s)]
*  Why, if this is your goal, your motivation, you're losing money in the process, you're [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=373.17999999999995s)]
*  offering—you do all these nice things for people for free, you're trying to solve, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=377.7s)]
*  you know, blindness, you're going to rescue astronauts, you help the people of North Carolina, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=381.53999999999996s)]
*  California, you're cutting money that was sent abroad that's not helping the American [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=386.29999999999995s)]
*  people, then why the rage? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=390.58s)]
*  Actually, I think it was like it was not helping American people and hurting people overseas, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=391.58s)]
*  to be clear. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=395.26s)]
*  Why this rage against you now? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=396.26s)]
*  First they hated him, now they hate both of you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=398.18s)]
*  Well, I think we're seeing an antibody reaction from those who are receiving the wasteful [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  and fraudulent money. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=405.94s)]
*  They've been exposed? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=407.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=409.18s)]
*  Nobody wants to be exposed with your cry. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=410.18s)]
*  I'll tell you a lesson I learned at PayPal. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=411.18s)]
*  You know who complained the loudest, the quickest and the loudest, and with the most amount [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=413.5s)]
*  of righteous indignation? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=418.74s)]
*  The fraudsters. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=420.38s)]
*  That's who complained first, loudest, and they would generally have this immense overreaction [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=421.38s)]
*  That's how we knew there were the fraudsters. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=428.02s)]
*  That's how we knew. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=429.02s)]
*  That's to tell. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=430.02s)]
*  What? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=431.02s)]
*  I've never met you before today. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=432.02s)]
*  And it's nice to meet you, by the way, and thank you for doing this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=437.02s)]
*  You guys are really friends. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=440.41999999999996s)]
*  I could see you kicking up your shoes. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=441.58s)]
*  Well, he doesn't do this kind of thing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  And the way I figured that you'd get to know him is if I did it with him, I said, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=445.46s)]
*  come on, let's do it together. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=449.74s)]
*  He doesn't do this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=450.74s)]
*  I think he's smarter not doing it overall, because, you know, I mean, he's done very [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=453.06s)]
*  well without doing it, but he doesn't feel it's really worthwhile. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=456.46000000000004s)]
*  He wants the product to speak for itself or whatever he does speak for itself, but he [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=462.18s)]
*  views it as, you know, does it matter? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=465.74s)]
*  And I'm doing this with you today because I wanted to have people understand him. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=468.62s)]
*  And I think it's very important. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=473.64s)]
*  I disagree with him, but I think it's very important that they do understand him. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=474.64s)]
*  He doesn't need this. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=479.90000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't need it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=481.24s)]
*  Now, I happen to think it's made him very popular. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=482.24s)]
*  I think he's more popular now because there are so many people, you know, you're talking [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=484.94s)]
*  about the radical left. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=488.58s)]
*  They have the lowest ratings. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=489.58s)]
*  MSNBC is dying. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=491.66s)]
*  CNN is dying. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=493.78000000000003s)]
*  They're all dying. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=495.9s)]
*  The New York Times is doing lousy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=497.02s)]
*  The Washington Post is doing horribly. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=498.7s)]
*  They're all doing badly because people don't buy it anymore. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=501.38s)]
*  But I think it was important that he do this one interview. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=504.62s)]
*  You've been a very fair guy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=509.1s)]
*  I think you were the right guy to do it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=510.18s)]
*  We could get some radical left guy and he'd do just as well, frankly, because it's all [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=512.26s)]
*  about common sense. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=517.02s)]
*  They would attack him as being an unconstitutional fascist. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=518.02s)]
*  But this—Charles, to me, this was important for people to understand. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=521.02s)]
*  He's doing a big job. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=524.3s)]
*  He's doing a very thankless job. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=525.54s)]
*  It's truly a thankless job. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=528.06s)]
*  But he's helping us to save our country. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=530.16s)]
*  Our country is in serious trouble. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=532.74s)]
*  And I had to get the best guy, somebody with credibility, because if he were just a regular [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=535.08s)]
*  good, very good, solid businessman, he wouldn't have the credibility. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=540.2199999999999s)]
*  He's got the best credibility for this. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=544.02s)]
*  And people also know he's an honest guy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=547.18s)]
*  He's an honest guy. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=549.06s)]
*  He's just a very, very smart guy who's done amazing things. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=550.2199999999999s)]
*  And this will be the biggest thing he's ever done, because, you know, his companies [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=555.4599999999999s)]
*  are all great. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=560.2199999999999s)]
*  But if this country goes bad—I guess where he is a little selfish is this. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=561.2199999999999s)]
*  He knows one thing and probably doesn't think. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=564.8399999999999s)]
*  But if his—if this country goes bad, his stuff is not going to be worth very much. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=567.58s)]
*  I can tell you. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=572.14s)]
*  Well, let's say if the ship of America sinks, we're all going down with it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=573.14s)]
*  You know, this idea that people can escape to New Zealand or some other place is false. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=576.6600000000001s)]
*  If the central pillar of Western civilization, that is, America, falls, the whole roof comes [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=582.0600000000001s)]
*  crashing down and there is no escape. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=586.74s)]
*  Do you anticipate you'll be here four years, my last question? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=588.34s)]
*  I hope I'll be as helpful as long as I can be helpful. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=591.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=594.82s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=595.82s)]
*  I mean, I was thinking about it just now. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=597.0600000000001s)]
*  I wonder how long he's going to be doing it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=598.58s)]
*  You can't get somebody like this. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  He cares, and he's brilliant, and he's got energy. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=603.0600000000001s)]
*  You need energy also, in addition to those other things. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=606.7800000000001s)]
*  You know, I have a lot of guys that are very smart, but they have no energy. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=609.1800000000001s)]
*  They want to sleep all day long. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=611.82s)]
*  You need a lot of energy. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=614.0200000000001s)]
*  He's got a lot of energy. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=615.0200000000001s)]
*  He's doing a great job. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=616.0200000000001s)]
*  If there's any conflict, he will stop it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=617.0200000000001s)]
*  But if he didn't, I'd stop it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=619.6600000000001s)]
*  I'd see if there's a conflict. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=621.22s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about big stuff. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=622.22s)]
*  But he's under a pretty big microscope. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=624.3800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, seriously. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=626.7800000000001s)]
*  I mean, everybody's watching him. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=627.7800000000001s)]
*  If there's a conflict, you're going to be reading about it within about two minutes [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=628.7800000000001s)]
*  after the conflict. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=631.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=632.74s)]
*  So the possibility of me getting away with something is 0 percent, 0.0. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=633.74s)]
*  I've scrutinized to a ridiculous degree. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=638.26s)]
*  And the other thing is that we're—you know, what's better than saying, trust me, is just [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=641.46s)]
*  full transparency. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=647.1s)]
*  So what we're doing with the Doge, just go to doge.gov. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=648.34s)]
*  You can see every single action that's been taken. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=652.1400000000001s)]
*  And I want to be clear. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=655.1400000000001s)]
*  We're all going to make some mistakes. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=656.5s)]
*  We're not going to be perfect. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=657.5s)]
*  Nobody bats a thousand. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=658.5s)]
*  But we're going to fix the mistakes very quickly. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=659.5s)]
*  That's what matters. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLSgCSdRGbo&t=662.14s)]
