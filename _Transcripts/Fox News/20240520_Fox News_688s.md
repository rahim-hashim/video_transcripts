# Hannity: NY v. Trump prosecutors rested their case without proving a thing
**Fox News:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI)
*  And welcome to Hannity. Wow. What a day in court. We'll get to that in a minute. By the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=0.0s)]
*  way, Joe Biden's phony promise to restore the soul of America is now more laughable [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=8.8s)]
*  than ever. This weekend, the self-proclaimed healer of souls screaming and yelling at Morehouse [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=14.24s)]
*  College graduates in one of the most divisive speeches ever given by a U S president. Take [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=20.34s)]
*  a look. What is democracy? The trail of broken promises [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=25.6s)]
*  still leave black communities behind. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=30.12s)]
*  Robert KKK's best friend and mentor. Anyway, coming up, we'll do what the media mob won't do. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=33.88s)]
*  We'll call out the lies, the smears, the hatred. We'll play an unusual moment where, well, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=39.8s)]
*  Joey seemed to believe that he was vice president during the beginning of the pandemic, COVID, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=44.84s)]
*  and that Obama sent him to Detroit to solve the problem. Also tonight, a tutorial from [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=50.6s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio, how every Republican needs to handle the hostile media mob in an [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=57.88s)]
*  interview. Here's a sneak peek. Hillary Clinton conceded. Senator, will you accept the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  election? Hillary Clinton said the election was stolen from her and that Trump was illegitimate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=68.48s)]
*  But she conceded. And you have Democrats now saying they won't certify 2024 because Trump [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  is an insurrectionist and ineligible to hold office. So you need to ask them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=77.44s)]
*  Every Republican watch and take notes because that's how to do it. Senator Rubio will join us [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  tonight. Also, we begin tonight, though, in New York City. Fireworks big time in that courtroom. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=87.28s)]
*  Another explosive day in the testimony of Juan Mershon's Kangaroo Court. Just hours ago, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  prosecutors rested their case against former President Donald Trump without proving a thing, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=98.8s)]
*  but not before more eye-opening testimony from the state's so-called star witness, Michael Cohn. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=104.16s)]
*  As it turns out, Cohn is not only a liar, also a thief. Now, Cohn was completely gutted once [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=110.32s)]
*  again by defense on cross-examination. And today, Michael Cohn admitted on the stand that he stole [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=116.8s)]
*  tens of thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization. Well, for a guy like Trump that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=122.64s)]
*  paid such close attention, how would that happen? Now, according to one fake news CNN analyst, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=127.92s)]
*  quote, this is a more serious crime than what Donald Trump is on trial for. And guess what? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=133.92s)]
*  That New York DA brag, he knew all about it, but his last name isn't Trump. He hates Trump. Now, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  even the media mob is forced to admit that this political witch hunt is imploding. Take a look. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=146.16s)]
*  I'm still kind of reeling from the revelation that Michael Cohn stole money from the Trump [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=152.4s)]
*  Organization. And that wasn't, at least to my knowledge, that the prosecution didn't get that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=158.88s)]
*  out earlier. The prosecution has painted Michael Cohn as sort of this bumbling, pathetic character [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=164.8s)]
*  whose only sins were his misguided, undying loyalty to Donald Trump. But now you see something a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=170.56s)]
*  little different. Now there's an argument to be made that actually you're just an opportunistic [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=177.12s)]
*  thief. The fact that he was never charged with larceny is important because stealing $60,000 [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  through fraud, which would be larceny in New York State, is more serious of a crime than falsifying [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=189.44s)]
*  They knew about this. They minimized it. The prosecutor misled this jury. That's what I would argue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=195.44s)]
*  Are you allowed to say that? Yes, sir. Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=201.11999999999998s)]
*  Well, even fake Jake didn't give opinion, left-wing opinion for a minute. Anyway, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=204.72s)]
*  unfortunately, one particularly deranged MSDNC host still defending Michael Cohn. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  He's shocked. I'm not. Take a look. He very effectively got Michael Cohen to say, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  to agree that, yes, he stole $30,000. Later when Cohen was asked about that on redirect [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=221.04s)]
*  by the prosecution, it didn't really sound like stealing $30,000. It sounded a lot like Michael [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=228.0s)]
*  Cohen doing the little that he could within that calculation to rebalance the bonus he thought he [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=233.6s)]
*  deserved. And it still came out as less than the bonus he thought he deserved and the bonus he'd [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=241.92s)]
*  gotten the year before. Now let's compare MSDNC to the actual transcript. Trump's lawyer asked, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=247.04s)]
*  quote, you stole from the Trump organization, right? Cohen responded, quote, yes, sir. Now, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=254.48s)]
*  you don't have to be a legal scholar now, do you? But I'm pretty sure that that means Cohen admitted [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=261.36s)]
*  to stealing from the Trump organization. But don't expect any charges from Alvin Bragg. He's only [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  interested in getting Donald Trump as he made a promise on the campaign trail. Unfortunately for [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=272.72s)]
*  Bragg, his star witness has been a complete unmitigated disaster. Cohen even admitted to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=278.16s)]
*  having a financial interest in the case. Can't make that up either. Cohen said he's trying to get a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=283.44000000000005s)]
*  reality TV show picked up and might even use this trial as a way to run for Congress. According to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=288.56s)]
*  testimony, Cohen has already made millions on the anti-Trump hatred through book deals, podcasts, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=294.16s)]
*  and of course, whatever gifts that he's getting on social media. In order why? To salvage this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=300.56s)]
*  train wreck? Well, the prosecution, they're now at this late hour, they're going to need a lot of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=306.08s)]
*  help. But lucky for them, they have Judge Juan Mershon, a compromised Biden donor who is blatantly, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=311.12s)]
*  abusively against all things Donald Trump. And today, as Trump's defense began to present their [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=319.76s)]
*  case, oh, well, Juan Mershon, well, he appeared ready, willing and able to give Bragg a helping [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=326.24s)]
*  hand. He knows probably deep in his heart this has fallen apart and he's trying to salvage this [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=332.8s)]
*  failing trial. At one point, Judge Mershon exploded on Robert Costello, a guy with impeccable [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=337.92s)]
*  credentials while trying to limit the scope of his testimony, even threatened to remove him from [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=344.8s)]
*  the courtroom for rolling his eyes and question, are you staring me down? Really? As a reminder, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=349.76s)]
*  the defense called on Costello. Why? Because of this compelling story. Take a look. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=357.92s)]
*  Basically, they only put in a small cherry picked group of emails. I presented maybe two to three [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=363.68s)]
*  hundred emails and text messages to them. I had them with me, luckily, in chronological order. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=371.28s)]
*  They put two or three into evidence. I asked them, are you going to put the rest of them into [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=377.28s)]
*  evidence? And they said no. He said specifically, and I cross-examined him on this, this was my idea. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=381.76s)]
*  It was his idea to take care of the NDA because he had been contacted by a lawyer for Stormy [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=390.64s)]
*  Daniels, who said she was going to claim that Donald Trump had sex with her. Cohen said, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=395.84s)]
*  I didn't believe the allegation, but nevertheless, it would be embarrassing to Melania. That's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=400.55999999999995s)]
*  Michael Cohen's words. He said, and so I decided to take care of this myself. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=406.16s)]
*  And according to testimony, well, apparently that story was told to many people in the media mob. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  Here's Eric Trump, who will join us in a minute. He was in the courtroom today. Here's his quote. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=418.56s)]
*  Now, the judge's treatment of Bob Costello is truly disgraceful. He would not allow him to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=422.88s)]
*  tell his story, the same story that he told Congress, as he knows it will be devastating [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=427.44000000000005s)]
*  and end this sham trial. This is not justice. He's correct. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=433.52s)]
*  Mershawn let Stormy Daniels testify about ghosts, X-rated stories that were immaterial, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  irrelevant to the case. But the moment Robert Costello begins to testify about [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=444.24s)]
*  his interactions with Michael Cohen, their star witness, and impeach his testimony as a regard [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  to the NDA and him saying over and over again that in fact he did it on his own. Well, Judge [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=456.88s)]
*  Juan Mershawn saw it to limit Costello's testimony, ultimately even threatened to kick him out of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=463.28s)]
*  court. Judge Mershawn also put strict limitations on another witness that is going to be used by the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  defense, Bradley Smith, former FEC commissioner and an expert on federal election crimes. Now, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=475.35999999999996s)]
*  keep in mind, a critical part of the prosecution's case against Donald Trump, it is nebulous. This is [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=482.96s)]
*  a novel federal election crime theory. He was never charged in any way, shape, manner, or form, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=488.56s)]
*  not even identified. But Mershawn is prohibiting Bradley Smith from testifying in full about the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=495.36s)]
*  law in a court of law based on the legal statute in the law. Is this not Banana Republic kangaroo [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=502.08s)]
*  court stuff? But it's obvious what the judge is doing. Now, here's Bradley Smith on this very [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=510.64s)]
*  program, he was also on Levin's program recently. Take a look. The claim made by the DA's, the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=516.24s)]
*  federal law says something is a campaign contribution if it's made for the purpose of influencing a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=522.8s)]
*  campaign. And that's the argument, well, they were trying to do this because they thought if [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=528.32s)]
*  they could pay hush money to Stormy Daniels that would help Trump's campaign. So that's the theory. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=532.4s)]
*  Most of us would not think that it is a campaign expenditure to try to settle potential legal [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=536.88s)]
*  claims against you or other claims against you for events that occurred 10 years before you [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=542.88s)]
*  talked about running for office, you know, to pay, allegedly to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels or [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=548.32s)]
*  anybody else. And the odd theory of the DA Bragg is that not only could those expenses be paid with [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=554.88s)]
*  campaign funds, they would have to be paid with campaign funds. I think, again, it's a common [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=561.76s)]
*  sense matter, that's clearly wrong, but also when you look at the statute and you realize that's an [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=566.4s)]
*  objective standard, it's clearly not correct to say that these were funds that count as a campaign [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=569.76s)]
*  expenditure. Between Costello and Smith, it would be game over for Alvin Bragg. And Mershawn knows [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=574.64s)]
*  that, so he's doing whatever he can to limit Donald Trump's defense in a court of law and throw a [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=580.72s)]
*  lifeline, what, to Alvin Bragg. Why? Because he's trying to save this case that has gone down the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=586.64s)]
*  absolute tubes. This is what the weaponization of Biden's DOJ looks like. This is lawfare. It's [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=592.88s)]
*  plain and simple. Even the far left director, Oliver Stone, is speaking out against this massive [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=599.28s)]
*  abuse of power, calling it the new form of warfare, lawfare. Now, make no mistake, there is no crime [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=604.88s)]
*  here. There's no evidence here. Bragg's entire case hinges on, you know, uncorrobed rated claims [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=611.76s)]
*  from a convicted liar and apparently thief who hates Donald Trump by admission, who himself would [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=618.4s)]
*  benefit from Trump's conviction and even testify that he told multiple people that Trump knew [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KftptdChI&t=624.88s)]
