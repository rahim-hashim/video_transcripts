# Would the Democratic National Convention go remote to avoid protesters?
**Fox News:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY)
*  Here with reaction Fox and Friends weekend co-host Pete Hegseth Fox News contributed Charlie hurt and former former Florida Attorney General [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=0.0s)]
*  Pam Bondi Pam let's start with I think the thing that intrigues me the most tonight is [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Watching the Democratic Party be so fearful of their own radical base that they want to what have a [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=14.36s)]
*  semi-virtual convention out of Chicago [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=22.88s)]
*  Really, they're that afraid of their own their own voters [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=26.12s)]
*  Well and Sean they're also afraid of their own the city of Chicago the new mayor in Chicago is really just as bad as Lori [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=31.0s)]
*  Lightfoot he has said very publicly that he values [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=39.16s)]
*  Protest these are rioters that we're seeing out there now not protesters. So no, they wouldn't even be safe [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=43.08s)]
*  They wouldn't even be safe inside their convention and frankly [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=49.16s)]
*  I don't even think as you like to call him jacked up Joe as they had him at the State of the Union [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Could even give a decent speech [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  So I think it helps them all the way around to go to online and you know [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  their solution to this was they were going to have [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=64.66s)]
*  Protests when the protesters came on they were going to have people come on and chant for more years and cover them with banners [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=68.88s)]
*  That would erupt into violence and they know it so they have no good plan. No safety and they don't support law enforcement [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=76.0s)]
*  That's why they can't have law enforcement in there during the convention [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=81.84s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way Pete I would not be surprised if they actually send their radical base to Milwaukee with a Republican National Convention [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=87.0s)]
*  It'll take place. Yeah in in July [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  That wouldn't shock me at all [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  However, I don't think the Republicans would ever consider a semi, you know online convention [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=99.56s)]
*  But it's obvious that the radicals in their party. They have shaken Joe Biden to the core [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=106.32s)]
*  It has now caused him to abandon America and their commitment to liberty and freedom [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=111.97999999999999s)]
*  It has now caused Joe Biden to surrender in the war on terrorism [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=118.02s)]
*  These are consequential times our allies are watching our enemies are watching [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=122.69999999999999s)]
*  Sean you're right. The Hamas caucus is in charge Bernie Sanders is right. This is his [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  Vietnam moment because in revelations, there's a verse that says if you're lukewarm if you're lukewarm, you're neither hot and you're cold [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=133.14s)]
*  I'll spit you out of my mouth and right now Joe Biden is lukewarm [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=140.78s)]
*  Front and center. Nobody supports what he's doing because he doesn't support anything [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=144.66s)]
*  The only thing he believes in is trying to get himself reelected. Here's the problem Sean when you look at Chicago in 1968 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=148.34s)]
*  Do you remember president Hubert Humphrey? I don't either because he lost in 1968 because the convention was part and parcel of the disaster [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=154.62s)]
*  For Democrats, they can't cover up the death disaster. That is Joe. So there go virtual basement strategy [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=163.26000000000002s)]
*  No debates hide the guy that everybody knows not capable [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=170.0s)]
*  They don't have any good options and right now the bad part is Sean [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=172.92s)]
*  We're bearing the consequences of this from the economy to the border to our embarrassing foreign policy [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=176.2s)]
*  We look bad, but Joe's trying to salvage himself off the of the dust beep dustbin [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=181.28s)]
*  It's not gonna work, but there's gonna be a lot of chaos in between [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=186.28s)]
*  Yeah, what's your take on Charlie hurt? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=189.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think that you know [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Obviously a convention is supposed to be an opportunity for a party to come together and have a good time [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=193.4s)]
*  We've all been to conventions where people have a great time [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=199.6s)]
*  But if you're a party of truly miserable people who hate their country hate their their fellow [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=202.6s)]
*  Countrymen as much as Democrats do today and Pete's right. It is the you know, the Hamas [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=209.0s)]
*  Caucus is in charge of the Democrat Party today a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=216.64s)]
*  Convention is the most miserable thing you could possibly get yes putting everybody in the same room is a recipe for absolute disaster [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=219.6s)]
*  And of course they will absolutely do this because we saw what they did in 2020 [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=226.28s)]
*  They would have canceled the whole election if they could have gotten away with it. They did everything but that by making it all [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=232.36s)]
*  mail-in and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=238.88s)]
*  And and the whole and Joe Biden's entire campaign remember all the ridiculous car honking [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=240.76s)]
*  And then even then they could only get like eight cars to park in a parking lot to honk their horns [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  But my big concern about this is whatever Democrats do the mainstream media is going to cover for them as [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=252.56s)]
*  Much as they can and they're going to pretend like whatever they do to do it like a remote [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=259.8s)]
*  Convention is perfectly normal even though it's really weird and it really exposes [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=266.08s)]
*  How corrupt and dishonest the Democrat Party has become? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  Pam let me ask the question about RFK jr. Because there's talk about okay if there is a three-person race is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=276.52s)]
*  He more likely to peel away votes from Donald Trump or from Joe Biden, okay? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=283.56s)]
*  I think once Republicans and conservatives know the record of Robert F. Kennedy jr. Robert Kennedy jr. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=289.38s)]
*  Let me tell you they're not gonna vote for him [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  You know [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=298.36s)]
*  This is a guy that what wants abortion up to the ninth month the guy praising Fidel Castro a guy that wants zero [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=298.92s)]
*  Oil drilling at all no fracking at all no fossil fuels at all attacks on carbon emissions [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=305.92s)]
*  This is a guy that called the NRA a terrorist group. This is a guy that's all for affirmative action [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=312.84s)]
*  this is a guy that literally wants to transform the police and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=319.32s)]
*  transition prisons from [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=325.0s)]
*  punishment paradigm to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=327.12s)]
*  Caution a guy that praised Louis Farrakhan wants a $15 minimum wage free childcare [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=329.16s)]
*  You know he supported Al Gore. He supported Obama. He supported Hillary Clinton every Democrat [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=336.52s)]
*  That's ever run and and donated to them as well, and then he blamed America [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  for [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=348.48s)]
*  Osama bin Laden and the attack on 9-eleven he actually made that statement. We played it last night [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=349.88s)]
*  We played the comments about abortion last night, and he once praised China and their organ harvesting [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  Threats to meet climate change you kidding me [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=363.2s)]
*  This this is the most radical leftist, and he loves Bernie Sanders on top of it all [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=367.08s)]
*  Sean he is a wolf in sheep's clothing people need to realize that you just laid it out beautifully [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=374.36s)]
*  Not only that he has been praising [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=379.88s)]
*  Cuba's socialist health care can you imagine that if that came to our country? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=382.64s)]
*  He has been saying his bragging about his children being pen pals with Fidel Castro when he was living [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=386.96s)]
*  He wants to cut our military even more than they're cutting them now [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  He would be horrific as president and people need to hear what you're saying I [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=397.84s)]
*  I think Pete Hicks says it once every Republican and conservative [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=402.91999999999996s)]
*  Knows that list that we were scrolling and I was reading my own list [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=408.52s)]
*  There's no way a conservative or a Republican would choose him over Donald Trump not gonna happen [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=414.6s)]
*  This is a smart move by the Trump campaign because I think there are a lot of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=421.0s)]
*  Conservatives and Republicans that looked at RFK and said well on some of the kovats stuff or on some of the foreign policy stuff [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=424.32s)]
*  We could agree with him. He sounds different than Democrats [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=431.44s)]
*  Maybe he's an interesting independent model and he'd spin out little nuggets of things that sound reasonable [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=434.08s)]
*  But when you actually look underneath the curtain a vote for RFK if you happen to be right of center is a vote [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=439.68s)]
*  For Joe Biden because you're taking a vote away from Donald Trump [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=446.2s)]
*  So this is a great smart twofer define him for what he is [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  He's a far leftist which means maybe the folks on the left who are dissatisfied with Joe Biden [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=451.97999999999996s)]
*  They go home to RFK. Go ahead. Go home to him if you were gonna vote for Biden [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=456.76s)]
*  Otherwise save your vote for Donald Trump [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=460.36s)]
*  You know Charlie we gave him a town hall on this show we did it in New York [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=463.12s)]
*  Personally nice guy. However, I gave him a lot of time to talk now that a lot of his record has come to light [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  He's avoiding this show like the plague. He won't come on the show [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=475.88s)]
*  I guess I can't blame him because he'd have to answer a lot of tough questions and explain a lot of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=479.0s)]
*  bizarre positions that he has but [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=485.76s)]
*  It's interesting how he's gone silent on coming on this program, what's your reaction? Well, it really is [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=488.48s)]
*  I think it's kind of interesting. I think one of the reasons that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=494.52s)]
*  Conservatives or Republicans were initially sort of interested in him is because he is a disruptor and they kind of like that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=497.96s)]
*  Also conservative media is the only open-minded media [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=503.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think his position on the COVID vaccine was probably the most appealing thing to conservatives [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  But you know, no, absolutely and but a disruptor and a disruptor especially when it comes to think to medicine [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=515.8s)]
*  But I love that you played the clip of him talk about how much he loves NPR [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=522.76s)]
*  Because I can assure you that of the people who are really in the bag for RFK, Jr [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=527.3199999999999s)]
*  They're all the exact same people who listen to National People's Radio and you'll never see a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=532.92s)]
*  Subaru going down the road today with an RFK sticker that doesn't also have an NPR sticker on the back of it [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=538.92s)]
*  So I think naturally speaking [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=545.32s)]
*  All of his voters are going to come from Joe Biden's base in the end not Donald Trump's [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=547.72s)]
*  Yeah abortion up to the last minute the NRA is a terrorist organization [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=553.7600000000001s)]
*  And you know that guy Fidel Castro the thug murderer dictator vacation, you know, it's very charming [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lgeD3-kOY&t=557.9200000000001s)]
