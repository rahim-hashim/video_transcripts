# Hannity: Buckle up, Biden will do this over and over again
**Fox News:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0)
*  A forge in Pennsylvania nearly 250 years ago, during a bitterly cold and wet winter, George [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=0.0s)]
*  Washington stationed the Continental Army on this rural plateau just outside of Philadelphia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=6.92s)]
*  Now, the defensible position, it gave Washington's exhausted troops time to rest, recover, recoup [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=14.0s)]
*  and retrain for what was the long war ahead. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=21.36s)]
*  Now, tomorrow, President Joe Biden was set to give a big speech near the very site in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=25.08s)]
*  Valley Forge, but not to commemorate Washington or the heroes in the Continental Army who [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=30.44s)]
*  won America's fight for independence. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=39.08s)]
*  Instead, Biden planned to commemorate, oh, that's right, the Capitol riot on January [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=40.08s)]
*  6th, 2021. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=45.36s)]
*  But due to possible snow and the forecast, the speech was moved up and took place just [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=47.06s)]
*  a few hours ago. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=52.16s)]
*  Now remember, slick conditions can be fatal for a president as frail and weak as Joe Biden. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=53.68s)]
*  As I've been saying, he is one fall away and the Democrats may very well be forced to pick [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=60.24s)]
*  a new nominee for 2024. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=65.72s)]
*  Now, of course, the content of today's venomous speech remain the same. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=67.24s)]
*  To sum it all up, as I told you, you're going to hear this all election season long. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=72.6s)]
*  According to Biden, those who want to make America great again, you want to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=78.24s)]
*  America to be great again, you are a threat to democracy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  And only Joe Biden, who doesn't know what day it is, can save us from ourselves. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=87.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=92.64s)]
*  Just one day before January 6th, a day forever shared in our memory because it was on that day [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  that we nearly lost America, lost it all. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Today, we're here to answer the most important of questions. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=106.56s)]
*  Is democracy still America's sacred cause? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=110.16s)]
*  This is not rhetorical, academic or hypothetical. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  And it's what the 2024 election is all about. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=125.36s)]
*  The choice is clear. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=129.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign is about him, not America, not you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=131.36s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  Because of Donald Trump's lies, they died because these lies brought a mob to Washington. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=142.08s)]
*  He promised it would be wild, and it was. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=149.52s)]
*  He told the crowd to fight like hell. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  He forgot the words, peacefully, patriotically, march to the Capitol so your voices will be heard. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=155.28s)]
*  How convenient. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  Now, also noticeably missing from those remarks, any mention of the economy, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  or inflation, or national security, or violent crime, or the fentanyl crisis. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=166.8s)]
*  Now, in a blistering response, former President Trump told Fox News, quote, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden is the worst president in the history of the United States. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=176.56s)]
*  He is incompetent. He's crooked. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=180.96s)]
*  And in many respects, he is Benedict Arnold. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=183.12s)]
*  He is destroying our country like no one else has done before. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=186.56s)]
*  And meanwhile, we've heard the same divisive speech from Biden before. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=190.72s)]
*  And get ready and buckle up. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=195.04s)]
*  As I said Tuesday, my first show back for the new year, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=196.8s)]
*  he will do this over and over and over again throughout the 2024 campaign. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=200.16s)]
*  In fact, it's one of the only things Democrats are going to want to talk about in the lead-up [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=205.44s)]
*  to the election. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=210.24s)]
*  Here is their plan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=211.36s)]
*  Watch for it, notice it, observe it, and, you know, embrace this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=212.88s)]
*  You know what they're going to do. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=217.28s)]
*  They will focus on Trump, Trump, Trump, January 6, January 6, January 6. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=219.2s)]
*  By the way, without any context that should be relevant, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=224.16s)]
*  without any mention of the 2020 riots that they refer to as mostly peaceful, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=228.32s)]
*  they will demagogue abortion. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  And whenever possible, they will dust off the usual playbook that the Democratic Party has. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=234.88s)]
*  Republicans are racist, sexist, misogynist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, transphobic. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=240.64s)]
*  The GOP wants dirty air and dirty water, and they want some prominent Republican to push [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=247.44s)]
*  your grandma and grandpa off a cliff. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, in contrast, here's what they won't talk about, and it's a long list. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=256.24s)]
*  They're not going to talk about the failure of Joe Biden's border crisis. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=260.8s)]
*  They're not going to talk about the drug crisis. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=265.12s)]
*  They're not going to talk about Joe Biden's inflation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=267.2s)]
*  They're not going to talk about the horrible educational system [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=269.76s)]
*  because of the Democratic Party's unholy alliance with Teachers Union. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=273.35999999999996s)]
*  They're not going to talk about affordable housing, homelessness, Bidenomics. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=277.28s)]
*  They've been talking about it for a year. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=281.11999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, guess what? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=282.88s)]
*  Only 34 percent of Americans actually think the economy is even decent. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  They won't talk about law and order and safety and security. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  They don't want to talk about international affairs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  They don't want to talk about the war in Ukraine and Europe. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=294.96s)]
*  They don't want to talk about the war in the Middle East and Gaza. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  They don't want to call terrorism. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=300.64s)]
*  And the terror attacks against our troops. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=302.96s)]
*  They don't want to talk about the failure of their new Green Deal socialism. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=305.2s)]
*  And get this, even life expectancy has gone down under Joe Biden. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=310.0s)]
*  Joe Biden pretty much has failed at everything. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=314.88s)]
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=317.52s)]
*  So, of course, they don't want to talk about accomplishments [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=320.0s)]
*  because I can't think of any. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  Can you? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, in fact, you probably won't see or hear a whole lot from Biden in the coming months. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=325.76s)]
*  The media will aid and abet him hiding in the basement of the White House once again. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=330.4s)]
*  And it appears that he's headed back to that basement. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=335.28s)]
*  And Joe is frankly, he is not up to the rigors of the job, never mind a campaign. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=337.92s)]
*  Now, here's Biden's recent schedule, according to the RNC research. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=343.92s)]
*  On December 22nd, he actually spent a few minutes at a children's hospital in Washington, D.C., [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=347.6s)]
*  about nine minutes. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=353.12s)]
*  Anyway, then he left for vacation at Camp David. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=354.56s)]
*  He remained on vacation until the 26th. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=357.76s)]
*  And then the very next day, he left for another vacation, this one in the U.S. Virgin Islands. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=360.64s)]
*  And as evidenced by his horrific sunburn, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=366.0s)]
*  well, Biden baked in the Caribbean heat for the next seven days during a relaxing stay in St. Croix. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  Then he returned to D.C. on the night of January 2nd. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=375.36s)]
*  The next two days, he appeared to do absolutely, positively nothing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=378.64s)]
*  That brings us to today's big event, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=383.12s)]
*  a speech about how his political opponents are evil. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=385.2s)]
*  In theory, Biden has two very difficult jobs, one as commander in chief and another on the campaign trail. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=388.8s)]
*  But it certainly appears with anybody with eyes to see that Biden is doing neither of those jobs. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=395.84s)]
*  And yet he wants you, the American people, to rubber stamp a second term. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=402.8s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm1RRu9TPf0&t=415.2s)]
