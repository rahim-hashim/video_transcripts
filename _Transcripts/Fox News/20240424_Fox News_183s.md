# Anti-Israel protesters can't seem to define 'from the river to the sea'
**Fox News:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE)
*  Here with the latest on the ground at Columbia University, our very own Sarah Carter. Sarah, welcome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, thanks so much, Sean. You know, anti-Israel, pro-Hamas protests continued here today [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=7.76s)]
*  at Columbia University despite growing concerns among Jewish faculty and staff [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=13.76s)]
*  that they are no longer safe here on campus. Sean, we spent the day here with them, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=19.36s)]
*  although initially many of the protesters refused to speak with me. Eventually, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=24.479999999999997s)]
*  some of them broke and they did talk, and this is what they had to say. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=29.52s)]
*  Everybody in America wants to know why you're all here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=34.4s)]
*  What does that mean? What is that? What is disclose divest? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=39.12s)]
*  No? Hamas attacked Israel, but they didn't attack IDF. They attacked women and children. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=43.68s)]
*  That's what's been documented. What does from the river to the sea mean? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=60.4s)]
*  Um, it means that Palestine should be, it should be autonomous. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=65.52s)]
*  What river? Um, okay. The expression is not anything bad. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  No, there's an actual river and an actual sea. Yeah, I'm aware of this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  No, no, but what river, what sea? Um, the river that's the middle east, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=82.72s)]
*  that literally is beside Israel and the Palestinian territories. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=88.32s)]
*  What? It's the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  October 7th, Hamas attacked women and children. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=100.24s)]
*  Does Israel have a right to defend itself? I'm asking you a question too. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  Does Israel have a right to defend itself? No one has a right to kill 30,000 people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  No one has a right to dismember babies and put them in ovens and kill them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  That never happened. What is your solution? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=117.76s)]
*  I miss you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Sean, there was continued, continued calls for more security here at Columbia University [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=125.68s)]
*  and across the nation as antisemitism appears to be on the rise. They expect these protests [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=132.24s)]
*  to continue throughout the week and some even suggest that these protests will continue next [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=138.16s)]
*  week. One thing is certain is that Jewish students and Jewish faculty are looking for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=142.96s)]
*  help and they're looking for answers and they're expecting the Biden administration [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  to make a statement. Sean? You know, how could somebody, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=152.24s)]
*  an Ivy League institution, supposedly the best and brightest get into that, that type of school? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  That never happened. Yeah, it happened. And we have the video evidence. Many of us have seen it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=163.28s)]
*  Sarah Carter, great job. Thank you. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8PQ5ktQPE&t=169.12s)]
