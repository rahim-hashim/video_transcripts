# James Comer: I can confirm this looks like money laundering
**Fox News:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w)
*  All right, here now with reaction we have House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer along [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=0.0s)]
*  with the chairman of the ever so important House Ways and Means Committee, Jason Smith. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=4.24s)]
*  Chairman Comer, let me start with you. Let me get your general reaction to all of this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=9.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, I'm not surprised. Look, this is one of many crimes that Hunter Biden [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=16.32s)]
*  has committed. We believe that if you're going the tax evasion route, not only did he evade taxes on [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  the obvious income that that WISH charged him with, but also the loans, and that's something [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=29.2s)]
*  that Jason Smith and the Ways and Means Committee are looking into as well. We believe that if you [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=34.64s)]
*  look at the loans that Jim Biden and Hunter Biden had, there's over $13 million in loans [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=40.56s)]
*  and no trace of principal payments, much less interest payments. So at what point does a loan [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=48.56s)]
*  become income? We believe there's significantly more tax liability than what he has. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=54.32s)]
*  We also know that there's money laundering. We get that from all the suspicious activity reports. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=58.8s)]
*  Most of the 170 suspicious activity reports at Treasury imply that the Bidens were money [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=64.72s)]
*  laundering. And from what we can look at with their bank statements now and the research we've done, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=70.08s)]
*  I can confirm it sure looks like money laundering to me. You also have the obvious violation of the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=76.08s)]
*  Foreign Agents Registration Act. And who was he lobbying for? He was lobbying for China, Russia, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=82.4s)]
*  and some of the worst countries in the world. But also, he was lobbying his father. So that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=88.56s)]
*  makes Joe Biden liable in Foreign Agents Registration Act liabilities. So we've got a lot [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=93.76s)]
*  of concerns here. This is the tip of the iceberg. I'm not surprised it happened before this week, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=100.0s)]
*  but this case is far from being over. How much money are we talking about, Congressman? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=105.12s)]
*  Well, we know they've gotten over $24 million from our enemies around the world. Now we're finding [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=110.64s)]
*  all these loans. Jason Smith just released parts of the transcript from the whistleblowers. You've [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=118.16s)]
*  heard John Solomon break the story that there's another, an additional $3 million that he may owe [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=125.6s)]
*  Kevin Morris. What are the terms of that? Is he ever going to pay it back? If you have a loan [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=132.88s)]
*  for years and years and years and you don't ever pay any payments on it or have any intention of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=137.28s)]
*  paying it back, then that's income. If you take $13 million in loans that we've identified with [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=142.16s)]
*  the president's family, that's another $4 million in federal income taxes that they would owe in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=148.64s)]
*  addition to evading taxes. I mean, there are many, many problems here, but at the heart of this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=154.08s)]
*  is Joe Biden. All of this revenue came because of Joe Biden. Joe Biden knew what his son was doing, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=160.0s)]
*  he knew what his brother was doing. He met with all the people, even though he said he never met [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=165.44s)]
*  with him, he continues to lie about it. He did it this week. This is a concern. We fear this president [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=169.76s)]
*  is compromised. We know he's been dishonest with the American people, and that's why we're pressing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  forward with the impeachment inquiry next week. Let me ask you, Congressman Smith, we learned a [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=179.76s)]
*  lot more this week in your committee where Gary Shapley and Joe Ziegler testified before your [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=186.16s)]
*  committee. What did you learn this week that we didn't know before? First off, Sean, we would not [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  be where we are today if it was not for those two brave whistleblowers that came before the Ways and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=200.8s)]
*  Means Committee back in May. That led to all of the items that have been pointed out. In fact, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  they highlighted all of the tax crimes that were charged yesterday that they should have been [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=214.08s)]
*  charged years ago. They've also highlighted how the Justice Department obstructed their [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=220.24s)]
*  investigation in ways that they have never seen before. And they highlighted, in fact, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  where numerous leads led to President Joe Biden, but they were halted, stopped in their tracks. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=232.08s)]
*  Search warrants with public figure one being President Biden were removed. There was numerous, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=238.88s)]
*  numerous examples that led to President Biden. For example, Kevin Morris, that was mentioned by [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Comer, the gentleman who originally paid off $2 million of Hunter Biden's loans, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  they testified this week that it's in fact $4.9 million of loans and payments that Kevin Morris [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=259.52s)]
*  has delivered to Hunter Biden. And what's really important, they also delivered an email [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=267.12s)]
*  that Kevin Morris sent the tax preparer for Hunter Biden saying, we have to pay these tax returns [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=272.72s)]
*  or it will be personally and politically liable. That was three weeks before Super Tuesday, which [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=278.88000000000005s)]
*  ultimately decided Joe Biden as the nominee, the Democrat nominee for president. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this too. All right, we have all of the lies told. I'll ask both of you [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  the same question. We have the suspicious activity reports. We have all these shell companies that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  you've identified the sheer amount of money, tens of millions of dollars, no services that we can [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=300.8s)]
*  identify rendered. We have what? 10 family members that have gotten paid, including grandkids. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=309.2s)]
*  Can you explain to me how much money we're talking about and how sophisticated this was, James Comer? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=317.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's over $30 million now, and we have no idea what they did to receive the money. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=324.88s)]
*  Were they lobbying those countries? If so, that's simple. That's a Foreign Agents Registration Act [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=333.12s)]
*  violation. That's a penalty of up to five years imprisonment and $250,000 fund. So we've got a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=338.24s)]
*  lot of questions for Hunter Biden about specific transactions. This may, $100,000 wire here, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  $5 million wire there. He told one bank examiner it appears that that $5 million wire from China [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=353.76s)]
*  was a loan. It appears he told another bank examiner that it was a fee for lobbying. Either [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  way, he's in trouble because either way, he wasn't telling the truth from what we believe [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=365.12s)]
*  the real answers are. So that's why we're bringing him in for a deposition. We have [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=370.8s)]
*  hundreds of specific questions that we have to ask Hunter Biden. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=375.2s)]
*  It's also about Joe Biden, isn't it? It's more about Joe Biden. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=379.44s)]
*  This is an investigation of Joe Biden. Joe Biden knew about this. And if he had been honest [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=384.48s)]
*  with the American people from day one, he may have gotten away with this. But the fact that he said [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=390.64s)]
*  he never met with any of these people, he never talked to any of these people, that Hunter Biden [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=395.84s)]
*  had a wall between his personal life and the government, all of this is proven to be false. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=401.68s)]
*  And now the fact that we found these pseudonym emails, tens of thousands, 82,000 pseudonym [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=407.28s)]
*  emails that Joe Biden used, many of them were sent to people he swore he never even talked to. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=413.2s)]
*  So, and the fact that they're covering this up, Sean, it's not only the crimes the Biden's [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=419.2s)]
*  have committed, it's the cover-up. The government should be held accountable. Every single person [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=423.76s)]
*  who was involved in this cover-up, and that's the goal of what Jason Smith and I are trying to do, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  along with Jim Jordan. All right. We'll give you the last [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=433.52s)]
*  word, Jason Smith. Where do you see this going in terms of Joe Biden? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=436.64s)]
*  Well, this entire investigation is about Joe Biden. I agree with what Chairman Comer just said. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=442.56s)]
*  We are looking at, from the Ways and Means Committee, I want to see the tax returns, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=448.96s)]
*  the tax returns that President Biden has publicly released. There's no indication [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  that he ever received any interest income. However, we know that he's received more than [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=460.0s)]
*  $240,000 worth of loan repayments from his brother. Those loan repayments should have interest income. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=466.16s)]
*  And if the president wasn't reporting interest income, that's a crime. His son just got charged [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=475.28s)]
*  with nine tax crimes yesterday. Apparently, it might run in the family. And by the way, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=481.84s)]
*  you would have to pay interest, right, for it to be a real loan? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=488.96s)]
*  Absolutely. In order for it to be a real loan, you would have to pay interest. If you did not, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=493.68s)]
*  it would have to be recognized in your taxes as a gift, which you would also have to pay taxes on. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  All right. Chairman Comer, Chairman Smith, thank you both. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cun7C1dp3w&t=504.15999999999997s)]
