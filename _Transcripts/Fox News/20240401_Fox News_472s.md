# Sean Hannity: This ‘reeks’ of desperation
**Fox News:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, as Joe Biden continues to deteriorate, right before your eyes, one thing does remain [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=7.18s)]
*  constant. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=13.24s)]
*  The president is, well, no other way to put it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=14.24s)]
*  He is a liar. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  He is not to be trusted ever. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=18.28s)]
*  We will explain and we have highlights of his most recent and frankly most egregious [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=20.62s)]
*  lies about the border, about his son. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=25.64s)]
*  Now he's blaming the nationwide crime wave that he created, of course, on Donald Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=28.48s)]
*  Also tonight, we got Biden, Obama, Clinton fundraising. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=34.56s)]
*  Where was Donald Trump? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=38.0s)]
*  He was visiting the wake of the slain NYPD officer. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=39.0s)]
*  We'll have reactions straight ahead. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=42.56s)]
*  Also Vivek Ramaswamy will join us with more on Joe's transgender day of visibility proclamation, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  which he denies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=51.88s)]
*  No, we actually have a copy of it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=52.88s)]
*  Laura Trump will be here to respond to a nasty, vicious, vile attack from the DNC. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=55.16s)]
*  And the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has a message for the president who just called [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=60.4s)]
*  him uninformed. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=65.64s)]
*  We'll see who is uninformed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=66.64s)]
*  But first, let's turn our attention to what is perhaps Joe Biden's most blatant lie of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=68.44s)]
*  all. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=74.32s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when millions of Americans were celebrating Easter, which is the holiest [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=75.32s)]
*  in all of Christianity, while the White House, they were busy promoting another celebration. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=80.72s)]
*  Frankly, one they kind of made up. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=85.8s)]
*  On Easter Sunday, self-proclaimed devout Catholic, your president, Joe Biden, posted that message [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=88.12s)]
*  right there, quote, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=94.6s)]
*  Today, on Transgender Day of Visibility, I have a simple message to all trans Americans. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  I see you, and you are made in the image of God, and you are worthy of respect and of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  dignity. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  Now, this celebratory message followed an official Biden White House proclamation, quote, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  I, Joseph R. Biden Jr. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=114.2s)]
*  By the way, not the alias he used to use in emails. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=117.04s)]
*  of America to hereby proclaim March 31, 2024, as Transgender Day of Visibility. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=121.64s)]
*  At 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Easter now has been replaced, or at least to the very least [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=130.44s)]
*  is now forced to share a day with a new holiday that the administration clearly prefers, Transgender [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=135.24s)]
*  Day of Visibility, on the holiest Christian holiday. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=142.32s)]
*  Now, the Trump campaign called the move appalling, blasphemous. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=145.72s)]
*  For other Americans, they were equally outraged. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  But when the president was harshly criticized for the move, well, he turned to his favorite [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=151.84s)]
*  tactic of all. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=156.48s)]
*  He just flat out lied. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=158.12s)]
*  When asked about his trans holiday proclamation, Biden told the press pool, quote, I didn't [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  do that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  Maybe he just didn't remember. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  In reality, Biden did do that in writing and then reminded everyone with a celebratory [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  post on X and other social media platforms, like the one right there on your screen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, the White House did avoid any posting of anything that day in its Spanish language [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  accounts and what appears to be, to some, a blatant attempt to hide the day from traditional [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  Catholic Hispanic voters where he's bleeding a lot of support. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, the, well, famous White House Easter egg roll, that had to wait until today, the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=194.64s)]
*  day after Easter. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=200.88s)]
*  Needless to say, any display of Christianity was all but banned from the Biden White House. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=202.64s)]
*  Even religious theme painted eggs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=207.76s)]
*  They were strictly prohibited. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=210.0s)]
*  You can't make this up. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=212.64s)]
*  You really can't. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=213.64s)]
*  This is simply hostility now towards religion. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=214.78s)]
*  And during his Easter speech, Biden mentioned Jesus, how many times? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=219.12s)]
*  Zero. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=224.0s)]
*  However, a very confused looking Joe did shuffle out onto the White House lawn for all the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=225.0s)]
*  festivities. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=230.2s)]
*  But for a president who famously goes to bed early and wakes up late, well, the early morning [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=231.2s)]
*  start time was quite difficult for Joe. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=236.12s)]
*  Hunter, on the other hand, looked pretty wide awake. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=238.76s)]
*  His father, the big guy, really could have borrowed some of that energy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=241.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=244.72s)]
*  You decide. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=245.72s)]
*  Enjoy the day. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=246.72s)]
*  And I'm coming down to do that Easter egg roll just a minute. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=247.72s)]
*  Thank you all so very, very much. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=251.56s)]
*  Thanks everybody. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=254.32s)]
*  And by the way, say hello to Oyster bunnies. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=255.32s)]
*  Come on up, bunnies. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=258.04s)]
*  Get up here so they can see you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=259.04s)]
*  Come on, get in there. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=261.0s)]
*  Pretty big bunny, huh? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=265.44s)]
*  The slurring, mumbling, bumbling confusion continued during a very friendly interview. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=266.44s)]
*  Oh, with that hard-hitting weatherman, Al Roker, on his favorite network, NBC News, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=272.28s)]
*  where only Democrats are allowed to appear. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=278.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=280.88s)]
*  What is so special about this egg roll? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=281.88s)]
*  Well, what's so special is just opening the—this is the people's house. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=283.84s)]
*  And I can expect over 40,000 people to be here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  It's the largest ever. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=290.84s)]
*  And just—we just like to open it up to the place and let people see this is their place. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=292.92s)]
*  And it always makes me feel good to look out there and see average Americans just walking [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=297.16s)]
*  around and looking at what's going on, because they own it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=302.04s)]
*  Now, that's the best Joe could do, despite zero tough questions from the Democratic operatives [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=305.6s)]
*  on NBC. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=310.72s)]
*  Now, of course, the president isn't just a habitual liar. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=311.72s)]
*  He is also utterly and completely incompetent. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  And as a result, Biden is losing support from both moderates and his radical pro-Hamas base. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  For example, by the way, the terrorist sympathizers, they were out in full force on Saturday. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  Take a look there on your screen. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=330.0s)]
*  They're interrupting the evening Easter mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=331.6s)]
*  ultimately even rushing the altar. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=337.16s)]
*  Here's the worst part. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=339.32000000000005s)]
*  Joe Biden is desperate for their vote. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=340.92s)]
*  Right on cue, he is rolling out his secret weapon, Vice President Harris, who is now [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  attempting to woo far-left voters with, let's see, calls for a ceasefire in Gaza and calls [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=347.88s)]
*  for elections to get rid of the prime minister and the promise of, oh, legalizing weed and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=353.88s)]
*  drugs and visiting abortion clinics. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=359.6s)]
*  This White House has drifted far and away from even the days of Bill Clinton. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  Remember, he once said about abortion, it should be legal and rare. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  But if Kamala's campaign is anything like her time as border czar, I don't think Republicans [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=371.56s)]
*  have much to worry about. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, another Biden strategy is name calling in an effort to beat Donald Trump. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  Biden is now trying to be more Trump-like, but his nicknames, yeah, they're pretty [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=382.8s)]
*  lame. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=387.12s)]
*  He's not a pro at this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=388.12s)]
*  For example, so-called broke Don made billions after truth social went public, another desperate [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=389.12s)]
*  Biden strategy for November. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=395.44000000000005s)]
*  They're bringing back Obamacare? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=398.44000000000005s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=400.56s)]
*  Where premiums have skyrocketed since Obamacare? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=401.56s)]
*  The cost of healthcare? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=405.0s)]
*  That's way up. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  Prescription drugs, they're more expensive. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=408.08s)]
*  Taxes are even higher. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=409.56s)]
*  And the promise, remember, you can keep your doctor, keep your plan, and the average family [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp42LQFY6g&t=411.28s)]
