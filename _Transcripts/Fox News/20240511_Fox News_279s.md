# Vivek Ramaswamy: No one takes Biden seriously
**Fox News:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk)
*  Today, Colombia and New York announced its university-wide graduation would, in fact, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=0.0s)]
*  be canceled after weeks of unrest. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=5.12s)]
*  Now, despite the disruptions, the chaos and the damage caused by these protests, well, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=7.48s)]
*  Michael Moore, part of the radical wing of what is the, quote, New Democratic Party, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  he's calling on students around the country to ramp up the intensity. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=18.56s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=22.44s)]
*  And when I'm talking about nonviolence, I'm talking aboutâ€”you do have the right [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=23.44s)]
*  to take over the administration building. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you, just speaking from Flint, we would have no UAW, no autoworkers union [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=30.32s)]
*  if back in the 30s, the autoworkers, including my uncle, had not taken over the factories. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=36.48s)]
*  They broke windows. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=44.12s)]
*  They locked all the doors. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=45.56s)]
*  They kept all the police and the National Guard out for 44 straight days in the middle [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=47.32s)]
*  of winter. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Yes, you have to take over buildings. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  That is not violence. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=55.94s)]
*  Oh, here with reaction, former 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=58.08s)]
*  Well, a lot of people on January 6th did nothing more than enter illegally, which they should [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=62.92s)]
*  not have done, the Capitol. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=69.44s)]
*  And that was all that they did. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=72.88s)]
*  And they're seeing long jail sentences. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=74.68s)]
*  We never punish the people responsible for the 574 riots in the summer of 2020, Vivek. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=77.16s)]
*  Your reaction to this call for insurrection, if you will? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=83.7s)]
*  And where's Liz Cheney? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=87.96s)]
*  Look, there's clearly two standards. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=88.96s)]
*  There's two standards of justice in this country, no doubt about it, Sean. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=91.52s)]
*  But especially as it relates to these campus protests, there's a really important point [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  to understand. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=98.32s)]
*  This is not a tyranny of the majority, even among students. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=99.66s)]
*  This is a tyranny of the fringe minority. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  And once we see that, we see an opportunity, actually, Sean. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=105.64s)]
*  Most students do not agree with these protests. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=108.64s)]
*  Look at many of these commencements where those protesters have been forcibly removed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=110.6s)]
*  You hear audiences erupting in cheering for the removal of those protesters. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=114.96s)]
*  So I think this is actually an opportunity for Republicans this year. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=119.88s)]
*  What we see is many young people who did not think of themselves necessarily as conservatives [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  are now being converted into being patriotic pro-American conservatives. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  So I actually think this is our opportunity, if we as Republicans have the courage to actually [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=132.06s)]
*  show up where a lot of these young people are. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=136.32s)]
*  There's an even bigger question, and that is, where is Joe Biden and real moral clarity? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=139.52s)]
*  I mean, because this was the worst terror attack in Israel's history. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=146.4s)]
*  You know, what part of the murder of 1,200 Israelis, the kidnapping of hundreds of innocent [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=149.68s)]
*  people, the murder, the beheading, the rapes, all that we know that took place? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=154.68s)]
*  And the president, we read, the administration won't comment on whether they have purposely [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=161.4s)]
*  delayed military aid to Israel because they didn't want what Israel is doing now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=166.44s)]
*  And that is for them to try and win the war against radical Islamic terrorism in Ra'afah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=173.44s)]
*  And they've been pressuring them from day one to show restraint in their war on terror. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=178.84s)]
*  Where's Joe Biden in this? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=185.36s)]
*  How does he, you know, what's the fallout for him in this? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=186.44s)]
*  Well, look, I think one of the philosophies for a long time in the American movement and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  the conservative movement has been peace through strength. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=195.08s)]
*  But what does that mean in one way? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=197.44000000000003s)]
*  It means just having a strong chief executive in the first place. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=199.44000000000003s)]
*  And if you look at global instability across the board, we are now on the cusp of major [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=203.12s)]
*  conflict in multiple parts of the world. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=207.36s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  We were in the same place when President Obama left office. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  Remember North Korea? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  So half of this is just having a commander in chief who actually has a spine, who actually [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=214.96s)]
*  is inspiring fear in foreign leaders around the world. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=219.08s)]
*  And I think that that's something we're missing today. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=222.46s)]
*  And the best foreign policy of all is to elect a new commander in chief. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=224.18s)]
*  That's why we need Donald Trump in office. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  And I think a lot of foreign policy isn't just the overall machinations of what strategy [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  we're pursuing where it's having a strong enough chief executive that actually other [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=235.38s)]
*  leaders around the world have to take seriously. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=239.66s)]
*  And the leader in the White House right now is absolutely somebody that no other leader [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=242.22s)]
*  around the world takes seriously today. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  That's our number one problem, Sean. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  And you know, scary times. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=250.46s)]
*  And meanwhile, Donald Trump is sidelined and Donald Trump is given a gag order and Donald [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=251.82s)]
*  Trump is being threatened with jail. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=256.46s)]
*  I don't think I ever imagined that our country would be descending this low at this time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=258.86s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=264.7s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, thank you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH04b82qZk&t=265.82s)]
