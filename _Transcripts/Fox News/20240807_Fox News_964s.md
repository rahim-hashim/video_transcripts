# Hannity: Kamala has only gone off-script once since her 'coronation’
**Fox News:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight the two most radical extreme well frankly dangerous far-left politicians ever [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=0.0s)]
*  Nominated by a major party are hiding in plain sight in front of friendly crowds as supporters [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=6.92s)]
*  And they're cheering crowds aren't as big as the leather you're letting you think [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, you got Harrison Walls reading their speeches from scripts likely that other people wrote they take zero questions [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=16.28s)]
*  There are no interviews. No press conferences. No town halls. No impromptu gaggles [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=23.48s)]
*  television hits no appearances not even on friendly venues like MSDNC [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=29.22s)]
*  Which is pretty much most of the media since her coronation Kamala has only gone off script one time for a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=34.7s)]
*  30-second word salad about the return of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=42.1s)]
*  American hostages was around 12 1 o'clock in the morning [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=45.46s)]
*  That's it then either Kamala nor Tim have been asked about their radical positions them in their own words the alleged [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  Subsequent flipping and flopping, but we don't even know for sure if they flipped and flopped because we only heard that from their campaign and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=56.58s)]
*  That was only after Harris was the presumptive Democratic nominee [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  That's called an election year conversion by every definition [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=68.08s)]
*  Now neither candidate has been asked about their radical past radical statements or their votes or their radical beliefs or policy positions [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=72.1s)]
*  These positions are not even on Kamala's website, which is pretty unprecedented [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=79.82s)]
*  Neither candidate has been asked to explain their track record. They've not been asked to defend radical statements [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=84.66s)]
*  They've made the state-run media mob. They don't seem to mind in fact [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=90.42s)]
*  They actually seem to prefer it all this way after all the media created their own adoring fantasy about the Democratic ticket and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=94.42s)]
*  They would hate for Kamala or Tim to get in the way of all that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=101.89999999999999s)]
*  Remember in 2007 and 8 I said journalism in America is dead and buried [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=106.02s)]
*  I had no idea how right I was take a look [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=111.46s)]
*  This is America's dad America's football coach [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=115.1s)]
*  America's all the coach wall. Yeah America's teacher [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=119.06s)]
*  And the teacher that's cool enough without trying to be cool. She was John Wayne last night [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=122.94s)]
*  She was a leader a leader and she was clear that she was the boss [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=128.22s)]
*  Walt's appears to fit the did all American definition of a man from middle middle America. He really has that perfect backstory [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=132.7s)]
*  He also has those rural roots. I sort of thought in my head, you know this guy [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=139.5s)]
*  He he really is kind of a rural American success story [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=143.62s)]
*  A lot of people have noticed the sort of down-to-earth [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=148.18s)]
*  Likeable quality to him a number of people that I have spoken to throughout this process [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  They have said that he is just a blast that he is fun to be with this ticket the vice president and the coach [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=156.10000000000002s)]
*  For those considering voting for the ticket giving them the power to think that they're [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  Participating in something that will put a smile on your face [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=167.86s)]
*  Look it's a non-stop love fest for Kamala Harris and and Tim walls the the biggest in-kind [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=173.18s)]
*  donation that any campaign would ever hope for and to think just a few months ago Kamala was considered a political pariah with the lowest [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=179.9s)]
*  Approval numbers ever for a vice president in American history all of a sudden [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=187.62s)]
*  She is now the second coming of Jesus [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=193.02s)]
*  I'm sure tomorrow the media is gonna be dutifully reporting she could walk on water cure cancer perform miracles [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=195.6s)]
*  What changed did the border crisis get solved? I didn't see it. Did the economy get better? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=203.2s)]
*  I didn't notice that inflation go away is there peace in the Middle East the Ukraine and Russia did that stop? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=207.95999999999998s)]

*  How's that Harris Biden economy? How's that working out for you? And what about your energy prices and electricity prices? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=227.52s)]
*  How's that working out? How about safety and security in your small town or big city wherever you happen to live is the world? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=234.32s)]
*  Overall a safer place war in Europe war in the Middle East and we're on pins and needles if Iran is about to bomb Israel [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=242.0s)]
*  Kamala and Tim are getting the white glove treatment [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=250.02s)]
*  Predictably from the state-run media mob simply because they are at the top of the Democratic ticket and they don't have the last name Trump [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=252.78s)]
*  So are there any actual journalists left NBC ABC CBS? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=260.66s)]

*  Is anyone demanding interviews? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=291.34s)]
*  Do you think that maybe the American people need to hear their radical positions in their own words? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=293.54s)]
*  Now if you want to be a full-time cheerleader for the Democratic Party, I am a thousand percent fine with that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=298.88s)]
*  I believe in freedom. I'm a freedom person unlike they say they are but they're not but don't call yourself a journalist [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=305.79999999999995s)]

*  They are really [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=323.88s)]
*  Radical supporting left-wing talk show hosts with a very clear agenda. I'm alright with that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=325.56s)]
*  I'm a member of the press [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=331.56s)]
*  I have the biggest talk radio show right now in the country and one of the top cable news shows in the country [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  I have thousands of hours of straight news that I can produce on radio and TV and prove it to you [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  I do investigative reporting like right now. We're vetting Kamala and Tim which the media refuses to do [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=344.64s)]
*  I give opinion. I am an outspoken conservative commentator. I am clear [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=350.62s)]
*  I am voting for Donald Trump and I'm supporting his candidacy. I don't lie. I don't hide it. I'm straight with my audience [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=355.94s)]
*  We also do culture and sports what we do [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=362.78s)]
*  In our role in the press is I'm like the entire newspaper start to finish cover to cover [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=366.26s)]
*  They claim to only do journalism [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  They are leftist talk show hosts talk show hosts like me [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=374.66s)]
*  Except they are radical left and they lie about who they are [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=379.14000000000004s)]
*  But of course lying and trickery isn't that part of the game? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=382.74s)]
*  They hide behind the mantle of journalism while doting on the Democrats ripping Donald Trump JD Vance [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=385.98s)]
*  Every single chance they get take a look [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=392.74s)]
*  Trump ain't ready for this. He's not this is so beyond his league [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=395.70000000000005s)]
*  He's not gonna be on a stage where he gets to walk up behind [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=400.66s)]
*  Kamala Harris and not have her turn around and damn near smack the hell out of him [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=405.06s)]
*  You can't be the strong man who's afraid to debate a woman Trump would fall flat on his face [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=410.3s)]
*  He just does not have to debate chops that are necessary to withstand all of the blows [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=414.1s)]
*  He would take from Kamala Harris. He is a wuss. He is scared of her [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=418.90000000000003s)]
*  She will run circles around him and he knows that doesn't she will destroy him frankly JD Vance [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=422.46000000000004s)]
*  Just dumb Vance is pretty weird [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=428.9s)]
*  I don't think Kamala Harris is gonna pick anyone as weird and creepy as JD Vance Claire [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  What do you make of the choice of JD Vance? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=437.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, it does not signal [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=439.26s)]
*  That he is Trump is trying to soften any edges and the only person who was more excited than JD Vance [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=442.74s)]
*  This afternoon was Vladimir Putin [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=448.98s)]
*  And [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=451.86s)]
*  Tonight even with a hostile press both Donald Trump and JD Vance routinely they speak with reporters just today [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=452.9s)]
*  JD Vance walked across the tarmac after landing right near Air Force to and he spoke with Kamala's very very [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=459.22s)]
*  Lonely press corps who have been totally ignored and shut out for weeks. Take a look. I [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=466.58s)]
*  figured I'd come by and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=472.62s)]
*  One get a good look at the plane because hopefully it's gonna be my plane in a few months [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=475.06s)]
*  But I also thought you guys might get lonely because the vice president doesn't answer questions from reporters and hasn't for 17 days [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=478.86s)]
*  Have they give you guys an explanation for why she won't take questions from reporters? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=486.54s)]
*  No [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=491.34s)]
*  Nobody, okay. Great. Well, I hope that she [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=493.26s)]
*  Changes her mind because it'd be good for the American people and I think it'd be good for you all [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=496.78s)]
*  She actually ran a real campaign instead of one from a basement with the teleprompter. So I've been with guys [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=500.14s)]
*  What would you like to hear from her? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=505.98s)]
*  Questions I've liberty just answer what she wants to do and also explain why every single position she has has changed [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=508.9s)]
*  Now the almost dead silent reporters they must have been in shock [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=517.14s)]
*  They couldn't believe that a vice presidential candidate was actually talking to them pretty shocking day for them [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=520.8199999999999s)]
*  The but it's really just pathetic though. They're doing this [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=527.74s)]
*  They are letting Democrats get away with it all just like Joe hiding in the basement during his [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=531.46s)]
*  2020 run history is now repeating itself journalism is dead in America. We have what is a dangerous [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=537.38s)]

*  Disinformation campaign about Joe and Hunter knowing that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=556.14s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani's attorney had a copy of the laptop that would likely be leaked and then it's leaked and they didn't verify the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=560.1800000000001s)]
*  Authenticity of it which they had done in March of 2020 now there is however an occasional moment of [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUg694fOf2w&t=567.1s)]
