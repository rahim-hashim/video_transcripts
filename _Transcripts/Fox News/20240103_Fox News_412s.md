# Alan Dershowitz responds to being named in Jeffrey Epstein court docs
**Fox News:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8)
*  Joining us now, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=0.0s)]
*  Professor, you are mentioned in this document. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=3.6s)]
*  You are mentioned repeatedly and very specifically. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=6.68s)]
*  It was the allegation against you was that Epstein forced [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  then minor Jane Doe number three [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  to have sexual relations with you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=18.96s)]
*  And that also you were an eyewitness to sexual abuse [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=21.16s)]
*  of other minors by Epstein. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=24.2s)]
*  You have been out there vigorously defending your name, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=27.28s)]
*  your honor and denying these allegations fiercely. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=32.24s)]
*  And I wanna give you a chance now that it's come out [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=35.88s)]
*  in writing tonight to get your reaction. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=37.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, the woman who accused me [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=41.68s)]
*  has now stated categorically [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=43.4s)]
*  that she may have misidentified me, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=45.68s)]
*  confused me with someone else. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=47.32s)]
*  And these documents, if all the documents are revealed, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=49.28s)]
*  will prove categorically [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=52.96s)]
*  that she did misidentify me, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=54.9s)]
*  that I never met her, never heard of her, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=57.18s)]
*  never spoke to her. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=58.82s)]
*  And I can prove it by independent means. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=61.1s)]
*  I have all my travel records. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=63.22s)]
*  I have all my television appearances. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=64.9s)]
*  I can prove that I couldn't possibly have been anywhere [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=68.18s)]
*  near any of the people who were involved in this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=71.9s)]
*  I was Epstein's lawyer. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=75.58s)]
*  Of course I flew on his plane with Ken Starr, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=76.78s)]
*  with Roy Black, with other lawyers. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=79.58s)]
*  We flew to meetings with the US attorney, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=83.14s)]
*  with the state attorney. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=85.86s)]
*  And so people have to be very careful [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=88.38s)]
*  about what they're believing and when it happened. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=91.02s)]
*  For example, as soon as Epstein was shown to be what he was, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=95.5s)]
*  I ended my personal association with him completely, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=101.34s)]
*  but I maintained a legal relationship with him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=104.34s)]
*  I represented some of the worst people in the world [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=106.9s)]
*  and continue to do so. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=109.22s)]
*  That's my life. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=110.74000000000001s)]
*  And of course I represented Epstein. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=111.9s)]
*  Now, the one point I do want to make is that I understand [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=114.06s)]
*  all the feminist groups and the radicals [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  and think this is the worst thing in the world [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=120.14s)]
*  that anybody ever had any contact with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=122.18s)]
*  Where are all those radical feminists [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=124.98s)]
*  when it comes to the Hamas rapes of young Jewish girls, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=128.1s)]
*  sexual abuse, beheadings? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=132.74s)]
*  They are quiet. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=135.1s)]
*  They are silent. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=136.22s)]
*  The incredible hypocrisy of the Me Too movement. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=137.5s)]
*  Me Too, except if you're a Jew. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=140.42s)]
*  And I want to have a list of all the radical feminists [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=143.74s)]
*  who are pushing hard. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=147.01999999999998s)]
*  And I understand that to get all these names revealed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=148.34s)]
*  And I want to know how many of them [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=151.14s)]
*  have ever actually condemned Hamas [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=153.5s)]
*  for the rapes that we now know occurred [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=155.82s)]
*  and the murders that occurred. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  How many have been silent? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  And how many like the National Lawyers Guild [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  have actually approved of what Hamas did? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=163.3s)]
*  So let's put this in context. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=166.18s)]
*  I'm thrilled that all these papers have come out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=168.74s)]
*  I urged them, I went to court, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=171.02s)]
*  I asked for everything to come out [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=172.66s)]
*  because I knew that I had done nothing wrong [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=174.06s)]
*  and the papers would exculpate me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=176.46s)]
*  What I only worry about is that maybe the judges [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=178.82000000000002s)]
*  withheld certain documents. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=181.3s)]
*  I want to make sure every single document comes out, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=182.9s)]
*  including the documents that cast doubt on the credibility [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=185.94s)]
*  of some of the accusers and some of the accused. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  The public has the right to see everything [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=192.06s)]
*  and make their own judgment. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=194.9s)]
*  We do not put the country at guilt by accusation [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=196.14s)]
*  but guilt by association. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=199.06s)]
*  Well, by the way, I think that is fair. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=201.14s)]
*  And I still, like you, believe [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=202.54s)]
*  that in the presumption of innocence [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=204.06s)]
*  and I don't rush the judgment. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=205.7s)]
*  And frankly, on many high profile cases in this country, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=207.26s)]
*  this show, starting with Richard Jewell, we've been right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  We were right about Duke Lacrosse. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=214.06s)]
*  We were right about UVA. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=215.62s)]
*  We were right about Ferguson, Missouri [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=217.7s)]
*  and Freddie Gray and Baltimore [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=219.7s)]
*  because I didn't rush to judgment [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=220.98s)]
*  and I had impeccable sources. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=222.74s)]
*  I have known you for years. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=225.54s)]
*  I don't really know why you like to defend [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  these high profile clients. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=232.62s)]
*  Everybody certainly deserves a defense, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  including Mr. Epstein, including OJ Simpson. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=236.01999999999998s)]
*  And you and I had wars over Bill Clinton back in the day. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=238.62s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=242.89999999999998s)]
*  You've taken on these high profile cases. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  Why and do you regret it at all? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=246.5s)]
*  And did you ever see anything untoward about Mr. Epstein? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=248.42s)]
*  I never did. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=252.78s)]
*  And I do regret having ever met Jeffrey Epstein [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=253.7s)]
*  because it caused me the worst few years of my life [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=256.38s)]
*  when I was falsely accused [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=260.46s)]
*  and I was canceled by the 92nd Street Y, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=262.74s)]
*  canceled by Temple Emanuel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=266.02s)]
*  And then she ultimately admitted [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=267.98s)]
*  that she may have confused me with someone else. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  And so, you know, things obviously have gotten a lot better. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=273.06s)]
*  Now, of course, these revelations [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=276.46s)]
*  put my name in the headlines again, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=278.82s)]
*  but I've never been afraid of that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=280.3s)]
*  because I have nothing to be afraid of, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=281.78s)]
*  nothing to be ashamed of. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=283.85999999999996s)]
*  I did nothing wrong. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=284.94s)]
*  Would I do it again? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=286.82s)]
*  Not if I knew I was gonna be falsely accused, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=287.82s)]
*  but if not for that, I've represented far worse people. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=290.41999999999996s)]
*  I've represented murderers. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  I've represented people who have done [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  terrible, terrible things. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=297.46s)]
*  That's an essential part of our system. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=298.82s)]
*  If I don't do it, who will? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  I had tenure. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  I had an obligation to defend the most controversial, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=303.58s)]
*  the worst people. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=307.73999999999995s)]
*  Sometimes I won, sometimes I lost. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=309.02s)]
*  Sometimes I created a plea bargain, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=311.1s)]
*  like I did in this case, by the way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=312.74s)]
*  Epstein was furious at me for the plea bargain. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  He wouldn't pay my fee [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=316.42s)]
*  because he thought I had done a terrible job [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=317.74s)]
*  because he ended up going to jail [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=319.26000000000005s)]
*  and having to report as a sex offender. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=320.94s)]
*  The rest of the world thought it was a sweetheart. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=323.18s)]
*  But that's what criminal defense lawyers do. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=325.62s)]
*  I'm 85 years old. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=328.1s)]
*  I hope the good Lord gives me the strength [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  to continue to represent the most despised, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  the most controversial, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  the most unpopular people in the world. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=335.3s)]
*  Look at the hell I got for representing Donald Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  I did that and I lost a lot of my friends [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=340.06s)]
*  and people say to me all the time, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=342.41999999999996s)]
*  oh, I understand Epstein, but not Trump, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=343.82s)]
*  or I understand Trump, but not Epstein. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=345.58s)]
*  You have to understand that the role [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=347.5s)]
*  of the criminal defense lawyer [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=349.14s)]
*  is to defend everybody who's falsely accused. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=350.46s)]
*  I'll say this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=353.02s)]
*  Is there even truthfully accused? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=354.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=356.38s)]
*  I think you're gonna be the only one [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=357.82s)]
*  that does have the courage to say, no, it's not true. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=359.74s)]
*  And you do make a good point. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=362.26s)]
*  If there's exculpatory information [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  that is not released as part of the information [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=366.02s)]
*  that is being given out by the judge, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  I think that's unfair to everybody [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=370.70000000000005s)]
*  and that would be unfair to you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=372.38s)]
*  And if you believe it's exculpatory, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=374.38s)]
*  I think the public should see that as well. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=377.18s)]
*  Professor, thank you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=379.86s)]
*  I don't need any more exculpatory material [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=381.86s)]
*  because the woman has already admitted [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=383.82s)]
*  that she may have clearly misidentified me [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  and that's enough for me. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=388.74s)]
*  I'm going on with my life. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=389.86s)]
*  I'm gonna continue to do what I've been doing for years. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=391.22s)]
*  But thank you, Sean, for an opportunity to present my case. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  Professor, we appreciate your time as always. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=397.74s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUESiGbXq8&t=399.5s)]
