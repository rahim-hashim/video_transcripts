# Hannity: Is this the hill Democrats want to die on?
**Fox News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4)
*  First, I want to kind of take a moment here to reflect on all that's happening in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=0.0s)]
*  country, the Washington swamp. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=5.12s)]
*  You know, for the first time in decades, real common sense sanity is returning to our government. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  But don't expect the extreme radical left, the Democrats, the state-run legacy media [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=13.88s)]
*  mob, to ever appreciate anything Donald Trump ever does. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=18.16s)]
*  He cured cancer tomorrow. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  They would still call him Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and a racist. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=24.82s)]
*  And now they extend that same warm welcome and courtesy to Elon Musk. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=28.68s)]
*  Look, I don't usually agree with John Stewart. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=32.64s)]
*  Nor does he agree with me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=35.08s)]
*  I don't think he likes me, but I don't care. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=36.6s)]
*  At least Stewart has enough intellectual honesty in him to realize the Democratic Party, they [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=39.72s)]
*  have lost the plot. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=46.44s)]
*  Hook, line, sink or gone. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=47.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  I'm very big on, and I know it's annoying, but specificity and nuance. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=50.8s)]
*  I think if you cry fascism at every administrative overreach, even the ones that are constitutionally [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  okay, you will find yourself out of fascism bullets when the time really comes to remind [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  people of... [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=73.44s)]
*  Because you will... [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=74.44s)]
*  I think what the media has done over the last 10 years is cry wolf to the point where they [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=76.52s)]
*  numbed everybody. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=83.08s)]
*  It was an anesthetic. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=84.16s)]
*  It's dead on accurate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  Can't argue with that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=88.08s)]
*  Democrats who cried wolf are not doing themselves any favors. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=89.36s)]
*  Look, I argue maybe Fetterman is the only example. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=92.56s)]
*  I argue almost the entire Democratic Party has become this woke, re-New Deal extreme [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=95.56s)]
*  ideologues. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=101.24s)]
*  In fact, look at this, new Quinnipiac poll, congressional Democrats are at their lowest [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=102.24s)]
*  approval rating in history at 22%. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=106.84s)]
*  And meanwhile, a majority of Americans trust Donald Trump and Elon Musk to rein in our [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=110.64s)]
*  federal government. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=115.8s)]
*  Trump has been regularly polling in the mid-50s. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=117.0s)]
*  Rasmussen this week had Musk at an approval rating of 55%. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=119.28s)]
*  And all for good reason. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  In the course of meeting Elon Musk, I have talked to him on the phone, never met him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=125.88s)]
*  It's not his money that impresses me, although it's pretty impressive, right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  It's his incredible intellect, love of life, hard work ethic, incredible brilliant brainpower, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=135.0s)]
*  accomplishments that any objective, clear-thinking person with common sense would be impressed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=142.8s)]
*  with. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=149.32000000000002s)]
*  This is a guy who's done incredible things for our country, for humanity. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, think about what he's accomplished in his life, PayPal, Tesla. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  You'd think liberals would love Tesla. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  Now they're mad at Tesla. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=158.28s)]
*  Starlink, he's got robotics. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=160.0s)]
*  Starlink makes satellites available, communications available in over 100 countries. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=162.04s)]
*  He was the chief engineer at SpaceX. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=167.04s)]
*  You've got to be pretty smart to do that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=168.92s)]
*  This is the first company to launch astronauts into orbit. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  First private company. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=174.66s)]
*  It is a dreams of going to Mars and so much more. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=175.66s)]
*  In fact, Musk is sending SpaceX to rescue the American astronauts that are now stranded [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=179.64s)]
*  on the International Space Station. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=186.14s)]
*  They're only supposed to be there eight days, they're there over nearly 300. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=187.6s)]
*  He also founded Neuralink. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=192.28s)]
*  This blows me away. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=193.28s)]
*  And a revolutionary company working in part to use AI to end blindness. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  And he's quick to help our fellow Americans in need, you know, like the people of North [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=200.28s)]
*  Carolina that had no communications. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=204.76s)]
*  He sent Starlink over immediately, did the same after the California wildfires. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  So you've got to ask yourself, and why? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=210.6s)]
*  Why all this hatred? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=214.76s)]
*  Why the rage from the left? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=216.38s)]
*  Well, first, the obvious, he's working with Donald Trump. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=218.0s)]
*  They hate the site, name, mention of Donald Trump. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=221.72s)]
*  They get triggered. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=223.96s)]
*  His, and number two, and they should really be embarrassed by themselves over this, because [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=224.96s)]
*  we played for you the other night. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=232.04s)]
*  We played, let's see, Al Gore, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=233.24s)]
*  You know, Washington has been talking about and giving lip service to eliminating waste, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=237.32s)]
*  fraud and abuse and corruption now for decades and decades. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=243.0s)]
*  And let's look at your screen. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=247.44s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  Look at this waste. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, what, this is what Doge and Elon Musk have uncovered so far. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  Billions in wasteful, horrific spending. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  Steve Miller was on Fake News CNN and asking, why are you not celebrating this accountability? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=261.36s)]
*  Kind of epic. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=268.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=269.44s)]
*  This president, for the first time in history, is committed to restoring accountability [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=270.44s)]
*  at every level of the federal government. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  You may assert there's no waste in the Pentagon. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=280.12s)]
*  You may assert there's no waste in Treasury. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=281.68s)]
*  You may assert there's no waste in HHS. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=283.68s)]
*  I don't think anyone would assert that, Stephen. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=285.68s)]
*  Stephen, I don't think anyone would. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=286.68s)]
*  Then why are you not celebrating these cuts? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  If you agree there is waste, if you agree there is abuse, if you agree there is corruption, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  why are you not celebrating the cuts, the reforms that are being instituted every day [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=294.88000000000005s)]
*  that no action is taken? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  The entire salaries of American workers that are taxed disappear forever. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  Now, I spent years of my early adult life living paycheck to paycheck, years and years. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=306.84s)]
*  Wasn't fun. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=311.44s)]
*  Keep in mind, the average American makes $66 grand a year. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=312.44s)]
*  We have over $37 trillion in debt. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=315.48s)]
*  That is not sustainable. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=318.56s)]
*  Now, smearing, slandering, you know, this American that is working for free to fix it [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=319.92s)]
*  is—if this is the hill that Democrats want to die on and rob our children and our grandchildren [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=326.48s)]
*  of their future using your hard-earned tax dollars to pay for DEI musicals, transgender [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=333.79999999999995s)]
*  surgeries, LGBTQ, and wasting billions upon billions with shady left-wing NGOs and the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=340.08s)]
*  radical Green New Deal, have at it, if that's what you represent. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=346.84s)]
*  The Democratic Party, this extreme, would never win another election. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=350.84s)]
*  But what worries me is that if the left keeps treating people like this, F. Donald Trump, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=355.08s)]
*  you know, and the ridiculous, predictable singing and screaming and slogans, you know, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  they've been chanting since the 1960s, they're like in a time warp, ask yourself, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=366.36s)]
*  how many Americans in the future that are this successful are ever going to want to sacrifice [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=371.8s)]
*  massive amounts of money and want to serve their country? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=376.68s)]
*  And look at after all they have done to Donald Trump and all they said about him. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=380.36s)]
*  John Stewart nailed it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=385.32s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=386.52s)]
*  Democracy won. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=387.32s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=388.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, democracy kind of lost the battle then by the American people. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  And they spoke loudly. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  And all this noise, you know, has rendered the legacy state-run media mob irrelevant [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  because they don't tell the truth. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  And they just, you know, they bubble and fizz like alga salts or water at the very site of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=403.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=408.12s)]
*  You know, who's strong enough and willing to put everything on the line for service to their [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=409.32s)]
*  country? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=416.28s)]
*  Now, we're kind of lucky and thankful. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=416.76s)]
*  I'm a conservative. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=419.08s)]
*  You can disagree with me politically. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=419.88s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=421.32s)]
*  You know, but Donald Trump, Elon Musk are now sacrificing a lot. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=422.44s)]
*  Trump risked it all. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=427.47999999999996s)]
*  They're sacrificing for the good of the country because this that kind of spending is [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=429.0s)]
*  unconscionable, should shock the conscience and the soul of a nation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  But after this latest wave of smears, you know, I'm sick of the oh so pious Democrats. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=437.88s)]
*  They always have a monopoly on compassion and a love of science and progress and innovation. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=444.04s)]
*  Did I forget to mention that Elon has a robot company that will take care of menial tasks? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  And probably by the time it'll when they go into mass production, maybe most of the middle class in [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=457.16s)]
*  this country will be able to afford it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=463.16s)]
*  All while ruthlessly, they just want to tear down one of the great innovators in American [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=465.24s)]
*  history, the Democratic Party. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  They've just completely lost their way tonight. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=472.36s)]
*  Honestly, I'm going to be frank. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=474.6s)]
*  I'm grateful that they graciously, meaning Donald Trump, President Trump and Elon Musk, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=477.0s)]
*  answered my questions about conflicts of interest. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=483.72s)]
*  You know, the stupid question. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=486.6s)]
*  I had to ask it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  I'd get slaughtered by the media. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=489.24s)]
*  Who's in charge? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=491.64s)]
*  That was not an easy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=492.76s)]
*  I was not a hard answer to figure out. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=494.2s)]
*  They know who's in charge. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=496.76s)]
*  And they can't stop obsessing over Donald Trump. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=498.44s)]
*  Now they can't stop obsessing and hating on Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=502.12s)]
*  And they even were—I had no idea going into this interview. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm grateful. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=510.04s)]
*  I had no idea how long this interview would be. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=511.4s)]
*  They allowed me to spend more than an hour speaking with them at the White House. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=513.16s)]
*  And then more time behind the scenes. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=518.2s)]
*  I had no idea going in, you know, how long I had with them when we started. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=520.6s)]
*  I'm lucky they did stay long, as long as they did. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQZWbzpYP4&t=525.08s)]
