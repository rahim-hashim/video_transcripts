# Mike Huckabee: Trump is the best hope we have
**Fox News:** [February 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg)
*  reaction, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer. Good to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=0.0s)]
*  see you both, Governor Huckabee. I mean, I think everything that we could possibly say about Joe [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=5.2s)]
*  Biden has been said. But when you see this and it is—look, whatever cognitive issues he has, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=10.24s)]
*  it is degenerative. It never gets better. It only gets worse. It seems to—the getting worse part [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=18.8s)]
*  seems to have accelerated in recent months. Would you agree with that? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  It would be hard not to agree with that. I'm just sitting here watching, thinking, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=31.6s)]
*  man, I sure picked the wrong year not to run for president. I should have gone ahead and done it [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=35.44s)]
*  now. You know, this is really disturbing. So you're saying confidently you would have [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  beaten Donald Trump? I know you like Trump. You're telling Donald Trump on national TV tonight [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  you'd beat him? Nah, no, no way. I'm supporting him and have been since he announced for [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=51.36s)]
*  reelection and supported him in 2016. He's really the best hope we have to get this country back on [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=57.12s)]
*  track, secure the border, make it so that people can afford their bacon, butter and bread, which [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=62.72s)]
*  they can't do right now for the most part, unless they have Joe Biden's salary, which most Americans [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=68.48s)]
*  don't. This is a tragedy, and the tragedy is, is that Democrats and the media keep covering for him. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=73.68s)]
*  And I think the more that the American people see what you just showed, they're going to look [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=80.08s)]
*  at this and those numbers with blacks, Hispanics and young people are only going to continue to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=85.44s)]
*  crater for Joe Biden. People look at this and they say, I don't care whether I like this guy, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=90.88s)]
*  can't even say if I like his policies, which I can't imagine they would. But this man is not [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=95.84s)]
*  capable of leading the country. I think of watching a scene from The Sixth Sense and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=101.52s)]
*  Haley Joel Osment and he looks around and he says, I see dead people. That's who he sees. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=107.12s)]
*  He sees Mitterrand instead of seeing Macron. I mean, this is bizarre stuff. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=112.64s)]
*  Well, I agree with every bit of it. I think maybe what is even more interesting is his vice president, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=119.36s)]
*  vice president Harris, Ari Fleischer, her approval ratings lower than his. How's that possible? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=126.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's really an accomplishment, isn't it? And if I'm Donald Trump, I will remind everybody [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=132.48s)]
*  that it's highly likely that Kamala Harris will be the president of the United States if Joe Biden [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  somehow is able to win the election. That will scare a lot of people. But I want to go to this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=143.6s)]
*  issue, Sean, because it's so much worse than him not remembering the name of Hamas. If you had [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=148.16s)]
*  actually begun that tape about 10 seconds earlier, what you would have witnessed was the United [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=153.76s)]
*  States president struggling to recall the briefing he got about the status of negotiations between [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=158.0s)]
*  Israel and Hamas. He could not remember the details. You saw the wheels turning in his head, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=164.0s)]
*  the cobwebs trying to be swept out of the way. He couldn't remember it. He was struggling. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=170.08s)]
*  Same thing happened, Sean, in the lead up to the Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=176.0s)]
*  He said that nobody in the military told him he could have left a smaller number of troops in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=179.68s)]
*  Afghanistan and therefore maybe save those lives of the 13 Marines. He said nobody told him that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=184.08s)]
*  was an option. And then he was contradicted by his own military saying no, he was briefed about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  that. This is what happens when a president cannot recall his briefings. It's deadly serious. It's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  not just he didn't remember the name of Hamas. He doesn't remember the things he's told earlier, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=200.96s)]
*  hours earlier, in the Oval Office. That puts all Americans in danger. That's the problem with a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=206.72000000000003s)]
*  president that age. All right. So I'll throw it to you, Ari, first. We're 271 days away from Election [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=212.56s)]
*  Day. All right. Does he survive till that point? Do you buy into any of these? I would argue that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=220.0s)]
*  they're just educated guesses of people, that the Democrats maybe at the convention will look to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=227.28s)]
*  somebody else to take his place. Do you believe that or does he survive? Well, first, if Huckabee [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=233.2s)]
*  throws his hat in the ring, nobody stands a chance. That's just obvious. There might be [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=239.68s)]
*  there might be rumors that there might be a Huckabee on the ticket, though, Ari. It might not be the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=244.72s)]
*  one on the show, but there is rumors about that. I didn't say it would be the good Huckabee or the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=250.0s)]
*  very good Huckabee. Here's the thing about Biden and the Democratic convention. If he continues to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=256.4s)]
*  lose in the polls to Donald Trump, the Democrats, especially the super delegates going to that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=265.2s)]
*  August convention, are going to be in panic. They don't love Joe Biden. But what they do do is hate [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=269.76s)]
*  Donald Trump. So if there is a likelihood that Joe Biden would lose to Donald Trump, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=277.12s)]
*  there will be a panic and they're going to have to look for somebody else. I give that about a one [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  in three odds that that'll happen. But I also want to say, Sean, I think in October, those groups that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=286.08s)]
*  you showed that are losing faith, losing support for Joe Biden right now, they're going to come [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=290.96s)]
*  home. Republicans should not fool themselves into thinking that they're going to do fantastically [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=295.52s)]
*  better with blacks, Hispanics or younger people. They're sending signals right now that they're [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=300.0s)]
*  very distressed with Biden. I think Donald Trump is going to do better with blacks, Hispanics and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  young people, but not that well. Those groups are largely going to come home in October. It'll be a [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  close election. Historically, that's exactly what has happened. I think Republicans have gotten their [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=315.12s)]
*  hopes up. I'm hoping one day that that certain, you know, identity groups, if you want to call [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=320.72s)]
*  them, that they get the message that maybe this party that comes every two and four years and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=327.68s)]
*  makes promises is not doing a good job for them. All right. How does this play out, Governor Huckabee? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=332.48s)]
*  I think there's a better chance that we will keep some of those voters among blacks, Hispanics and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=339.04s)]
*  young people. I agree with Ari. It's not going to be the magnificent numbers, but some of them [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=343.44000000000005s)]
*  will just stay home. They're not going to go vote for Joe. They may not vote for Trump, but they won't [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=348.32s)]
*  vote for Joe. But I'll tell you what I'm watching. I'm watching mothers of four children in Boston [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=352.32s)]
*  who are angry because her kids can't go to the community center and play basketball because it's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=358.56s)]
*  filled up with illegal immigrants. They're getting gift cards. She's getting shown the door. And you [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=364.0s)]
*  keep doing that through November. And a lot of those folks, out of sheer anger and frustration, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=369.28s)]
*  they'll vote for Donald Trump and say it can't be worse. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=374.4s)]
*  You know, the fascinating thing is, is them trying to put this on the Republicans. And everybody knows [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=378.08s)]
*  this was policy from day one of Joe Biden. That little game has not been successful, even with [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  the help of pretty much the entire media mob running interference and being an extension of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=390.56s)]
*  the Biden campaign press office. Anyway, appreciate you both. Ari Fleischer, thank you. Governor, thank you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuOqyCk6Yg&t=395.92s)]
