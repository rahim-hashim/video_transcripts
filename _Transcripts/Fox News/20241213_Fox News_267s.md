# Biden is either incompetent or lying about this: Sen. Rick Scott
**Fox News:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE)
*  Senator Rick Scott, our friend, my senator in the free state of Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Scott, try and explain this to me, because they lied to us about the Chinese [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=4.16s)]
*  spy balloon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=10.0s)]
*  You're—are they trying to tell us that the most powerful country on the face of this [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=11.0s)]
*  Earth, that the United States is incapable of determining whether or not this is a drone [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=16.22s)]
*  or not a drone, they can't confirm it's a drone? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=23.7s)]
*  How were they not able to give a definitive answer at this late date, nearly a month after? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=27.9s)]
*  Well, look, the bottom line is they're either incompetent or they're lying. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=33.62s)]
*  But here's what we do know. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  The American public has no trust, whether it's under Biden's DOJ, FBI, DOD. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  There is no trust in the federal government right now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=49.84s)]
*  I mean, I—look, we—they don't trust—I just got through the campaign trail. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=53.94s)]
*  I asked people, do you think they're going to disclose what happened at the Butler shooting [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=58.18s)]
*  of President Trump? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=62.7s)]
*  Not one person in the state of Florida says, FBI is going to tell us, DOJ is going to tell [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  us, Secret Service is going to tell us. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=69.14s)]
*  So, we've lost complete trust in the federal government. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=71.1s)]
*  So people are concerned. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=74.02s)]
*  But wait a minute, but in fairness— [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=75.02s)]
*  They don't understand why we wouldn't know. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=76.02s)]
*  But in fairness, they said that there was a sloped roof in Butler, PA, except the problem [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=79.6s)]
*  is there was no pitch to the roof, and they flat-out lied to us, again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=84.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=89.0s)]
*  I mean, it just—it makes no sense. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=90.0s)]
*  Now, I've got legislation passed that says there's not going to be any Chinese drones [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  bought by your federal government. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=96.72s)]
*  First they did for all the military, then the whole government. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=98.44s)]
*  Now there's not—will be no new licenses of Chinese drones. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=100.96s)]
*  But this is a federal—this is under Biden. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  It's like they don't care. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=106.56s)]
*  I mean, it's just like they just think we're all a bunch of idiots. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=109.56s)]
*  We have pictures. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  We, you know, we have pictures. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  We're showing them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  And they can't figure this out? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=117.08s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=118.54s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=120.64s)]
*  So, the most powerful country on earth, we saw during the campaign, we saw the Trump [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=121.64s)]
*  campaign was hacked. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Their emails, their phones were hacked by both China and Iran during the campaign. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=128.74s)]
*  We had a Chinese spy balloon. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=135.9s)]
*  Now we have unidentified objects flying all over the place that are visually being seen [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  by people in New Jersey. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't think the people in New Jersey are lying. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=144.56s)]
*  I think the government is lying. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=147.0s)]
*  They lied about the spy balloons. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  They lied about a secure border. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  They lied about inflation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=151.48s)]
*  They lied about Joe's cognitive state. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=152.98s)]
*  And I can keep going with all the lies that they told. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=155.06s)]
*  They said that Donald Trump was a Nazi, a fascist, a racist. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=157.62s)]
*  The lies didn't go over well with the American people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=161.56s)]
*  Donald Trump won. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=164.0s)]
*  They lied about the American people that support Donald Trump. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=165.36s)]
*  They call people like me garbage, irredeemable, deplorables. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  And I'm a bitter American that clings to my God. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  I do. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  Guns, Bible, my religion. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  All guilty. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=178.52s)]
*  So, they do an awful lot of lying. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=179.52s)]
*  And they don't seem to ever be held accountable. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=182.8s)]
*  Yeah, but here's what's going to happen. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=185.4s)]
*  We are going to get Trump's nominees through quickly. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=189.28000000000003s)]
*  January 20th, the American public is going to start trusting their federal government [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=192.52s)]
*  again with Pam Bondi as attorney general, Marco Rubio as secretary of state, Donald [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=196.96s)]
*  Trump as president, Cash Patel running an FBI. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=201.0s)]
*  So we're going to start trusting our federal government again because they're going to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  be transparent, they're going to be honest, they're going to be ethical. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=207.44s)]
*  That's the complete change from the Biden era. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=211.36s)]
*  I mean, you look at—does anybody trust what comes out of Mallorca's mouth or Christopher [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=213.8s)]
*  Ray's mouth or Merrick Garland's mouth? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  None of it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=220.08s)]
*  We don't trust anything they say. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=221.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=223.24s)]
*  Well, I am grateful. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=224.24s)]
*  You are my senator. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=226.0s)]
*  I've got a full year now under my belt in the free state of Florida. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=227.28s)]
*  And homesteaded, domiciled, voted in Florida, got to vote for you, and it was a good feeling. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=231.4s)]
*  Chuck Schumer never took my call. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  Yep, thanks for your vote. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=239.4s)]
*  Neither did Gillibrand, neither did Hogle, neither did Cuomo. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=240.4s)]
*  Nobody likes me in New York. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=245.12s)]
*  And they—you know, two governors in a row said, if you're a conservative, get the hell [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=246.64s)]
*  out of town. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=250.16s)]
*  Get on a bus, go down to Florida. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=251.16s)]
*  So I came. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=252.16s)]
*  Anyway, Senator, thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh4-xl5fXTE&t=253.16s)]
