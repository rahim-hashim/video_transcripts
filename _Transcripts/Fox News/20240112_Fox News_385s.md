# I’m proud of my record: Ron DeSantis
**Fox News:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A)
*  Here with reaction 2024 Republican presidential candidate and now my governor. I know you stuck [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=0.0s)]
*  with me. This is really, that's, I'm sure this is painful for you. Governor Rhonda Sanderson is here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=6.16s)]
*  Well, you know, Sean, the thing about it is, is us Floridians usually don't go north in January. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=10.88s)]
*  Here I am in Iowa. It's now single digits. There's going to be a big snow storm coming [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  through tonight and tomorrow. By caucus night, they think it could be negative 20 degrees [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=23.76s)]
*  with wind chill even less than that. And yeah, I was down in Florida at the beginning of the week [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=29.68s)]
*  for the state of the state address. When I flew up to Iowa, actually I do own a winter code in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=33.92s)]
*  Florida. I haven't worn it a while, but I left it there. So we're getting my stuff. I'm going to be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=38.88s)]
*  ready to go. But we've got a lot of great supporters that are, I gave away all my winter clothes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=43.36s)]
*  They're gone. I gave it away. I wasn't planning on 20 below weather and I'll be there with you on [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Monday. All right. Let's talk about, from your perspective, the state of the race. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=54.96s)]
*  How important is Iowa to you? I always find Iowa, a caucus system could be a little funky, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=59.52s)]
*  New Hampshire allowing independents to decide, you know, what party primary they want to vote for. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=66.8s)]
*  That makes, that kind of puts a twist into things. Your reaction to both of those and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=71.6s)]
*  then heading into South Carolina. Well, last night was a great night for us. I think that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=76.32s)]
*  Nikki Haley was clearly flustered and rattled because she's uncomfortable being confronted [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=83.12s)]
*  with a record. I'm proud of my record in Florida, of beating the left, of delivering on my promises. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=88.0s)]
*  And I'm proud of the vision we have for this country. So when that debate ended, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=93.92s)]
*  we had people go into rondesandes.com, signing up to help more people been going to the website [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=97.12s)]
*  to donate. So that's, that's a great sign for us. But here's the thing, Sean, you're exactly right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  A caucus is just different than a typical election because it's about organization. It's about turning [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  your people out. We've built an incredible organization. I've gone to all 99 counties. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=112.48s)]
*  I've answered questions from Iowans all across the state. That is not necessarily what coastal [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=117.44s)]
*  media likes to see. They think you're spending too much time listening to people. I disagree with [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=123.04s)]
*  that, that it does pay off on caucus night. Now with this weather, I think the organization is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=127.92s)]
*  going to matter even more because going out in negative 20 degrees, unless you're really [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=132.72s)]
*  committed to voting, that's an easy reason why you wouldn't want to go. So we've got that in place. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=138.16s)]
*  We're continuing to gather more folks. I've done a number of events today. Sean, people are coming [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=143.6s)]
*  out in big numbers, even in the weather. We're going to do an event right after this. I got a big [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=147.84s)]
*  crowd right now here in the Des Moines area. So people are definitely getting excited about this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=151.84s)]
*  race. We've seen energy on the ground, but Monday, the story is organization, organization, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=157.2s)]
*  organization. I think we've done it right. And I'm looking forward to being able to take that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  through. I'm looking forward to it, but I'm not looking forward to the 20 degree below zero [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=167.76s)]
*  weather that I'm going to be flying into, assuming I can get there with all the weather. You know, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  it's very interesting. I was a little surprised, governor. I had confided in you and told you and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  many other people, I said it publicly for years that I was going to get out of New York. I just [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=185.2s)]
*  want to play both Kathy Hockel and Andrew Cuomo basically saying they don't want conservatives in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=189.2s)]
*  New York. But I want you to answer under the prism of you have a larger population than New [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=196.0s)]
*  York. You have half the budget of New York. Your infrastructure is twice as good as New York. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=201.84s)]
*  And your schools are number one and your crime is half of what New York's crime is [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=207.04s)]
*  with half the money. But just listen to what these two governors had said to conservatives in the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=211.92s)]
*  state. And we're here to say that the era of Trump and Zeldin and Molinaro just jump on a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=216.72s)]
*  bus and head down to Florida where you belong. Okay. Get out of town. Get out of town. Cause you [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=226.32s)]
*  don't read, you don't represent our values. You are not New Yorkers. Their problem is not me and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=232.56s)]
*  the Democrats. Their problem is themselves. Who are they? Are they these extreme conservatives [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=239.44s)]
*  who are right to life, a pro-assault weapon, anti-gay? Is that who they are? Because if that's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  who they are and if they are the extreme conservatives, they have no place in the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=258.72s)]
*  state of New York. Because that's not who New Yorkers are. And he said, tax the rich, tax the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=264.0s)]
*  rich, tax the rich. We did. Well, God forbid the rich leave. Here's my question. I mean, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=270.32s)]
*  well, first of all, I'm not anti-gay, but I am pro-second amendment and I am proudly pro-life. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=275.2s)]
*  And I just listen to that. Get on a bus, get out of town. I mean, you're earning what? 400,000 new [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=281.04s)]
*  Floridians now, including me a year. I got to imagine you're pretty happy about that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=288.8s)]
*  And you know, obviously the upper income people save a lot of money because they chase them out, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=296.8s)]
*  but it's not just that Sean. I mean, the number of people that retire out of FDNY, NYPD, port [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  authority, where do they go? I mean, some of them obviously stay in the tri-state area, but a lot of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=307.6s)]
*  them moved to Florida. I mean, we've got a massive numbers of folks retired here who were active on [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=312.24s)]
*  9-11 and responded to the Twin Towers. So, you know, they're getting New York pension payments [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=317.44s)]
*  and they're spending it in Florida. And you're right. We have half the budget with much better [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=322.88s)]
*  results. Our state government in Florida is the smallest of employees per capita in the entire [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=327.52s)]
*  country. It just shows you the people in New York are getting taxed for your state government to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=333.84s)]
*  waste that tax dollars because we're doing better with half the footprint. But I also think what you [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=339.12s)]
*  showed with Hokel and Cuomo, there's this movement amongst the left to try to demand a one-party [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=345.04s)]
*  state and to try to weaponize government against conservatives. It's not surprising that you've [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  seen that with that line of thinking. I think it's really dangerous. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  thought California was bad. New York is just as bad, if not worse. And I'm still getting asked [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  questions about your debate with Gavin Newsom. Governor, thank you for being with us. Hey, Sean [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlutIjVqY_A&t=369.04s)]
