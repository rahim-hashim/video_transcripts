# Karoline Leavitt: Legacy media can't keep up with Trump
**Fox News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs)
*  Donald Trump will continue to drain the swamp, rack up achievement after achievement for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=0.0s)]
*  the American people to make America great. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  And just breaking, hours ago, Senator Susan Collins announced that she, in fact, will [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  vote to confirm Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence, a big win for Tulsi. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=13.0s)]
*  Here now with more, White House press secretary Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=19.52s)]
*  Caroline, great to have you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=22.32s)]
*  Great job on your first day. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=24.44s)]
*  I think you brought a little shock and awe into that room yourself. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=25.64s)]
*  How'd you like it? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=29.64s)]
*  Well, thanks so much for having me, Sean. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=33.08s)]
*  And I loved it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=35.08s)]
*  You know why? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=36.08s)]
*  Because I work for a president who is getting things done, who is delivering on the promises [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=37.08s)]
*  he made to the American people, and who speaks the truth. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  So I'm so humbled by the outpouring of support. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=45.36s)]
*  I've heard from people across the country saying, you know, we're doing such a great [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=48.16s)]
*  job at the White House. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=51.92s)]
*  Well, it's easy to do a good job when you are acting on common sense and you are speaking [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=52.92s)]
*  the truth. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  And that's exactly what President Trump is doing every single day. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Canada, Mexico, Panama, Denmark, Colombia, Venezuela, all have given in to Donald Trump. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=62.72s)]
*  They've all caved. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=70.72s)]
*  And, well, also over the weekend, not a small note, he did kill a bunch of ISIS terrorists [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=71.72s)]
*  that did not get a lot of media play. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=77.2s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=79.12s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=80.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=81.12s)]
*  There is so much good news, so much winning out of the Trump White House right now, that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=82.12s)]
*  the mainstream legacy media can't keep up with it because President Trump is signing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  executive order after executive order, delivering on promise after promise, and implementing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=91.68s)]
*  fundamental change of our bloated bureaucracy and our corrupt government here in Washington, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=97.72s)]
*  D.C. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=104.16s)]
*  He was given a once in a generation mandate by the American people to govern and to fundamentally [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=105.16s)]
*  transform Washington, and that's exactly what he is doing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=109.66s)]
*  And we finally, after four years of chaos and mayhem and apologizing for America, have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=113.84s)]
*  a president again in the Oval Office who is standing up for America. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=120.28s)]
*  And this is what it looks like when you have a leader of our great nation who uses the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  leverage of the United States, who understands that since our nation's founding, we have [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=129.62s)]
*  been viewed as that shining light on the Hill. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=135.44s)]
*  We have been viewed, rightfully so, as the best, proudest country in the world, and President [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=138.64s)]
*  Trump is not afraid to say that or to use that for the American people's benefit. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  And that's why you have seen so many countries around the world in just the matter of two [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  weeks cave to President Trump's demands. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=152.88s)]
*  In the past 24 hours, you have Canada and Mexico agreeing to help secure our southern [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=155.44s)]
*  and northern borders and these tariffs that President Trump threatened to impose on both [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Canada and Mexico, and they were signed, sealed, delivered, I may add. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=166.04s)]
*  Those were retaliatory tariffs for the last four years of treatment by Canada and Mexico [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=170.44s)]
*  of our nation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=176.32s)]
*  They have allowed an unprecedented wave of illegal, deadly drugs and illegal criminals [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=177.48s)]
*  on our territorial borders, and President Trump said enough is enough. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=183.32s)]
*  He is standing up for the American people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=187.76s)]
*  Too many lives have been lost at the hands of illegal migrants and Chinese fentanyl flowing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=190.0s)]
*  through our nation's borders, and he got Canada and Mexico to step up to the plate to surge [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  resources and personnel to our territorial borders and America and the American people [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  will be safer because of it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=206.72000000000003s)]
*  Never mind terrorists and cartels and murderers and rapists and American victims that I'm [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=208.52s)]
*  shocked Democrats don't seem to care a lot about. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=214.84s)]
*  Oh, I did fail to mention we had hostages released out of Venezuela. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=217.4s)]
*  I don't think most Americans, Caroline, even knew about that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=222.84s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=228.24s)]
*  It happened on Friday afternoon. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=229.08s)]
*  The legacy media went home, I guess, or they didn't want to report on more good news coming [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=231.28s)]
*  from the Trump administration. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=235.72s)]
*  But Rick Cornell went to Venezuela with two very clear directives from the president of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=237.44s)]
*  the United States. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=242.44s)]
*  Land repatriation flights of illegal Tren de Aragua gang members who have infiltrated [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=243.68s)]
*  our country under the Biden administration, get them back to Venezuela. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=249.4s)]
*  Done. Rick Grinnell did it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=253.44000000000003s)]
*  And number two, return the six U.S. hostages who have been held captive in Venezuela and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  the previous administration never even talked about Rick Grinnell on the behalf of President [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump using President Trump's negotiating leverage was able to get that done. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=265.72s)]
*  And then in that same day, we took out ISIS fighters in Somalia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=270.32s)]
*  Again, a story that the mainstream media doesn't want to cover. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=274.72s)]
*  And then Secretary of State Rubio, who's doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=278.20000000000005s)]
*  secured concessions from Panama. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=283.12s)]
*  They are no longer going to charge U.S. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  naval ships who go through the canal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  And they also have said they are no longer going to be part of the CCP led Belt and Road [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=289.68s)]
*  Initiative. So these small wins are racking up for the United States. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=295.32000000000005s)]
*  And the entire world knows that America is back. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  And remember, five years ago, when Joe Biden took office, that was his slogan. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  And we saw the deterioration of America over the past four years. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=307.76s)]
*  But now America is truly back and the world knows it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=311.36s)]
*  Just look at their actions. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=314.8s)]
*  Great job, by the way, welcoming in new media into the White House briefing room. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=316.88s)]
*  I thought that was warranted. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=320.72s)]
*  I believe legacy media has died. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=322.8s)]
*  The biggest freak out on the left now seems to be about USA, the Democrats. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=325.04s)]
*  I'll go through examples. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=329.76s)]
*  Senator Eric Schmidt put out 20 million dollars on a Sesame Street show in Iraq. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=331.68s)]
*  Fifty six million dollars to boost Egyptian Tunisian tourism. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=336.72s)]
*  Forty million to build schools in Jordan. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  We'll tell people about it more. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  Why would we be spending hard earned American taxpayer dollars on items like that and more? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=347.12s)]
*  Because Washington, D.C., for far too long, has been run by corrupt government bureaucrats [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=352.48s)]
*  who do not care about hard earned tax dollars that the American people are working for [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=360.48s)]
*  every single day. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=365.92s)]
*  And finally, it took President Trump and Elon Musk, who is serving as a great friend and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=367.12s)]
*  ally to the president, to start digging through the books of this bloated bureaucracy here [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=372.56s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  And the waste, the fraud, the abuse is alarming. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=378.88s)]
*  And that's why we are, President Trump is making monumental, transformative changes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  He was elected to do that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  And the Democrats are in complete disarray because they have become a globalist party [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=391.2s)]
*  who like to spend taxpayer dollars on useless priorities just to cater to the left's demands [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=396.96s)]
*  here at home. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=403.2s)]
*  When the vast majority of Americans want people in Washington to be good stewards of their [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  tax dollars, don't agree with these radical priorities of the left. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=409.84s)]
*  And so that's why the president is going to continue to do this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=413.44s)]
*  The Democrats can either get on board or they can prepare to lose another election, just [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=416.88s)]
*  like they did on November 5th. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=422.16s)]
*  I think we'll call when you're on the show the Washington briefing with Caroline Levitt. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=424.24s)]
*  I think I think it's a perfect we get an update on everything that's happening right [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=428.8s)]
*  now. A lot of good news, Caroline, we do appreciate your time. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=432.8s)]
*  Great job. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=435.12s)]
*  And we thank you for being with us. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmv3_8UrNs&t=436.08000000000004s)]
