# Biden was ‘lying’ to Americans about Hunter’s laptop: Rep. Mike Turner
**Fox News:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ)
*  What's going on? Here with more House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and House Intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee Chair Mike Turner. Jim Jordan, let's talk about this. First of all, they were organized [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=5.44s)]
*  by Wink and Tony Blinken. Number one, none of them ever knew a thing about the laptop. They didn't [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=11.6s)]
*  know anything. And they just, they signed the letter for one reason only, to help Joe Biden win [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=18.32s)]
*  when they knew how damaging that would be to his chances of winning in 2020. Is that election [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=25.44s)]
*  interference? Blinken calls Morrell. Everyone knew Morrell wanted to be the CIA director in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  the Biden administration. Morrell organizes the statement that 51 people signed. When he [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=37.6s)]
*  sends out the statement, he says, this is so Joe Biden will have a talking point against Trump [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=42.08s)]
*  during the upcoming debate. After the debate, Joe Biden's campaign chairman, Steve Reschetti, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=47.84s)]
*  calls Morrell and thanks him. But Sean, now we've learned three new additional facts. First, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=52.96s)]
*  the letter was actually reviewed by the top people at the CIA, either Director Haspel or [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=58.24s)]
*  Deputy Director Bishop. We deposed the Chief Operating Officer, Andrew McCrady. He said, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=63.52s)]
*  I took it to one of those two individuals. They reviewed it. Second, what you pointed out, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=68.64s)]
*  agents looked at this and said, this is not what the CIA should be doing. This is a bad look for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=73.28s)]
*  the CIA. This is all political. And third, some of the people who signed it, like Mike Morrell, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=78.24s)]
*  were actually on contract with the CIA when they signed it. That's how bad, that's how political [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=84.64s)]
*  this was. And to your final point, this is something our government had for a year. They [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=90.72s)]
*  had the laptop and they knew, they knew it wasn't hacked by Russia. And we know that the FBI had [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  verified its authenticity of March of 2020, Congressman Turner, and they were out there [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=102.88s)]
*  pre-bunking it with all big tech. And that ended up getting that very real laptop story by the New [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=108.16s)]
*  York Post censored nationwide. And polls shows that, in fact, had they not done that, Donald Trump [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  would have won that election if the American people knew the truth. Absolutely. Well, the House [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=122.64s)]
*  Intelligence Committee got these emails that showed that the manner in which this was presented [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=128.56s)]
*  and that we now know from the joint depositions that Jim's committee and my committee held that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=134.08s)]
*  these individuals openly were talking about doing this letter solely to help Biden in his [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=140.48s)]
*  in his debate. Now, what that means is we now all know that we saw Biden stand there in the middle [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=146.16s)]
*  of his debate and lie to the American public because he knew, of course, it wasn't Russian [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  disinformation. When he said, I have a letter that says this is Russian disinformation, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=156.48s)]
*  there's nothing to this, Biden was lying to the American public. But also everyone who signed [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=160.88s)]
*  that letter, the IC 51 as they're called, they were lying. And depositions, they, you know, one [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=166.0s)]
*  after the other would acknowledge they didn't even try to verify it. They knew what they were doing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=172.32s)]
*  This was totally political, totally for the debates and they were lies. Okay. Any possible [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=176.56s)]
*  consequences, Jim Jordan? Well, we'll look at legislation [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=182.72s)]
*  relative to their security clearance is what they can do if they're going to maintain that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=187.6s)]
*  security clearance. We're working with Chairman Turner and his committee on that. But I think [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=190.72s)]
*  it's real important to understand, Sean, this happened 15 days before the most important [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=194.88s)]
*  election we have. 15 days before an election, 51 former Intel officials sign a statement with [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=199.44s)]
*  their former titles by their name, a statement that was prompted by the Biden campaign, a statement [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=204.96s)]
*  signed by some who were on contract with the CIA, a statement that agents at the CIA knew they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=210.08s)]
*  shouldn't be involved in about a laptop our government had for a year and knew wasn't [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=214.8s)]
*  hacked by Russia. That'll happen 15 days before the election, which raises one fundamental question. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=219.68s)]
*  What are they going to try this time? What are they going to try before this election on November 5th? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  And remember, Joe lied about the laptop and that laptop implicates him as the big guy, 10% for him [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=230.0s)]
*  and 50% of Hunter's income goes to Pops and Hunter was paying for Pops' home repairs. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=237.2s)]
*  I think we need answers. I think Joe might need a lawyer come January. Thank you both. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3kWnlnx-TQ&t=244.23999999999998s)]
