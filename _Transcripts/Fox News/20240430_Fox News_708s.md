# New video shows Columbia agitators under arrest
**Fox News:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18)
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=0.0s)]
*  Here is video shot only moments ago by our very own cameras. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=2.16s)]
*  Now, you see these agitators were arrested only moments ago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=5.72s)]
*  Again, we're told—Lexus just told us there have been dozens of arrests tonight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=10.68s)]
*  And here with more reaction to what's going on in the situation in New York on the campus [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=16.0s)]
*  of Columbia University. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  What does it mean politically for Joe Biden, who has been virtually silent on most of this? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=23.06s)]
*  Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee is with us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=29.2s)]
*  Governor, I start with you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=33.92s)]
*  And we can only pray that this all ends peacefully for people on—you know, for everybody involved here. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=35.84s)]
*  The officers certainly had a very difficult job ahead of them as this began tonight. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=43.8s)]
*  So far, it looks like the arrests have gone as planned. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=48.56s)]
*  We can hope that happens. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=52.8s)]
*  We do have other problems that exist here, how this was able to build into this movement. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=54.88s)]
*  What does it say about, you know, a mindset in this country that is literally supporting, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=60.68s)]
*  you know, radical extremism abroad and even on college campuses? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=68.28s)]
*  What does it say when a rabbi in Columbia University's campus has to tell Jewish students [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=73.36s)]
*  to stay home? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=78.68s)]
*  It's not safe to be here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=80.04s)]
*  And it's not just Columbia. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=82.22s)]
*  It's Harvard. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=84.04s)]
*  It's Yale. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=85.04s)]
*  It's USC. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=86.04s)]
*  It's Berkeley. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=87.04s)]
*  It's UT. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=88.04s)]
*  It's all over the country. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=89.04s)]
*  Your reaction, Governor? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=91.72s)]
*  It looks like the police are doing their job, but here's the problem. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  They'll do their job, but Alvin Bragg won't do his. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=98.56s)]
*  He's so busy going after Donald Trump that he'll have these kids out in time for hot [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=101.0s)]
*  donuts and a warm cup of milk before midnight. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=106.12s)]
*  And that's pretty tragic, because unless there's some serious consequences, unless [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=109.2s)]
*  they're criminally prosecuted, unless they get treated like the January 6th defendants, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=113.32s)]
*  they get to spend months and months in jail before they even get a trial date, unless [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=118.44s)]
*  those kind of things happen, unless they get expelled, unless their parents are made to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=123.08s)]
*  pay for the damages. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=127.6s)]
*  I love what Alan Dershowitz said, let's sue them. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=129.28s)]
*  But here's another thing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=132.14s)]
*  If Donald Trump were president, you know what else would be happening? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=133.14s)]
*  There would be federal civil rights charges being filed against these people because he [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=135.48s)]
*  knows that the state's not going to do anything, not Kathy Hochul, certainly not Alvin Bragg, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=140.38s)]
*  not Letitia James. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=145.94s)]
*  They have their own agenda. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=147.14s)]
*  But the federal government could be doing something and could be charging for the civil [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=148.7s)]
*  rights violation of Jewish students. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=152.7s)]
*  And every parent of Columbia who's paying 90,000 bucks a year to send their little darling [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=154.9s)]
*  to this school full of little snot, they need to get their kids home, need to get them home. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=161.5s)]
*  And then they need to sue the school, get their money back, and file a class action [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=166.7s)]
*  suit on behalf of all parents and alumni for the disgraceful way that Columbia University [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  has just dripped right down into the toilet bowl. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you're raising a lot of good points. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  You know, Charlie, let me go to you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=183.82s)]
*  And I brought this point up many, many times. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=185.42s)]
*  We watched in the Summer of Love in 2020, we had 574 official riots around this country. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  We had dozens of dead Americans. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=196.28s)]
*  We had cops that were pelted with bricks, rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails, thousands [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=198.56s)]
*  of injured police officers, billions of dollars in property damage. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=204.06s)]
*  But we had fixation on one insurrection, one riot, and that was January 6th. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=209.36s)]
*  They had all the videotape evidence available to go after the people that were responsible [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=215.08s)]
*  for the rioting in the Summer of 2020. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=220.6s)]
*  It shows a clear double standard. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=223.66s)]
*  When earlier, when this all began at Columbia and some students were arrested, they were [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  immediately released and immediately their records were expunged. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=231.78s)]
*  So it seems Liz Cheney's been awfully quiet about, quote, insurrection, unless it involves [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=236.54s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=241.84s)]
*  And it's kind of sad, because I would argue that any riot, any time, any place is wrong. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=243.52s)]
*  And now we learn that they withheld evidence. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=249.46s)]
*  Now we learn that they ignored five people that would have testified that Donald Trump [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=251.62s)]
*  called up the National Guard. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=256.22s)]
*  They never interviewed the Capitol Police Chief, who requested the National Guard. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=257.86s)]
*  A lot of questions that they never went into now is becoming revealed. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=262.46s)]
*  But 574 riots, we were told they were mostly peaceful. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=266.58s)]
*  Well, are they going to claim that this is peaceful tonight, too? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=270.66s)]
*  Are they going to say it's okay for students to take over an entire hall at a university [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=273.62s)]
*  the way they took it over violently last night? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=279.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, let's be clear. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  If these were Trump supporters shutting down an American campus, or these were Republican [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  voters who were behaving like this on an American campus, hectoring students for their religion, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=291.18s)]
*  none of this would be happening. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=301.42s)]
*  This would all be wiped clean immediately. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=302.62s)]
*  The FBI would be on the scene. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  Everybody would be arrested and thrown under the jail. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  It would be a whole different scene. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=311.06s)]
*  But of course, I think probably the most important thing that we will remember from history when [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  we look back at this time is the degree to which Democrats, from Joe Biden all the way [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=319.54s)]
*  down to rogue local prosecutors, have taken the Justice Department and taken the system [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=325.48s)]
*  and used it as a political weapon to go after all of their political enemies. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=333.08s)]
*  And in this case, of course, Democrats, they made a deal with the devil. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  They're desperate to get these urchins here, these loud mouths, these punks. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  They're desperate to get them to vote for them. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=352.84s)]
*  So they're in a real pickle, and they don't know what to do. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=355.47999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, they should be charged to the fullest extent, just the way we all said should happen [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=359.64s)]
*  for January 6th. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=367.4s)]
*  Anybody that was trespassing, charge them with trespassing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=369.0s)]
*  The problem is they went so far beyond that and charged them with all this other stuff [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=371.32s)]
*  for which there was no evidence whatsoever. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=374.96s)]
*  What they put these people through is just astonishing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=379.8s)]
*  But the other thing I'd like to say is that Columbia University has a massive endowment. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=382.2s)]
*  It's tax free. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  They created this situation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  They allowed this to happen. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=393.12s)]
*  I can only imagine what this operation is costing the taxpayers of New York City. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=395.12s)]
*  I hope that Columbia University will be forced to pay NYPD for every dime of overtime, of personnel, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=401.52s)]
*  everything, every cost that they're having to spend for this should come right out of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  Columbia's endowment. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=418.56s)]
*  You know, that's such a good point. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=420.16s)]
*  And how many taxpayer dollars I think you can, you know, it's a fair time to ask the question. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=423.12s)]
*  These universities like Harvard, I think the last time I checked, Governor Huckabee had some, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  what, $37 billion in endowment money. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=434.4s)]
*  Why are taxpayer dollars going to these institutions? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=439.44s)]
*  And here's another sad part, and I don't want to really get too political tonight. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=443.28s)]
*  I'm really hoping for a peaceful end to what has been a very difficult night for the NYPD, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=447.36s)]
*  having to clear this hall out. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  And that would be my first prayer for everybody. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=456.4s)]
*  But the idea that taxpayers are footing the bill for these institutions of higher learning, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=459.68s)]
*  and the American taxpayer is footing that bill, and then you can add to that, you know, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  student loan forgiveness. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=471.44s)]
*  Why should plumbers, carpenters, electricians and nurses and people that paid their own way [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=473.84s)]
*  through school be funding universities that actually foster an environment where extremism [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=478.88s)]
*  like this can exist? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=485.36s)]
*  Well, I think Charlie's made a great point about the endowments, and I hope that the endowments [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=488.8s)]
*  have been drained to virtually nothing by the time the lawsuits are finished and people are suing [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=493.04s)]
*  these institutions for the matter in which they did not protect the students that were there for [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=498.0s)]
*  an education. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=503.44s)]
*  I hope that also there would be a real understanding about the message these kids are talking about. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=504.56s)]
*  They say, divest. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=509.12s)]
*  We demand that you divest from any dealings with Israel. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=510.48s)]
*  Okay, let's start right here. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=514.4s)]
*  You wouldn't have a cell phone if not for the technology that was developed in Israel. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=516.4s)]
*  So are all of those students, are they willing to give up their cell phones? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=521.76s)]
*  They're willing to give up their cell phones, seedless watermelons, tomato grapes, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=526.24s)]
*  irrigation for agriculture, heart stents, and about a thousand other things that were developed in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=531.04s)]
*  Israel. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=537.36s)]
*  Because if you really are serious about divesting, you're going to be living in virtually the land of [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=538.0s)]
*  the Flintstones when you could be living in the land of the Jetsons. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=542.16s)]
*  And that's because these young kids don't have a clue what they're talking about when it comes to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=545.52s)]
*  Israel, which is a very free, a very innovative and an extraordinary nation that they ought to be [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=550.0s)]
*  thanking God for rather than demanding that it be annihilated. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=555.6s)]
*  Yeah, Charlie, as we watch this unfold, we still have no idea how many more students may be inside. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=561.36s)]
*  We've seen dozens arrested so far, a very difficult police operation. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=568.64s)]
*  Thankfully, so far, according to all reports we have, it has been a peaceful effort by the NYPD. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=574.16s)]
*  They have successfully extracted the students that have taken over this hall. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=581.6s)]
*  We hope it ends that way for the benefit of all sides, but it's still unknown as this is an [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=586.08s)]
*  ongoing effort what's actually going on inside there. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, you make a really good point about not wanting to make this political tonight, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=598.0s)]
*  but of course this is happening in an election year. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  The blame for this lies at the feet of not just politicians currently, but going back [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=606.88s)]
*  years empowering these universities to do what they do and to miseducate [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=614.0s)]
*  a generation of students into their craziness that you get from these man on the street, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=621.28s)]
*  idiot on the street interviews with these morons. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=627.2s)]
*  But the thing that, you know, we can't take away the fact that this is happening in an election [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=630.96s)]
*  year, and Joe Biden is to blame for it. And my favorite thing is the thing you just mentioned, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=636.64s)]
*  which is, you know, this is going on at a time when Joe Biden has violated the order of the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=641.52s)]
*  Supreme Court, broken the law, violated the Constitution in order to do all this student [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=648.64s)]
*  loan forgiveness nonsense where, as you point out, plumbers and carpenters are having to pay [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=655.36s)]
*  for ridiculous college educations for students to hate Israel and hate Jews. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=661.44s)]
*  Well, you know, that's a great election year. That's a bumper sticker. You know, you're paying [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=667.28s)]
*  for this and all of these scenes that we're seeing on TV tonight, we've been seeing last [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=672.88s)]
*  couple of weeks and it's not going away. It's going to, we're going to be seeing it for months. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=678.08s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump can just say again and again, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=682.96s)]
*  thanks to Joe Biden, you're paying for every bit of this. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. All right. We appreciate both of you. Thank you, Charlie Hurt and Governor Mike Huckabee. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHMWA6Al18&t=695.76s)]
