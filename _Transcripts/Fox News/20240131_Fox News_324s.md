# Lindsey Graham to Biden: Hit Iran now and hit them hard
**Fox News:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU)
*  Here with reaction, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Senator, good to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=0.0s)]
*  Let me begin tonight with this. And I did, by the way, love your comments that they'll have [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=4.24s)]
*  blood on their hands, what's happening in the hearing today. We just had Josh Hawley on about. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=8.8s)]
*  OK, Joe Biden said he's going to respond. There's been nearly 200 attacks against [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=13.52s)]
*  American service members in Iraq and Syria. This day was inevitable because Joe didn't lift a finger [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=18.88s)]
*  over 100 and what, 75 attacks. He didn't do a thing except take out an empty warehouse. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=26.96s)]
*  So he's emboldened Iran the way I see it. What's your take? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=33.2s)]
*  Well, number one, you're dead right. Why did not, why didn't this happen on Trump's watch? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Iran was afraid of Trump. He killed the head of their revolutionary guard, Soleimani. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=43.04s)]
*  Biden has yet to hit Iran directly. The Iranians could care less how many hoodies you kill. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=50.16s)]
*  They could care less how many Iraqi militia you kill. The only way they will change your behavior [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=56.4s)]
*  and stop killing Americans and attacking our troops and trying to bomb ships in the Red Sea [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=61.84s)]
*  is for Joe Biden to hit their oil infrastructure and start killing their soldiers inside of Iran. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=67.68s)]
*  I'm not asking to invade Iran, but I'm calling on President Biden tonight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=73.84s)]
*  Go to the source of the problem. If you don't hit the Iranian oil infrastructure [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=78.4s)]
*  and hit them in the wallet and make them fear you, they're going to keep killing our soldiers to the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=82.88s)]
*  three families whose loved ones lost their life. It breaks my heart this was all preventable. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=88.0s)]
*  So Mr. President, hit Iran and hit them now and hit them hard to protect Americans in harm's way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=94.0s)]
*  I don't know if he has it in him. I mean, I want to be very clear here because there's not a single [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=101.52s)]
*  person watching right now. I think, I think the American people's appetite for a long, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  protracted conflict in that area of the world is probably zero at this point. However, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=111.52s)]
*  when you attack American troops nearly 200 times and then you kill American troops, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=117.2s)]
*  to not have a response at all is unfathomable to me. You are basically then giving them, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=122.8s)]
*  you know, free access to do whatever they want to American troops. There has got to be a [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=130.48s)]
*  proportional response. I like your idea. Take out their refineries. That is the, that is the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=135.52s)]
*  biggest source of wealth for the Iranian mullahs. I think that's a simple solution. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  I do too. And they would stop. They have four refineries you can see from space. Make sure [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=146.24s)]
*  if they do this again or do it now, they have three and if they keep doing it, they have two [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  and they will stop. They will give in when they're afraid of America. They were afraid of Donald [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump. To the American people, our soldiers are over there to make sure ISIS and Al Qaeda, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=161.92s)]
*  that they don't come back and hit us here at home. They're there to protect the homeland. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=167.76s)]
*  Iran's trying to drive us out of the mid-east. Mr. President, you owe it to those in harm's way [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  to have their back. The reason they're being attacked so often is that Iran doesn't fear you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=177.27999999999997s)]
*  If you hit Iranian oil infrastructure and hit them where it hurts, they would stop. Stop being [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=182.56s)]
*  afraid of the Ayatollah. He should be afraid of America. We've lost deterrence. In 2021, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=188.48s)]
*  the Taliban took over Afghanistan. In 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. In 2023, Hamas attacked [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  Israel. In 2024, they're attacking ships in the Red Sea. Biden has been a disaster in his first [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=203.76s)]
*  three years. Every year a war has started. So the IAEA and inspectors, they've actually [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=213.84s)]
*  gone public in saying Iran now is enriching military-grade uranium, that they could probably [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=222.8s)]
*  have a bomb if not in a couple of short weeks. Now, I don't know what the world's going to look [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=230.0s)]
*  like if the mullahs of Iran with their radical ideology have nuclear weapons. I'm not sure that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=236.08s)]
*  mutually assured destruction would deter them at all. That's a scary thought. What does the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=241.68s)]
*  region do about this? What does the world need to think about this? I was in Saudi Arabia over [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  the weekend. If Iran gets a bomb, they're going to get a bomb. See, the Ayatollah would use the bomb [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=251.52s)]
*  to destroy Israel because he's a religious Nazi. He believes that the missing Mahdi in a well, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=256.72s)]
*  the tenth imam, will come back to save the day when there's chaos in the world. He intends to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=262.48s)]
*  use the weapon for religious reasons. Rocket man's trying to keep his regime in survival mode. So [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=268.08s)]
*  here's what I would say to the American people. Biden's been in office three years. In 2021, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  the Taliban take back Afghanistan. 2022, Russia invades Ukraine. 2023, Hamas attacks Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=281.36s)]
*  Here's what's 2024. Iran's going to break out the nuclear bomb and it's up to Israel if we don't do [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  more to stop Iran. We're going to have a war with Iran in 2024 over their efforts to get a bomb. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=295.36s)]
*  And watch China. They're going after, quote, reunification with Taiwan. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=302.32s)]
*  If it's going to happen, I bet it happens this year. Lindsay Graham, thank you, Senator. Appreciate [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OybHxrsExHU&t=306.8s)]
