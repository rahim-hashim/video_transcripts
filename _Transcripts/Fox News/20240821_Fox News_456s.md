# Sen. Ted Cruz: It’s a frightening thing we’re watching
**Fox News:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0)
*  I'm joining us is Senator Ted Cruz from the great state of Texas. Senator, great to have you. We appreciate it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=0.0s)]
*  And we wish you were actually here with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=7.04s)]
*  Well, Sean, it's great to be with you. I'll tell you, I'm glad I'm not in Chicago. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=12.96s)]
*  We're seeing the images you're showing, the images of angry protesters, of violent pro-Hamas, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=17.44s)]
*  anti-Semitic, anti-Israel, Marxist, America-hating radicals. And that's just the delegates in the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=25.2s)]
*  convention, not even the protesters outside. It is a scary and it is a frightening thing that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=32.96s)]
*  we're watching. And I got to say the most ominous words I heard just a minute ago, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=42.24s)]
*  was Gavin Newsom saying that what happens in California is the future. I pray to God that's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=47.84s)]
*  not right because California is so much on the wrong track and the Democrats are promising to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=53.36s)]
*  bring the same chaos, the same crime, the same misery, the same people fleeing California [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=58.4s)]
*  because they cannot make ends meet. That's what the Democrats are promising to bring to the whole [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  country. You know, we watch this and I've been kind of on the same page as Newt Gingrich as it relates [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=70.08s)]
*  to, you know, if this becomes an issue-oriented campaign, if it becomes about let's decriminalize [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=77.76s)]
*  illegal immigration, for example, an issue that you've been facing down in Texas in a big way, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  if it becomes about free housing and health care and education and free college education, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  according to Tim Walz, for illegal immigrants, if it becomes about law and order, we've gone [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=95.44s)]
*  over extensively their record as it relates to what happened in the summer of 2020 in the rioting [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  in Minneapolis and also all across the country. And Kamala Harris, you know, her support of those [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=106.32s)]
*  that were rioting. If it comes about inflation and the economy and Americans here that she wants to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  would blow up the filibuster and pass the Green New Deal, $93 trillion, that's not capitalism any [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  longer, which is the greatest wealth-producing system ever. By the way, I see the police now [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=126.72s)]
*  seem to be moving towards the protesters as this confrontation is about to maybe hit ahead. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=131.76s)]
*  We're going to keep our eye on it. If it becomes about those issues, energy, no fracking, no drilling, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=137.04s)]
*  if it becomes about foreign policy, I think that this country would move in a very different [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=143.04s)]
*  direction. But 70 to 80 percent of these things that they stand for, most Americans don't know [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  about yet, Senator. How do you how do you bypass that? Well, Sean, you're exactly right. This [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=153.28s)]
*  election has to be about the issues. And if it's about the issues, we win. If it's about the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=159.68s)]
*  disaster of Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, the failures of their policy agenda, we win. If it's about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=164.72s)]
*  inflation that is hurting working families across this country, we win. If it's about the chaos at [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=170.64s)]
*  the southern border, the worst illegal immigration in our nation's history, 11 and a half million [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=175.76s)]
*  illegal immigrants, if that's what this race is about, we win. If it's about the disaster of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=180.56s)]
*  foreign policy, the Democrats abandoning Israel, the Democrats giving 100 billion dollars to Iran [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=185.44s)]
*  as they fund anti-Israel, anti-American terrorists, if that's what it's about, we win. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=191.52s)]
*  And that's why the Democrats don't want to talk about any of that. They're counting on the press [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=196.96s)]
*  just to paint Kamala Harris as to turn her into a modern day saint. It's why they don't let her [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=201.92s)]
*  talk. It's why she doesn't do media interviews. It's why she doesn't answer questions. It's why [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=208.48s)]
*  she just reads from a teleprompter because they want to make this all a warm, fuzzy, happy days [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=212.64s)]
*  are here again election. And they also want to argue as they're convinced that Donald Trump is [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=218.72s)]
*  the devil. They don't want to talk about the success of the record of President Trump, of the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=224.16s)]
*  record low unemployment, of the safety of the secure border, of the peace and prosperity of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=229.44s)]
*  the Abraham Accords, peace breaking out across the world. They don't want to talk about any of that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=234.88s)]
*  They just want to demonize and distract. And we've got just over 80 days to make sure the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=239.2s)]
*  American people are focused on the real issues that impact families in Texas and impact families [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=245.11999999999998s)]
*  all across the country. What do you make of what's happening? You know, for example, in the summer [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  of 2020, they had to support those people that were rioting because that was a big part of their [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=255.6s)]
*  base. Now they're dealing with, you know, we see it in the streets tonight in a confrontation with [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=260.56s)]
*  police tonight. They're dealing with probably the same radical base, but they don't want to alienate [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=264.96s)]
*  them. They want their votes. And so that will put them in a position to do what? What? To just ignore [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=271.68s)]
*  it and tell us like the 574 riots that killed dozens of Americans and injured thousands of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=278.56s)]
*  cops and created hundreds of billions in property damage were mostly peaceful. Is that what they're [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  going to tell us? Look, I think that's exactly what they're going to tell us. We all remember [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=288.96s)]
*  when CNN reported with a building that was lit up in flames and they described it as a mostly [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=295.44s)]
*  peaceful protest. The media is the Senator, if I may interrupt you for one second committed to lying. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, let's just dip in real quick. Chuck Schumer is on stage. One of the, I guess one of the people [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=307.76s)]
*  responsible for pushing out Joe Biden. Let's just listen in briefly. Friends, we're here to talk [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=315.92s)]
*  about one thing tomorrow and building a better tomorrow for all Americans. This November, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=321.76s)]
*  we can choose a brighter, a fairer, a freer future, or we can relive the dark night of Trump's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  American carnage. Only one candidate will move America forward. Kamala Harris. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=341.52s)]
*  All right, Senator Schumer, the majority leader in the U.S. Senate. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=352.96s)]
*  Senator Cruz, let me give you the opportunity to give the last word here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  Look, this is the radical Democrat party. Kamala Harris is the most radical presidential nominee [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  in our nation's history with a major party. Tim Walz is the most radical vice presidential nominee. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=368.72s)]
*  By the way, my Democrat opponent Colin Allred agrees with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=373.92s)]
*  on absolutely everything. He's up in Chicago celebrating their open border, their disastrous [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=378.56s)]
*  campaigns. My opponent's doing the same thing as Kamala Harris, hiding in the basement, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  not answering questions, but raising millions and millions of dollars because Chuck Schumer, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  the man speaking, has made clear I'm his number one target in the country. And Schumer and Soros [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=392.8s)]
*  are spending millions trying to beat me here in Texas. So I want to encourage folks listening, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=397.76s)]
*  come to our website. It's TedCruz.org. Come and contribute. Help us stand and fight to defend [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=402.56s)]
*  Texas and defend this country because the forces that want to turn America into California, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  they are flooding Texas with cash. I need your help. I need you to come to TedCruz.org. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=415.12s)]
*  Give 25, 50, 100 bucks. Stand up and fight. Stand up and fight to support Donald Trump. Stand up [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=420.8s)]
*  and fight to support me. And let's save this country. Let's pull it back from these radicals [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=427.04s)]
*  and Marxists who are trying to destroy the country we love so much. All right, Senator Cruz, thank you [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=432.0s)]
*  for joining us. It does look like there is a little bit of a retreat from some of these protesters, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  but you can see the police line is still holding. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bv0hVTmCu0&t=441.52000000000004s)]
