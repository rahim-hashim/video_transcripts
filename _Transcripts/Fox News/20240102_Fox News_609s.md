# Hannity: Democrats don't want to talk about this
**Fox News:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA)
*  And welcome to Hannity and happy new year and happy election year 2024. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=0.0s)]
*  Now the exodus out of big states like New Jersey, California, Illinois, and New York, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  it continues. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=9.92s)]
*  In fact, tonight we are now broadcasting from my new home, the great free state of Florida. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=10.92s)]
*  Like so many Americans, I left New York for good and am now in the state with, let's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=16.2s)]
*  see, warmer weather, law and order, better education, more freedom, better quality of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=20.92s)]
*  life, and guess what? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=26.32s)]
*  No state income tax. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=27.32s)]
*  Now, here is my prediction. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=28.56s)]
*  This mass migration out of deep blue states, like the ones I just mentioned, that will [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  continue a lesson until the change, they change their governing philosophies that are overtaxing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=35.24s)]
*  people, overregulating people, they're underperforming in schools and safety and issues of public [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=41.8s)]
*  importance. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=47.28s)]
*  And that's why it's happening. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=48.68s)]
*  But no matter what state you call home, I will say this, 2024 is going to be a critical [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=50.28s)]
*  year, not only for our country, but for the world. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=55.8s)]
*  As anyone who has lived in New York will tell you, yeah, elections have consequences and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  in just 11 short months and they will fly by, you, the American people, you will determine [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=63.36s)]
*  the future of our country and frankly, the trajectory of the world. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=68.84s)]
*  Now no one can predict the outcome, but I can tell you what the next year will look [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  like. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=77.6s)]
*  And by the way, anyone that does predict the outcome, they don't know what they're talking [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=78.6s)]
*  about. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=81.44s)]
*  It's too unpredictable. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=82.44s)]
*  They will be the most unpredictable presidential election year in our lifetimes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=83.52s)]
*  Now, Democrats, the media mob, they will work in unison. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=87.6s)]
*  That I can predict with certainty. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=90.96s)]
*  They will be on a never ending nonstop smear campaign. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=92.82s)]
*  Regardless of the Republican candidate, they will obsessively focus on Donald Trump, Donald [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=96.6s)]
*  Trump, Donald Trump, January 6th, January 6th, and of course, abortion. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=101.92s)]
*  They don't want to ever talk about Joe Biden's accomplishments. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=106.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  Because there really aren't any. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  They won't defend Biden's radical agenda because it has resulted in one national disaster [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=112.42s)]
*  after another. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  And you, the American people, you can see it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  They don't want to talk about Bidenomics because what, two thirds of our fellow countrymen [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  are living paycheck to paycheck and the American people are getting wrecked by Joe Biden's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=126.14s)]
*  economy of inflation, high interest rates. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=130.58s)]
*  They don't want to talk about Biden's performance on the world stage. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=134.18s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=137.22s)]
*  The president has been bullied over and over and over again by our top geopolitical foes [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=139.22s)]
*  as Joe has abdicated America's role on the world stage. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=143.94s)]
*  The world is paying a consequence. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=148.26s)]
*  We see China openly planning an invasion or what they call reunification. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=150.36s)]
*  It's an invasion of our ally Taiwan while harassing our military in the Pacific, both [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=154.94s)]
*  in international airways and international waterways, spying on our nuclear sites right [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=160.62s)]
*  here in the continental United States with a slow moving spy balloon that it turns out [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  they knew all about on top of all the intellectual property theft, all of their unfair trade [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=170.64s)]
*  practices. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=175.88s)]
*  We now see war in Europe as Russia invaded Ukraine and war continues there and it seems [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  like there's no end in sight. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=182.94s)]
*  Biden has utterly failed to deter what is one of the bloodiest conflicts in recent history. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=184.88s)]
*  And of course we have Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  They are enriching uranium at the fastest pace ever, all while directing proxy wars [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=193.96s)]
*  and other proxies to attack Americans and our allies all over the region. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Now we have war in the Middle East. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=204.36s)]
*  On U.S. troops, there have been 118 specific attacks, including five in the new year. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=206.28s)]
*  Even the Houthi rebels, a radical group formed from Yemen, by the way, funded by the Iranians. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  They're using fishing boats and rifles to wreak havoc on important shipping channels [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=219.64s)]
*  in the Red Sea, all while Joe Biden does little to nothing to respond. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=224.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, our southern border, it is worse than ever. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  We have a lot more on that coming up tonight. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=232.16s)]
*  And of course, crime is completely totally spiraling out of several, out of control of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=234.44s)]
*  many major American cities and even some small towns. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  And to put that special cherry on top, yeah, tax collection is now at an all time high [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  and with the extra two plus trillion dollars Biden added to the debt last year. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, we started this fiscal year in October with the national debt now, more than $34 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=254.11999999999998s)]
*  trillion. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=259.08s)]
*  That is a record and I don't know how we pay that back. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=260.08s)]
*  So make no mistake. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=263.24s)]
*  Joe Biden as your president has been and continues to be an abject failure, both at home and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=264.68s)]
*  abroad. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=270.08s)]
*  Don't expect to see much of Joe, by the way, in the lead up to November. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=271.08s)]
*  In fact, he will campaign probably less than any other candidate in modern history. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=275.12s)]
*  If Donald Trump or any Republican is the candidate, I even doubt he'll show up for one debate. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=280.56s)]
*  He will lurk in the shadows. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=285.32s)]
*  He will hide in the basement. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=286.56s)]
*  He will hide on the beach in Delaware while the media mob does all the heavy lifting for [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=288.04s)]
*  him. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=293.24s)]
*  Now, it's not even clear that Joe can do the lifting at all at this point. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=294.24s)]
*  Even the most basic conversations are now really difficult for your commander in chief. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=298.36s)]
*  And here's just the latest and greatest. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=303.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  Mr. President, before we start here about the new year, I'm curious, what sort of holiday [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  foods have you been enjoying over the last few days? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=311.64s)]
*  Well, I've been eating everything that's put in front of me. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=313.96s)]
*  I've been eating pasta, which I love. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=316.8s)]
*  Eating a lot of chicken, chicken parmesan. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  I've been eating all Italian foods, basically. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  And ice cream. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=323.84s)]
*  And ice cream, chocolate chip ice cream. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=324.96s)]
*  Mr. President, what's your video's resolution, sir? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=326.44s)]
*  Next year. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=330.44s)]
*  Anything else? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=332.44s)]
*  That's the biggest one right now. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=334.44s)]
*  Now, Joe Biden's cognitive ability is not good. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=337.44s)]
*  Anyone with eyes to see, you can see it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=340.04s)]
*  Every week it gets worse, and it's getting worse by the day. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=342.8s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, Biden is also dealing with very real and serious corruption and bribery [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=346.28s)]
*  allegations, along with a very real impeachment inquiry. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=351.96s)]
*  And his image as a loving father and grandfather, well, that has forever been shattered and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=356.04s)]
*  tarnished by, frankly, his disgusting treatment of his own four-year-old granddaughter in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  Arkansas. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=366.16s)]
*  In other words, there are almost endless reasons to dislike Joe Biden, both politically and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=367.16s)]
*  personally. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=372.8s)]
*  And now, according to Gallup, Biden's year-end approval rating is now lower than any other [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=373.88s)]
*  first-term president in modern history going into a, quote, re-election year. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=378.8s)]
*  He's even losing support among very key demographics, a big part of what is the Democratic coalition, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=384.12s)]
*  that which, quote, propelled him to victory in 2020. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=390.35999999999996s)]
*  Look at this new USA Today, Suffolk University poll. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=393.68s)]
*  Only 63% of African-American voters support Joe Biden. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=396.96s)]
*  Why is that significant? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=400.76s)]
*  Well, that's down from 87% that he was receiving in 2020, and it only gets worse from there. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=401.76s)]
*  Biden now trails Trump among Hispanic voters by five points after easily winning a majority [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=408.88s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=415.08s)]
*  And get this, Biden is down four points with another key constituency among the Democratic [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=416.4s)]
*  base, and that is voters under 35, a usually very reliable Democratic voting bloc. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=422.04s)]
*  If these numbers hold, Joe Biden, if there's, if he's their candidate for re-election, he [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=429.08s)]
*  will lose today in a landslide. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=434.32s)]
*  A lot can happen between now and November. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=436.9s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=439.14s)]
*  So let me start this year with a warning to conservatives and to Republicans. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=440.46s)]
*  If you want any chance of winning in November, you need to do a couple of fundamental basic [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=445.18s)]
*  things. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=450.5s)]
*  One, any conservative, any Republican, any voter that has any reluctance or any resistance [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=451.5s)]
*  to voting by mail and voting early, you have to get over that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=457.82s)]
*  You just can't start out these races on election night down by hundreds of thousands of votes [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=462.34s)]
*  and depend on people voting day of to make it up. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=468.9s)]
*  Also, many states that allow legal ballot harvesting, keyword legal, and Republicans, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=472.21999999999997s)]
*  they need to start matching the very, very well organized Democratic Party efforts. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  That would be critical. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=483.5s)]
*  GOP organizers in every state need to do it, especially the swing states. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=484.82s)]
*  They've got to adopt what is a robust operation that is basically puts them on a level playing [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=489.22s)]
*  field and working within the system, not the one you want. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=494.98s)]
*  It's not the system I want. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=498.5s)]
*  I want day of voting, election day to be a natural, a national holiday, and I want paper [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=499.74s)]
*  ballots. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=504.46000000000004s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=505.46000000000004s)]
*  And I want voter ID and I want partisan observers watching the voting all day and the vote counting [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  all night. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=510.90000000000003s)]
*  In a perfect world, that would be what happens, but it's not the reality. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=511.90000000000003s)]
*  That is not our current reality. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=516.36s)]
*  Republicans, you have to deal with the system. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=518.14s)]
*  The hand you're dealt, not the one you wish you had. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=520.5s)]
*  My last piece of advice is on the controversial issue of abortion. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=523.18s)]
*  Not my moral point of view, but I'm looking at it politically. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=527.26s)]
*  Now, first leave abortion to the states. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=530.06s)]
*  That's what Roe v. Wade did and I believe is more constitutional. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=532.98s)]
*  If Republicans, if you want to push restrictive bans on abortion, like for example, Doug Mastriano [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=537.54s)]
*  running for governor in Pennsylvania, no restrictions, rape incest mother's life. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=544.1s)]
*  He lost by a margin of like 16 points that had not been seen in Pennsylvania history [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=548.98s)]
*  since the 1940s against a non-incumbent opponent. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=555.4200000000001s)]
*  You'll pay a heavy political price. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=559.86s)]
*  And by the way, you'll have no ability to even stop late term abortions that many Democrats [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=561.82s)]
*  support. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=567.46s)]
*  You can get the high ground on the issue. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=568.46s)]
*  Look at Ohio. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=569.7800000000001s)]
*  That is a state that Donald Trump won twice by a very comfortable margin. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=571.14s)]
*  Voters overwhelmingly approved a measure to make abortion a constitutional right in that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=575.38s)]
*  red state. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=580.8599999999999s)]
*  That ought to tell you a lot about the issue of abortion. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=582.06s)]
*  GOP candidates, you need to be smart about this because in 11 months, you have a prime [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=584.6999999999999s)]
*  opportunity to regain power in DC and get our country back on track before it's too [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj6iBoFouDA&t=590.3s)]
