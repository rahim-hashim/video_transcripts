# This is scary for America: Ex-White House chief of staff
**Fox News:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y)
*  Here with reaction, former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, the co-host of The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Big Money Show on Fox Business, Brian Bremberg is with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=4.76s)]
*  All right, Reince, am I wrong in my observation? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=8.56s)]
*  I mean, he couldn't do the Super Bowl interview. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=11.56s)]
*  I think that's very revealing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=14.64s)]
*  But when it comes to the State of the Union, you read a few lines, they clap, you take [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=16.84s)]
*  a drink of water. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=22.16s)]
*  If Nancy Pelosi was a speaker, you'd watch her tearing up a Donald Trump speech. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=23.68s)]
*  Not that hard to do, is it? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=28.68s)]
*  Not hard to do, but I'm not sure how it's going to go tomorrow night. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=32.88s)]
*  I mean, I think things have changed in the last year. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=37.68s)]
*  And listen, you're right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=41.12s)]
*  It's not about age. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=44.08s)]
*  I mean, what the Democrats are doing now is they're trying to turn this whole argument [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=45.08s)]
*  into, well, yeah, he's old and they're both old. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  It's not about being old. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=53.0s)]
*  It's what my mom says now that she's older and she's sharp as a tack. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=55.36000000000001s)]
*  She'll argue anyone under the table. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=58.32s)]
*  But she always says, you know, the older you get, the more important it is to act younger [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=60.64s)]
*  than you are. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=65.56s)]
*  And let's not forget the Her Report. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=67.16s)]
*  In the Her Report, they talked about diminished faculties, a bad memory, and they said he [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=68.60000000000001s)]
*  committed the act of the willful retention of documents. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  But then they said, but we don't know if he's competent enough as a witness to stand trial. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=78.76s)]
*  And that tells you everything you need to know. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=86.36s)]
*  And in 70, in the exit polls yesterday, 73 percent of Democrats said that the person [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=88.64s)]
*  they were voting for was too old to be president, and 75 percent said they wished that they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=96.2s)]
*  had a different candidate. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=102.28s)]
*  So look, Joe Biden's at rock bottom, not to mention the economy and everything else and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=104.44000000000001s)]
*  where they're, how they're doing with women, with black voters, with Hispanic voters, with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=109.28s)]
*  young voters, with voters in the Midwest. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=114.76s)]
*  We've got to be sharp because it's going to come down to 100,000 votes in five states, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  and it's going to be a dogfight. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=122.22s)]
*  But Joe Biden's at rock bottom, and I agree with what you're saying, and it's actually [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=124.64000000000001s)]
*  pretty scary for the country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=129.76s)]
*  And what they're telegraphing, and Brian, they've been out there pushing by dynamics, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=133.48s)]
*  and what they're telegraphing more likely to hear tomorrow night is, well, forget about [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=136.6s)]
*  the buck stops with him. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=141.2s)]
*  He's going to blame greedy corporations and shrink-flation on companies and attack them [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=142.92s)]
*  for his failed policies. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=150.12s)]
*  And after three years of saying the border is secure and the border is closed, he's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=152.76s)]
*  going to blame Republicans for the issues involving the border, which is, it's not really [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=156.96s)]
*  even funny considering the danger that he has now put the country in with nearly 10 [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=163.28s)]
*  million unvetted, illegal Joe Biden immigrants from countries that are our top geopolitical [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=168.6s)]
*  foes in many cases. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=175.66s)]
*  Yeah, let me just go to the economics since that's my thing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  He's going to cite the authority of a Muppet to tell you that shrink-flation with cookies [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=181.58s)]
*  is our biggest problem. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=187.26000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=189.94s)]
*  And then what he's going to do is create a strike force of his FTC and his DOJ. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=190.94s)]
*  And of course, that's the Elizabeth Warren wing of his bureaucracy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=196.78s)]
*  And what they're going to start doing is suing more companies. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  They're going to make companies lawyer up to defend their higher prices, which means [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  what? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  His prices are going to go up as these companies have to lawyer up. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=210.82s)]
*  He's going to accomplish exactly the opposite of what he said. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=214.82s)]
*  And he's going to do it based on bogus Muppet economics while he ignores the real issues [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=219.22s)]
*  in this country. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=225.1s)]
*  And Sean, I hope for our sake as a country, he nails his State of the Union tomorrow night. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  But I will tell you, if you want to bet a dinner on that, I'd be the first guy to take [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  you up on it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=235.94s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=236.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=237.94s)]
*  You got a deal. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=238.94s)]
*  I always like, you know, a good fun bet. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=240.18s)]
*  We know what their game plan is. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=242.9s)]
*  They've telegraphed it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=244.26s)]
*  You just heard Hillary. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=245.26s)]
*  Democracy and peril. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=246.26s)]
*  Ironically, from the same people that would like one politician, even though Donald Trump's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=247.66s)]
*  never been charged with insurrection, they want to try, convict him, kick him off the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=252.54s)]
*  ballot. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=257.38s)]
*  If you want to talk about democracy and peril, they'll talk about Donald Trump is evil. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=258.38s)]
*  They'll talk about January 6th. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=261.98s)]
*  They'll talk about demagogue abortion. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=264.78s)]
*  And then the usual rights, Republicans are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=267.22s)]
*  transphobic. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  They want dirty air, water, and they want to kill granny and grandpa. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  So that's their whole plan. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=277.06s)]
*  They can't run on, are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  That's what they do every two and four years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=281.26000000000005s)]
*  Will it be successful? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=284.06s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be successful because you've got to look at the numbers. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=287.3s)]
*  24% of the American people say we're on the right track, number one. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=290.54s)]
*  On the issue of democracy, Trump and Biden are tied on the issue of who would be better [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=295.22s)]
*  for democracy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  For all the work they've put into this, they're tied. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=302.82000000000005s)]
*  And the other thing is if they really thought democracy was actually going to be in danger, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=307.62s)]
*  our republic is going to go down, why would they be sitting there with Joe Biden? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  Either they don't believe the talking point or they're lying. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=315.42s)]
*  But one of the two. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=319.62s)]
*  And the last thing, this shrinkflation and the inflation issue itself is one of the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=321.02s)]
*  reasons why the middle class is flooding to the Republican Party because these people [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=325.86s)]
*  have flooded the markets with too much money. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  And guess who's paid for it? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=333.7s)]
*  All the people in the middle. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=335.14s)]
*  And by the way, they're also populating our military with their kids. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  And what are they getting from this economy? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=340.5s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=342.62s)]
*  They're getting nothing, which is why they're losing the middle class and they're losing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=343.62s)]
*  in the Midwest. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=346.9s)]
*  All right, Reince Priebus, thank you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=348.9s)]
*  And Brian, our bet is on. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=352.82s)]
*  I'll talk to you either later this week or next week. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oeUPOpP5Y&t=353.82s)]
