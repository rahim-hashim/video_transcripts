# Sean Hannity: Democrats tonight were ‘so pathetic’
**Fox News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0)
*  All right, thanks, Fred and Martha. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  And yes, we are live. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  We are in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=4.28s)]
*  We're only moments ago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=5.28s)]
*  President Trump wrapped up his first joint address to Congress of his second term. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=6.68s)]
*  Coming up, we got a lot of reaction analysis from several people who were inside the chamber. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=10.8s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz will join us, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, our Treasury [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=16.16s)]
*  Secretary Scott Bissen, and House Speaker Mike Johnson and many other special guests. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=21.68s)]
*  Also check in on our friends in the Democratic Party. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=26.36s)]
*  We'll continue to make just utter fools of themselves with their little props and disruptive [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=29.88s)]
*  outbursts and coordinated smears and even some vigorous cane waving. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=34.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=39.28s)]
*  We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=40.28s)]
*  Small business optimism, so its single largest one month gain ever recorded a 41 point jump. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=56.16s)]
*  Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House and to cease any further [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  disruptions. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=79.24s)]
*  That's your warning. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=80.24s)]
*  Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum and the chair is prepared [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=87.16s)]
*  to direct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=91.84s)]
*  Alright, a lot more on these antics in just a moment. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  While Democrats, they play stupid games with their performative stunts, President Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=101.84s)]
*  is on the move. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=106.12s)]
*  The nation saw that tonight in all of its force, if you will. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=107.56s)]
*  In only six weeks we have seen more action, more results from the Oval Office than almost [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=112.4s)]
*  anyone thought possible. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=117.36s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=118.68s)]
*  I return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back, our spirit [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=119.68s)]
*  is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back, and the American dream is surging [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  bigger and better than ever before. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=133.62s)]
*  And we've ended weaponized government where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=136.96s)]
*  to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=142.32s)]
*  How did that work out? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=149.12s)]
*  Not too good. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=150.6s)]
*  Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  border and I deployed the U.S. military and border patrol to repel the invasion of our [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=158.56s)]
*  country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=165.16s)]
*  And what a job they've done. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=166.64s)]
*  As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=169.32s)]
*  Ever. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=176.68s)]
*  To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, ten old [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=177.68s)]
*  regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first day. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=188.28s)]
*  And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  It's back. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies all across [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=204.56s)]
*  the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=211.06s)]
*  And our country will be woke no longer. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=225.52s)]
*  And in the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years, balance the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=235.04s)]
*  federal budget. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=242.2s)]
*  We're going to balance it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=243.2s)]
*  On top of all that, President Trump created Doge to identify waste fraud, abuse, corruption [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  now rampant inside our federal bureaucracy, including Social Security fraud. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=252.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=257.4s)]
*  1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=258.4s)]
*  130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=265.44s)]
*  We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobbie. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=278.92s)]
*  Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=295.92s)]
*  One person between the age of 240 and 249. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=306.4s)]
*  And one person is listed at 360 years of age. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=310.68s)]
*  More than 100 years. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=317.56s)]
*  More than 100 years older than our country. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=318.56s)]
*  But we're going to find out where that money's going. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=325.56s)]
*  And it's not going to be pretty. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=330.24s)]
*  And of course, the Bobby Kennedy joke, one of the big lines of the night. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=333.56s)]
*  Of course, the Democrats in the room did not celebrate Doge. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=336.52s)]
*  In fact, they couldn't even bring themselves to stand and cheer for President Trump's pledge [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=339.88s)]
*  to remove taxes on tips and overtime and Social Security. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=344.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=348.68s)]
*  Very, very big part of our plan. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=349.68s)]
*  We had tremendous success in our first term with it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=352.0s)]
*  A very big part of our plan. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=354.32s)]
*  We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=355.96s)]
*  And to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation, I'm calling [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=360.0s)]
*  for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=366.08s)]
*  great seniors. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=373.8s)]
*  Democrats tonight were so pathetic. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=379.0s)]
*  They couldn't even stand for Blake and Riley's family. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=383.0s)]
*  Jocelyn Nungary, his mother, a slain officer's wife, Stephanie Diller. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=384.8s)]
*  They couldn't even stand for a beautiful 13-year-old cancer survivor who dreams of being a police [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=390.32000000000005s)]
*  officer and tonight became a Secret Service agent. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=395.72s)]
*  D.J. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=399.12s)]
*  Daniel. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=400.12s)]
*  He said, this is my fifth time at a joint address from President Trump. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=401.12s)]
*  And sadly, there is nothing this president could do or say that would make these Democrats [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  stand and cheer. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  This has now become a party of rage and hate, a radicalized party reduced to a collective [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=412.68s)]
*  temper tantrum, sitting on their hands doing nothing for the EU, the American people. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  But tonight, this is also a defeated party. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=423.92s)]
*  No solutions, no coherent message, no plan for the future, simply reduced to political [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  stunts and smears and outright lies. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=431.8s)]
*  And they were holding the little signs that read, save Medicaid, even though President [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=434.76s)]
*  Trump promised to protect it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  The Congress held signs smearing Elon Musk. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=440.52000000000004s)]
*  Congresswoman Tlaib brought her very own white board. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=442.92s)]
*  Paul Roe will be jealous, presumably so she could make it up as she goes along. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=445.72s)]
*  But tonight's speech wasn't about the angry Democrats that have no vision for our country [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  on the left side of the chamber. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=456.04s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it wasn't even about politicians on either side of the aisle. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=457.04s)]
*  As always, President Trump's speech was dedicated to you, the people that make this country [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  great, the American people. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=466.48s)]
*  A few months ago, the president highlighted the courage of one brave young man from Texas. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=468.24s)]
*  This was quite a moment. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  Joining us at the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  His name is DJ Daniel. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=481.52s)]
*  He is 13 years old and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=482.92s)]
*  But in 2018, DJ was diagnosed with brain cancer. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=490.91999999999996s)]
*  The doctors gave him five months at most to live. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=496.04s)]
*  That was more than six years ago. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  Since that time, DJ and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=512.84s)]
*  And DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=519.12s)]
*  A number of times. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=525.44s)]
*  Peace. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=526.64s)]
*  The police love him. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=527.64s)]
*  The police departments love him. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=528.64s)]
*  And tonight, DJ, we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=530.52s)]
*  I am asking our new Secret Service Director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=535.12s)]
*  of the United States Secret Service. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=542.24s)]
*  How great was that? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgAn5ZGMgE0&t=555.24s)]
