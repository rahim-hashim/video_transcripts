# Trump is intolerant of terrorist activity, says Steve Witkoff
**Fox News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE)
*  special envoy to the Middle East. He was the one that picked up Mark Fogel in Russia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=0.0s)]
*  had a chance to meet with Vladimir Putin, Steve Witkoff. First of all, thank you. Thank Secretary [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=6.16s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio. Thank the president, everybody involved. I'm so glad this man is home. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=12.48s)]
*  Well done, my friend. Great job. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=18.56s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. And thanks for having me this evening. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=21.52s)]
*  We appreciate you being here. Okay, let's walk through. You're the special, by the way, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=24.48s)]
*  because we're friends personally, I've known you for a long time. And, you know, your life has [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  changed rather dramatically in the last eight months. And you're involved in a lot of high [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  level negotiations to bring peace around the world. And then the next thing I know, you're [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=40.72s)]
*  headed to Russia, and you're bringing home an American hostage held for three and a half years [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=45.28s)]
*  and meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. I would say your life has changed quite a bit. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=50.32s)]
*  Well, it's changed in the sense that the president has given me a gift, a gift of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=57.28s)]
*  doing something larger than I've ever done before, helping others. It's a blessing for me, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=64.0s)]
*  and I'm just so grateful to him. Let's talk about how this was all unfolding. Tell me from the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=69.6s)]
*  beginning what your involvement was, and let's talk very specifically about you boarding that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=78.88s)]
*  airplane, your own airplane, as my understanding, and flying over to Russia and what all of that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  was like and what took place. Well, we got a, we had a reach out from someone who is a go-between [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=92.88s)]
*  between the Russian government and the American government, and I presented it to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  our national security advisor, Mike Walz, in addition, Marco Rubio, John Radcliffe, our CIA [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=107.92s)]
*  director, and our vice president, J.D. Vance, as well as Susie Wiles, with the president. And we [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  all determined that it was credible, that there was an opportunity to get Mark Fogel back, and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=124.0s)]
*  that I should pursue it. And the president, as he usually does, listens carefully, decided it was [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=130.0s)]
*  actionable, and said hop on the plane and let's hope to get a good result. And that's really how [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=137.28s)]
*  it happened, Sean. So when you got on the plane, you did not know the ultimate outcome? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=143.36s)]
*  You know, we thought we had a very, very good chance of Mark coming back. We weren't positive. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=152.08s)]
*  There were still some things that I'm not at liberty to talk about tonight, but there were [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=157.92s)]
*  still some things that were up in the air. But we thought, we thought it was a strong enough [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  opportunity that we had to go and, and, and hopefully we'd have a good result. And of course, we did. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=169.04s)]
*  So I'm grateful for that. I'm grateful for the Fogel family, and I'm, I'm grateful for the world [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  to see my, our friend Sean greet Mark Fogel last night. He called it the privilege of his life [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  to meet the president. It was snowing out. He came out in his coat, greeted Mark, spent time with him [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=192.0s)]
*  like they were best buddies from their college years. It was, it was really beautiful to watch. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=199.12s)]
*  I know the president had a very long conversation with Vladimir Putin today of great significance, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=204.96s)]
*  including ending war in Europe between, between Russia and Ukraine. We know President Zelensky [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=212.24s)]
*  has now expressed a desire for this war to come to a conclusion and a negotiated settlement. I [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=218.08s)]
*  interviewed him myself. When you got there, did you get time with Vladimir Putin? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=223.52s)]
*  You know, I, I, I can't talk about that, Sean, because, well, I'm fair enough. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=231.68s)]
*  Yeah, I, I, I, I thank you. I thank you. I thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=239.04s)]
*  Okay. But you know, to me, if we're going to look at the broader picture and, and you really want to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=243.84s)]
*  help negotiate a peace in the Middle East and the president meeting with King Abdullah, I thought, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=251.04s)]
*  made a lot of progress. I, I heard things come out of Abdullah's mouth that I never thought I'd hear [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=256.08s)]
*  from the king and, and others in the region seem more open to what is a really innovative new idea. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=260.64s)]
*  We'll go in, we'll clean up the rubble. We'll get rid of all, we'll demilitarize the area. We'll, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=270.64s)]
*  we'll create jobs and a beautiful new city, you know, for the people there. That, that to me would [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=277.2s)]
*  be innovative and that's the broader context. And I know you're working hard towards that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=283.44s)]
*  What is the broader context here when you have president Zelensky on the one hand saying that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=287.84s)]
*  he is now open to a negotiated settlement and this gesture from Vladimir Putin? I can only [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  interpret that as both sides now seem ready to talk peace and they want the death, the destruction, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=302.08s)]
*  you know, to come to an end. I would imagine that settlement would probably look something like, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=309.76s)]
*  okay, Ukraine agrees not to join NATO. They probably would give up some of the, the areas [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=314.96s)]
*  in Ukraine that have heavy Russian populations, a little bit of land in the process as well, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=321.52s)]
*  and also have assurances of their security moving forward. Does that sound [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=327.44s)]
*  like the parameters of a deal that might, might occur? It sounds like you should be running the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=332.56s)]
*  deal yourself, Sean. I don't have your great negotiating skills, Steve. You're, you're, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=337.6s)]
*  you're far more charming than I am. Lastly, tell us your take on where we are in the Middle East. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=345.12s)]
*  The president has drawn a very, very tough line in the sand, Saturday at noon, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=352.88s)]
*  or all hell breaks loose. What do you think happens? Well, well, first of all, Sean, you know, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  the president in his typical, sensible, grounded way looks at Gaza and says, we've been doing it [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=365.68s)]
*  the same way for 50 years, and here's where we end up in the same place with a, with a city that's [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=372.48s)]
*  been destroyed. Maybe it's time to start to think a little bit differently, be more uplifting in our [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=378.56s)]
*  thoughts with regard to Palestinians and what the opportunities should be for them, not to live in [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=385.36s)]
*  an area that's decimated, but alternatively to have prospects for jobs and economic success and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=392.16s)]
*  to change their lives. And that vision also holds true with regard to Hamas. He is just intolerant [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=398.56s)]
*  of terrorist activity, as most of us are. I, he, I think his sense and certainly my sense, I agree [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  with him completely, is that that whole region has been held hostage to Hamas. And we're just not [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  going to have it anymore. It has to be demilitarized. And, and Iran could no longer be funding these [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=421.68s)]
*  proxy wars the way they have. You are on the plane with Mark Fogle, you know, for this trip home from [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=427.12s)]
*  Russia. When he got to the White House last night, he was obviously very emotional, but also [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=433.44s)]
*  extraordinarily humbled and grateful and happy to be home. Three and a half years is a long time [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  to spend in a Russian prison. Any insight as to how he was on the plane? Sean, he was amazing. He [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=446.0s)]
*  talked to his mom, she's 95 years old. He talked to his wife, he called his children. We had a [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=454.24s)]
*  discussion about not playing the victim, being grateful for this opportunity. Other people [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=460.56s)]
*  would have loved, who were left, who unfortunately we, we didn't get out and hopefully we will in [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=467.28s)]
*  the future. They didn't have this opportunity yesterday. He's an exceptional man. And he was [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=472.32s)]
*  wonderful with the president. He came off, came, he got out of the car entering the White House and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=478.48s)]
*  he had the American flag draped around him. And he expressed how grateful he was and the honor that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=484.08s)]
*  it was for him to have been invited to the White House last night. And the president took him upstairs [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=490.24s)]
*  to the Lincoln room and he saw the original Gettysburg address. And I think he was pinching [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=495.52s)]
*  himself even after three and a half years in prison. I think he considered himself to be [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=500.88s)]
*  fortunate. He's an example of a very, very courageous person and I'm glad I had the privilege to meet him, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=505.6s)]
*  to know him. I'll stay in touch with him and to play a small part in getting him his freedom. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=513.6s)]
*  All right, Steve, great job. We appreciate it. I think you're pretty humble on all this. We're grateful he's home. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=519.92s)]
*  you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKb4Whp7zFE&t=530.88s)]
