# Hannity: This is a 'shady cabal' happening before our eyes
**Fox News:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA)
*  But we begin with an alarming story from the East Coast of the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=0.0s)]
*  For nearly a month, since November the 18th—that's over three weeks, night after night after night—residents [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=4.96s)]
*  in part of the great state of New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, they have looked into [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=12.68s)]
*  the sky at night. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=17.88s)]
*  They have observed something very, very unusual, dozens of large, unidentified objects the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=19.6s)]
*  size of a bus as loud as a Harley flying extremely low and have been spotted and filmed across [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=25.6s)]
*  multiple locations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=34.04s)]
*  Forty-nine sightings this past Sunday alone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=35.56s)]
*  Now, some look like drones with FAA-mandated red and green lights hovering above neighborhoods. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Others look like something from, you know, out of this world, with claims from even elected [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=44.84s)]
*  officials that they emerged from the ocean. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=49.64s)]
*  In New Jersey, police chiefs said that these objects have been reported above key pieces [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  of infrastructure like water, reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  police departments, military installations. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=64.16s)]
*  And according to CBS News, the police chief added that their presence appears nefarious [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=67.08s)]
*  in nature. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=72.3s)]
*  Now, Congressman Chris Smith, he said that more than a dozen of these possible drones [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=73.3s)]
*  stalked a U.S. Coast Guard vessel in the Atlantic Ocean, with another 50 spotted above [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=77.84s)]
*  Island Beach State Park in New Jersey. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=84.16s)]
*  Now, similar flying objects, they were even seen above Trump's Bedminster Golf Course [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  and in Brooklyn. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  Another dozen drones, they were witnessed near the Verizon—Varizona narrow bridge, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=93.28s)]
*  and the FAA just issued a flight restriction for multiple areas where these flying vessels [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=99.76s)]
*  were spotted. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  New Jersey lawmakers, they are calling for a state of emergency. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=106.56s)]
*  Of course anxiety is running high, and rightfully so. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=111.0s)]
*  There are random objects the size of a bus that sound like a Harley hovering all over, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=115.08s)]
*  you know, the state of New Jersey, people's homes, even the president-elect's golf club, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=122.36s)]
*  and other important installations. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=128.88s)]
*  But let me be clear. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=130.16s)]
*  This is not a story about aliens. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=132.06s)]
*  This is not an extraterrestrial segment. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  Instead, this is a serious, alarming, potential national security threat that your government [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=137.88s)]
*  does not seem to care about at all or feel the need to explain in any way. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=145.6s)]
*  And that fails to get to the bottom of this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  The same people that tried to hide China's spy balloon—we learned about that later, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=154.72s)]
*  you know, well, it's probably from China, but let's not say anything and hope nobody [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=159.6s)]
*  notices. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  They let it fly all over the U.S., above key U.S. nuclear sites and military bases. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=164.0s)]
*  They're now saying—they're now doing nothing, absolutely nothing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  You can't make it up. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=177.08s)]
*  About the hundreds of low-flying objects lighting up the sky in the Northeast night after night [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=178.88s)]
*  after night. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  So, I don't know, are we under attack or about to be? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  Are we being spied on by a foreign adversary? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=191.12s)]
*  Is this a secret U.S. program? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  Is somebody collecting your personal data? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=196.56s)]
*  Is it a dry run for a future attack? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=199.6s)]
*  Who's controlling these objects? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  And we have no idea. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=204.92s)]
*  And maybe in the end—let me be very clear—maybe in the end, this turns out to be nothing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=206.88s)]
*  I actually hope that's true. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  But the fact that your government doesn't know and hasn't known now for weeks is chilling [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=214.38s)]
*  the apparent message from Joe Biden and Kamala and Mayorkas, even our own military, close [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=221.34s)]
*  your eyes and pretend like it's not happening. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=227.42s)]
*  Well, that's not going to secure our country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  And like a good Democratic stooge, New Jersey's idiotic governor, and he's an idiot, Phil [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=232.5s)]
*  Murphy, he seems happy to let it all play out despite all of the glaring concerns. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=237.94s)]
*  And him acknowledging it's scary, but nothing to be alarmed about. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=244.26s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=247.7s)]
*  These are apparently very—as I understand it—very sophisticated. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=248.7s)]
*  The minute you get eyes on them, they go dark. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=253.14s)]
*  And you know, we're obviously most concerned about sensitive targets and sensitive critical [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=257.38s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=264.02s)]
*  So we've got military assets, we've got utility assets, we've got the president-elect's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=265.02s)]
*  one of his homes here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=269.84s)]
*  This is something we're taking deadly seriously. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=271.7s)]
*  Yeah, but no reason for anybody to be really concerned. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=275.1s)]
*  While Phil Murphy does nothing, other elected officials, they are demanding answers. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=278.98s)]
*  The Biden administration, they are pretty short on details. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=284.1s)]
*  You decide. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=287.82000000000005s)]
*  That was an amateur hour presentation where they told us nothing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=288.82000000000005s)]
*  When I got here today, I was concerned about what I could tell my constituents to ease [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=292.18s)]
*  their concerns. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=296.18s)]
*  Now, I'm legitimately concerned. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=297.18s)]
*  The Colonel of State Police told us that he had one of his helicopters hovering above [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=298.98s)]
*  one of these drones, but felt unsafe for the pilots, so he let the drone go and had [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=303.1s)]
*  them come land. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=307.54s)]
*  We are not—the state police, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, they are not [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  doing what they need to do to figure out what the issue is. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=312.66s)]
*  Their answer to us was they don't have any answers, and they're not sure what's going on. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=315.38s)]
*  Since November the 18th, can't make it up. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=320.86s)]
*  Now, New Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew, he speculated these drones are from the number [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=323.70000000000005s)]
*  one state sponsor of terror, Iran, and do pose a very serious threat to our homeland. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  From very high sources, very qualified sources, very responsible sources, I'm going to tell [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  you the real deal. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=345.64s)]
*  Iran launched a mothership probably about a month ago that contains these drones. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=347.5s)]
*  That mothership is off—I'm going to tell you the deal. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=353.68s)]
*  So off the East Coast of the United States of America, they've launched drones. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=356.82s)]
*  It's everything that we can see or hear. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=361.1s)]
*  And again, these are from high sources. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=363.3s)]
*  I don't say this lightly. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  Now, today, the Department of Defense, they denied Van Drew's allegations, but they [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  wouldn't share any details. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  The DOD says they are aware of the drones, and that's pretty much it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=374.38s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=379.1s)]
*  End of story. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=380.1s)]
*  We also have a few details, you know, or few details or answers from anyone at the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=381.24s)]
*  FBI, the DHS, the Biden-Harris White House, or any other so-called public servant or national [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=387.2s)]
*  security official. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=393.26s)]
*  Apparently, under Biden, they don't really feel they need to answer you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=394.48s)]
*  They probably don't even know, which makes it even worse. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=399.0s)]
*  Under Biden, this is not a government by the people, for the people, of the people. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a shady cabal of all-powerful, unelected bureaucrats that don't really seem to give [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=408.08000000000004s)]
*  a damn if you are concerned or worried, and they're the ones that should be on top of this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=413.68s)]
*  Americans, we're entitled to answers. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=419.2s)]
*  If you have something the size of a bus flying all over the skies of our country, I think [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=422.36s)]
*  we need to know about that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  If they're flying over your homes, your businesses, I think we need to know. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  We deserve the answer. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=432.68s)]
*  It shouldn't take this long. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=434.8s)]
*  This is—they're supposed to work for us. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=436.74s)]
*  Thankfully, 40 days, well, a long national nightmare will be over. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  The games will stop. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=445.09999999999997s)]
*  There will be a reckoning. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=446.26s)]
*  And, by the way, if this is Iran, if this is an adversary, if this is China, if it is, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=447.26s)]
*  there will be held to pay. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=455.3s)]
*  That I can pretty much promise. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=456.78s)]
*  I haven't talked to Donald Trump, just a good guess. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=458.14s)]
*  And the left and their Orwellian style of government will be driven out of town. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huLZlB2birA&t=461.0s)]
