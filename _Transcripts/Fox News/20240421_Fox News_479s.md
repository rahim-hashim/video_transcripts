# Tim Scott: Mayorkas is 'guilty of the greatest invasion in American history'
**Fox News:** [April 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8)
*  All right, Joe Biden's weakness on the world stage is making the world less safe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=0.0s)]
*  He is emboldening the terror group Hamas and the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=6.0s)]
*  That would be Iran. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=11.64s)]
*  Now, in the Middle East, Biden now stands accused in a lawsuit of aiding and abetting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=12.64s)]
*  the Hamas terror attacks by funneling $1.5 billion to the West Bank and Gaza, despite [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=17.26s)]
*  Hamas being a designated terror organization. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=25.02s)]
*  Now, that is apparently in violation of the 2018 Taylor Force Act, which specifically [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  does restrict money from going to the Palestinians unless they are taking steps to end acts of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  violence against the U.S. and Israel and Israeli citizens. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=41.74s)]
*  Now Biden also refuses to hold Iran accountable for their attack on Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  He has no plans at all to issue any sanctions on the lifeblood of their terror organization, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=52.36s)]
*  which is money gained from Iranian oil, the lifeblood of the world's economy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=58.72s)]
*  And even worse, he won't support Israel's right to defend itself against these terror [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  attacks. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=68.32s)]
*  And he's now literally enabling Iran and Hamas, and by the way, by doing so, increasing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=69.32s)]
*  the likelihood of even more attacks. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=76.0s)]
*  Now, Biden also apparently has no issue with Russia aiding Iran. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=78.28s)]
*  According to reports, Russia is all but openly selling weapons to the Islamic Republic, even [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  from factories already facing U.S. sanctions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  And meanwhile, Biden has not said a word about Vladimir Putin moving a warship, apparently [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  with hypersonic weapons in them, into the Mediterranean this week. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  None of this should come as a surprise. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Biden can't even secure our very own border here at home. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=105.04s)]
*  By the way, earlier today, his secretary of homeland security paid the price for that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=108.8s)]
*  policy as articles of impeachment against him from the House were formally presented [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=114.0s)]
*  to the U.S. Senate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=119.64s)]
*  The question now is whether or not Senate Republicans will be able to hold the trial [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=120.64s)]
*  as we expect Chuck Schumer will move to dismiss the articles tomorrow. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=125.56s)]
*  South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, he was in the chamber for the delivery of those articles [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=129.8s)]
*  and he joins us right now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=135.0s)]
*  Senator, will 41 Republicans stand on principle and take the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=137.4s)]
*  who lied to the country for three years and said the country, that our border was secure [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=145.28s)]
*  and border was closed, lied to us, and we have over 10 million unvetted Joe Biden illegal [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=150.32s)]
*  immigrants, tens of thousands from Russia and China, and let's see, Iran and Syria [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=156.24s)]
*  and Egypt and Afghanistan. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=163.2s)]
*  Will the Senate, will the 41 Republicans stand on principle and say you should and must as [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=166.56s)]
*  a matter of your constitutional duties enforce the laws of this country? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=172.4s)]
*  1000%, Sean. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=178.56s)]
*  We absolutely, positively, unequivocally must stand for truth, stand for justice. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=181.6s)]
*  The Biden administration and Mayorkas, they are guilty. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=187.68s)]
*  Guilty, guilty of the greatest invasion in American history. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=192.68s)]
*  Our southern border, insecure, unsafe sleeper cells coming across our southern border. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  This is not just a crisis, it is a crime and the impeachment should stand and we should [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  fire Joe Biden in November and reelect. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  Yes, reelect. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=212.12s)]
*  Can you, let me ask this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=213.24s)]
*  Donald Trump, why? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=214.84s)]
*  Because we have peace, prosperity and opportunity. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  Yes, Sean. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  Okay, will 41 Republicans tomorrow unite to make sure that this trial goes forward? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=219.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  We had conversations today. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  I believe we will have a unanimous Republican party standing in defense of truth. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  The Democrats want this to be quick and painless. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  Republicans want this to be an exercise that is thorough, that finds the truth and brings [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  to the surface the absolute disaster of the Biden administration in paroling and jeopardizing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=248.36s)]
*  American lives. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  It is a national security issue. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=257.24s)]
*  Our border is a national security issue. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=259.88s)]
*  You watch now the radicalized Democratic party, the Chuck Schumers, the Nancy Pelosi, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=263.8s)]
*  the squad and Joe Biden now in Israel's hour of need. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=270.6s)]
*  1,200 Israelis killed on October the 7th. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=275.64s)]
*  This attack on Saturday night by Iran never happened in history. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=279.96s)]
*  It seems that Joe Biden's answer is he will not stand with our ally as they did stand [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=285.48s)]
*  with us after 9-11 and back them in winning their war against radical terrorists that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=291.72s)]
*  are attacking them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=299.16s)]
*  They are the victims here. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=300.2s)]
*  I think the reason is that Joe Biden is more concerned that he lost 100,000 Democratic [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=302.44s)]
*  primary voters in Michigan, 18.9% total. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=308.68s)]
*  He lost 50,000 in Wisconsin. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  It seems to me that Joe Biden would rather stand against Israel, which emboldens radical [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=316.12s)]
*  terrorists Hamas and Iran because his blind political ambition has taken over. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=323.48s)]
*  How do you see it? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=328.44s)]
*  1,000%, Sean, you can't say it better than you just said it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=329.24s)]
*  The bottom line is this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=334.6s)]
*  Joe Biden is more interested in winning elections than doing the right thing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden is willing to be effectless without question. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=340.36s)]
*  He is not loyal to our allies, which means he cannot be lethal to our adversaries. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=344.68s)]
*  It goes a step further, however. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=350.6s)]
*  It's not just the $1.5 billion given our flowing through UNRWA. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=353.16s)]
*  It's not just the $6 billion in exchange for hostages making the entire globe unsafe [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=357.64s)]
*  for Americans to travel. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=363.88s)]
*  It's not just the $10 billion in November. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  It's the more than $100 billion of sanction relief to oil. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=369.4s)]
*  So the president is actually complicit with the actions of this new axis of evil that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=373.88s)]
*  you described earlier. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=380.36s)]
*  But more importantly, we had a choice. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  And when we have another choice on November the 5th, the question should be answered emphatically. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  Our borders were more secure. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=391.08s)]
*  We had peace in the world, prosperity at home and opportunity across the world under Donald [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=393.0s)]
*  J. Trump. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=401.56s)]
*  That's why the trial in New York is absolutely injustice, not justice. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=402.84s)]
*  That's why Joe Biden is more afraid of the new growing anti-Semitism in his party. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  He's going to try his best to insulate them and leave the rest of us vulnerable. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  It's just wrong, Sean. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=422.12s)]
*  If Joe Biden had any moral clarity at all, and he does not, he would be telling Israel, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=423.24s)]
*  the United States will stand by you and wish you all the best and give you as much support [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=429.48s)]
*  and hope and pray that you win your war against radical terrorism. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  That should be the stand of the U.S. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=443.56s)]
*  That's not complicated. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=445.8s)]
*  Senator, great to have you. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=448.28s)]
*  Not at all, Sean. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=449.32s)]
*  Coming up next, Joe Biden traveled to Scranton, PA today to pitch his tax plan. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=451.88s)]
*  The whole thing was a typical Biden disaster. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=457.4s)]
*  We've got all the lowlights and reaction. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=461.4s)]
*  Larry Kudlow, straight ahead. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ps6aYNWv8&t=463.64s)]
