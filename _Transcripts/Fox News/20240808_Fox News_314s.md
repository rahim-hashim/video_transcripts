# Elisabeth Hasselbeck: This is an attack on the value of life
**Fox News:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o)
*  And tonight, Tim Walz's radical stances on abortion and gender issues are under scrutiny. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=0.0s)]
*  Just last year, he signed a bill allowing unlimited abortion access in the state of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=6.92s)]
*  Minnesota, which includes no limitations on when in the pregnancy a woman may have an [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=11.48s)]
*  abortion given the option of an abortion up until the moment of birth. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=17.1s)]
*  Radical, extreme, dangerous. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=23.0s)]
*  I keep reminding you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=25.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, just earlier this year, in a bizarre, unprecedented move, Kamala Harris became the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=26.96s)]
*  first sitting vice president to visit an abortion clinic when she stopped at a Planned Parenthood [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  clinic in Minnesota alongside her future running mate, Tim Walz. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=36.6s)]
*  And after a year of anger and fear mongering from the left following the Dobbs decision, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=41.2s)]
*  a new study found that the number of abortions has actually gone up since Roe has overturned. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  But it's not just abortion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=51.2s)]
*  The new Democratic Party ticket is taken an extreme stance on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  And just March of last year, Walz signed an executive order doing what? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=56.72s)]
*  Protecting trans procedures on minors. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=61.24s)]
*  And by the way, without parental consent. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=64.76s)]
*  Here with reaction, broadcaster, New York Times bestselling author Elizabeth Hasselback. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=67.92s)]
*  Elizabeth, let's get your take on all of it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=72.0s)]
*  Let's start with no parental notification on gender-affirming surgery and treatments. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=74.68s)]
*  Shawn, thank you for having me tonight and hello to all your viewers there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=82.16s)]
*  Number one, I'd like to say if we learn anything from the Olympics, Shawn, it's that performance [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=87.44s)]
*  matters. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=90.72s)]
*  And since the Kamala Harris and Walz ticket has no performance to run on because they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=91.72s)]
*  let cities burn down and our border be open and fentanyl and illegal weapons come in and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=96.24s)]
*  threaten our children, our teenagers, our college kids, why would we think they would [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  protect our children when it comes to their God-given identity or their right to life? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  It's low expectation when it comes to their radical riptide. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=110.44000000000001s)]
*  So that's what they're running on, a radical riptide hoping to drown voters so that they [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=112.84s)]
*  can't see nor breathe properly to cast a vote for anything that resembles an ounce of integrity. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=116.54s)]
*  Here's my issue, Shawn. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  This is an attack on parenthood. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  I would normally say take a breath, swim to the side out of the riptide and don't get [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=128.08s)]
*  emotionally distracted. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=132.32s)]
*  But this is an attack on the value of life. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=133.32s)]
*  And this is an important matter to God. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  This is God's creation, God's masterpiece. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=140.12s)]
*  Our children, preborn children and children out of the womb, to confuse them about their [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=142.84s)]
*  gender, God will handle that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=146.56s)]
*  He's sovereign. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  When it comes to abortion, and I do believe we need to keep an eye on the moderate Republican [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump vans ticket that right now just needs to kind of sit back and let crazy look [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=154.62s)]
*  crazy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=159.24s)]
*  They're doing that enough. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=160.24s)]
*  But it is important to note that not only are they creating a force field behind more [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=161.56s)]
*  abortions in their state. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=167.72s)]
*  I read some research today that 5,000 women who went into have an abortion said they just [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=169.8s)]
*  didn't feel like having another child. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=173.8s)]
*  They will highlight situations that seem extreme. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=175.72s)]
*  But at the same time, Shawn, what's deeply concerning is that they're defunding pregnancy [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=178.72s)]
*  centers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=182.8s)]
*  These centers are ones that I've worked with on a national level that actually comfort [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=183.8s)]
*  women, don't cast shame on them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  When they find themselves in a situation with an unplanned pregnancy, unexpected pregnancy, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=188.88s)]
*  they provide them sustainable support and equip them to have an awesome, peace-filled [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=193.96s)]
*  life with their child because God cares about both the mom and the child and they have options [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  and support. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm deeply saddened that this is increasing, but not surprised that the radical agenda [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=204.08s)]
*  is running on this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  Shawn, they're just not supporting it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=212.08s)]
*  They're running on this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  Actually, they should fear the day they meet their own maker. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=215.12s)]
*  I would love to know of Wall's wife if she took prenatal vitamins at any point. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  Do they value life in the womb as they should? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  It has a value. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=224.44s)]
*  I mean, it's an amazing creation by God with a plan and a purpose. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=225.44s)]
*  And if there's a woman out there who needs to know that she's valued without shame, she [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=228.04s)]
*  should go to these pregnancy centers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  And Americans watching, if you feel like there's nothing you can do, go support them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=234.38s)]
*  Go donate to the pregnancy centers that he's defunding in his state and put some money [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=238.16s)]
*  behind them because they're doing good things in supporting women. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=244.16s)]
*  Our family has decided to walk this out in a different way. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=247.8s)]
*  We have taken in, and it's been a blessing to us, newborns who would have otherwise potentially [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=251.0s)]
*  been aborted. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=256.24s)]
*  But they found, their moms found pregnancy centers that supported them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=257.36s)]
*  And for the first month of life, that mom just needs to know that there's support, there's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=260.68s)]
*  sustainability with the plan, that there are loving arms to hold her baby. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=264.2s)]
*  And maybe she's reunited in some cases and maybe that baby is placed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=267.76s)]
*  But there are options out there that this radical riptide wants eliminated and we need [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=271.44s)]
*  to stand for our children. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=275.12s)]
*  You know, it's just sad. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=277.92s)]
*  I mean, OK, up to the moment of birth, talk about radical and abortion, no parental rights [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=279.12s)]
*  on something as serious as that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=284.68s)]
*  By the way, for the record, I think that was more interrupted talk time that you had than [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=286.76s)]
*  all your years combined on The View. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=292.36s)]
*  I'm just saying, without somebody jumping in and annoying you and annoying anybody that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=294.32s)]
*  was watching. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=298.32s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us, Elizabeth Hasselbeck. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=299.76s)]
*  Most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQPz5zg50o&t=309.12s)]
