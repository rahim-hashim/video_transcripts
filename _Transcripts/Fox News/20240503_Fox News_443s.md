# Ron DeSantis: If you try this in Florida, you'll get expelled
**Fox News:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE)
*  All right, as anti-Israel protests continue on college campuses all around the country, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=0.0s)]
*  two states have shown the nation how to handle radical leftists properly. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=4.48s)]
*  That'd be Texas and Florida, both free states. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=8.52s)]
*  In the Sunshine State, Governor Ron DeSantis called the protesters at schools like Yale [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=11.92s)]
*  and Columbia, quote, absurd. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=16.88s)]
*  Let everyone know, quote, if you try that at a Florida university, you are going to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=19.04s)]
*  be expelled. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=25.04s)]
*  Now, Governor DeSantis is also now taking a stand against men competing in women's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=26.68s)]
*  sports. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  He is now suing the Biden administration over their changes to Title IX that would protect, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=32.76s)]
*  quote, gender identity rather than biological sex. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=37.4s)]
*  All right, joining us now is the governor of the great state of Florida, my state of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=41.12s)]
*  Florida. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Oh, I am a full-time domiciled resident since January in the free state of Florida, Governor, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  and I got to applaud you because the reason it's not happening in your state is because [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=53.32s)]
*  you have no moral ambiguity. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=58.24s)]
*  You laid down the law. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=60.92s)]
*  That's the end of that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=62.36s)]
*  You want to act like these idiots at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, FIT, NYU, UCLA, USC? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=63.44s)]
*  Don't do it in Florida. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=71.92s)]
*  It's not going to work out well for you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=73.08s)]
*  Well, that's right, Sean. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=75.08s)]
*  I mean, in a variety of ways, Florida is not California, not New York on all hosts of issues, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=78.08s)]
*  but particularly on how you handle these universities. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=84.24s)]
*  And these students that think they can set up an encampment or take over buildings, they [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  don't have a right to do that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  And they will be held accountable in Florida. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=93.88s)]
*  What I see in places like Columbia and Harvard and the California schools is the administrators, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=95.96s)]
*  the presidents, these universities are just too weak to do anything about it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=102.52s)]
*  Maybe they agree with what's going on, but there's no consequences. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=107.32s)]
*  And so when there's no consequences, you're going to continue to see that conduct. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=111.24s)]
*  I can tell you in Florida, there will be consequences. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  We are not running daycare centers at our universities. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=119.44s)]
*  We're running universities and people are there to learn and their people are there [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  to better themselves. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=126.32s)]
*  We're not going to sit there and have tents spring up all around our university campuses. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=128.2s)]
*  It's unacceptable. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=132.64s)]
*  Let me ask you about the Biden administration and their attempt to revise Title IX and the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=135.24s)]
*  fact that Florida will sue the Biden administration over this, what you are calling an unlawful [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=141.08s)]
*  change. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=147.08s)]
*  Now, they would redefine sex as gender identity and sexual orientation, while also requiring [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=148.08s)]
*  schools to ensure that students use preferred pronouns. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=154.84s)]
*  Now, let me see if I have this straight. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  So, the Biden administration is upset about the use of the preferred pronoun, but they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  don't have the moral clarity to understand that the murder of how many Israelis on October [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=167.52s)]
*  7th and the beheadings and the rapes and the kidnappings, they've been very hesitant [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=174.68s)]
*  to take a strong stand on that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  I find that comparison pretty remarkable. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=183.8s)]
*  They don't get triggered by October 7th, but they're certainly triggered by the use of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=187.52s)]
*  a wrong pronoun. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=191.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're twisting themselves into pretzels, and I think it's because they're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=192.08s)]
*  trying to placate the woke left-wing mob because Biden thinks he needs those voters for his [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=199.16000000000003s)]
*  upcoming election. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=206.84s)]
*  But the reality is that he's shown no leadership in the aftermath of October 7th. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  We know that when he condemns anti-Semitism, he talks about kind of the both sides type [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  of deal, which is not the clarity that you need. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=220.24s)]
*  But on this Title IX, we in Florida are not going to allow the federal government to inject [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=222.88s)]
*  men into women's bathrooms and women's locker rooms. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=230.12s)]
*  We do not believe and we will not accept the idea that boys should be allowed to compete [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=234.16s)]
*  against girls and take away opportunities and things like athletics, which is the next [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=240.24s)]
*  thing that they're going to try to shove down the state's throat. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=244.4s)]
*  So we have said very clearly we are not going to comply with this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=247.56s)]
*  We are fighting back, of course, in court. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=252.4s)]
*  I don't recall Congress ever passing a law along these lines. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=255.12s)]
*  It's just Biden using the bureaucracy to try to impose his vision. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=258.48s)]
*  But it's clearly bad for girls and bad for women at our schools and at our universities. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=262.8s)]
*  And so we're saying no, Joe, we're not going to do it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=270.12s)]
*  Governor, let me ask you about your recent meeting with President Trump, which I was [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=273.48s)]
*  glad to see, to be very honest, from the very beginning. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=279.48s)]
*  And I had said it often publicly that I did not like the contentious battle that had emerged [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=282.52s)]
*  between two former friends and allies. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=288.44s)]
*  I didn't like it one bit. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=290.44s)]
*  I am glad that you both got together. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=292.8s)]
*  Whatever you feel like sharing, share. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm sure there's probably part of it that you, you know, was, I guess, confidential [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=298.35999999999996s)]
*  between the two of you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=303.32s)]
*  Well, look, yeah, I mean, I, you know, back in January, I endorsed him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=304.32s)]
*  I think it's really important that we win this election. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=310.88s)]
*  And I reiterated that to him. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, we're going to be active in a variety of capacities throughout the rest of the year [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=316.32s)]
*  for to help, you know, not just the top of the ticket, but all around the country and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=320.67999999999995s)]
*  particularly in Florida with some of the key issues we have to deal with. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=325.36s)]
*  But, you know, a lot of it was just connecting about things. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=327.88s)]
*  I mean, look, he's a dad. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=331.0s)]
*  He's got a kid going to college. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=332.0s)]
*  You know, I'm a dad. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  I've got three young kids in the household. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  He's concerned about how my wife was doing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=337.32s)]
*  Obviously, she had a cancer scare a couple of years ago. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=339.36s)]
*  So it was just a good meeting and a good conversation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=343.24s)]
*  But he understands the importance of this election. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=346.56s)]
*  He understands the damage that Biden is doing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=350.04s)]
*  And I think you would see 180 degree different policies if we're able to win in November, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=353.52s)]
*  which is important that we do. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=359.96s)]
*  Last question. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=362.44s)]
*  The issue of abortion and the legalization of marijuana will be on the ballot in Florida. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=363.44s)]
*  I see that the Democrats want to demagogue the issue of abortion as much as possible. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=369.48s)]
*  Do you think those two issues in any way have any impact on the state of Florida in terms [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=374.32s)]
*  of the vote in 24? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=378.72s)]
*  No. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=382.24s)]
*  But I think both of those need to be defeated. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=383.24s)]
*  The recreational marijuana is the most broad non-medical marijuana. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=386.0s)]
*  It would be everywhere. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=392.0s)]
*  The state would smell like it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=393.52s)]
*  We don't need that in Florida. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=395.16s)]
*  The abortion amendment would be the most radical abortion regime in the world. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=396.92s)]
*  It eliminates parental consent for minors. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=401.2s)]
*  It allows abortion up until birth and doesn't even require a physician to be involved. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=404.32s)]
*  So vote no on both of those. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=408.76s)]
*  But I think regardless of how those turn out, Republicans are going to carry the day in [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=410.84s)]
*  Florida pretty significantly. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=414.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=416.28s)]
*  By the way, I just left a state that everywhere you go, that's all you smell. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=417.44s)]
*  That's one of the great things about Florida. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=423.56s)]
*  I get to breathe free air. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=425.36s)]
*  Anyway, Governor, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=427.36s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd1BITC5uWE&t=430.64s)]
