# James Carville: Offering tampons to students is one of the best ideas I've heard
**Fox News:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To)
*  Now, one person I did speak to about Kamala and her own words is my old friend, James [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=0.0s)]
*  Carville, about the state of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=4.72s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=6.96s)]
*  James Carville, sir—you know what it's like—you know, when I tell people on my [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=8.68s)]
*  radio show, I actually—I'm friends with James Carville. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=13.36s)]
*  How many debates have we done around the country together? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=17.48s)]
*  We did a debate— [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=20.18s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=21.18s)]
*  Tim Russert once moderated—was that not a great day? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=22.18s)]
*  We had a great time? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=25.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=26.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=27.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=28.0s)]
*  Let's start it and get down to the nitty-gritty. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=29.0s)]
*  I just want to say something. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=30.96s)]
*  I respect your longevity and your relevance. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=32.24s)]
*  I may not agree with you, but I've seen a lot of pretenders and a lot of contenders [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=35.88s)]
*  come through Fox News over this century, and no one has been more relevant and survived [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  more—longer than you have. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=46.0s)]
*  So, my— [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't know what that meant. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Unless you had to talk to you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  No, I—look, I appreciate it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Proceed with the questions. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  But we've also—we've also had fun, but we don't agree. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  We just don't. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=56.5s)]
*  And—but I will say this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=57.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  For example, I'm going to play a clip. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  Bill and Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=63.52s)]
*  Okay? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=64.76s)]
*  And this is them talking about abortion. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=65.76s)]
*  And I won't play it, but they also—you know, Bill Clinton famously said, the era [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=68.72s)]
*  of big government is over, the end of welfare as we know it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  But here's Bill and Hillary on abortion. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  And as I ask it, keep in mind that neither Tim Walz or Kamala Harris want any restrictions [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  on abortion at all—none whatsoever—that in the case of Walz, I mean, he wants gender [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  affirming care provided to children without parental consent, and he wanted to put feminine [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=88.64s)]
*  hygiene products in boys' bathrooms in schools. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=95.04s)]
*  Listen, but here's Bill and Hillary. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=98.56s)]
*  Our vision—our vision should be of an America where abortion is safe and legal, but rare. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=100.24s)]
*  I have worked for, for many years, is to make abortion safe, legal and rare. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  Our people have genuine and deeply felt differences on the subject of abortion, even if abortion [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=114.8s)]
*  is safe, legal and rare. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=121.36s)]
*  Well, I believe abortion should be safe, legal and rare. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=123.52s)]
*  So we've known each other all this time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't see James Carville as a radical Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, Bernie Sanders, left-wing, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=131.96s)]
*  you know, lunatic. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=141.44s)]
*  And you kind of said as much yourself. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=143.62s)]
*  I mean, if the country knows who they really are, can they win? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=145.26s)]
*  Well, certainly they can win. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=149.26s)]
*  And I agree with everything that President and Mrs. Clinton said. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  I think abortion should be safe, legal, and hopefully it'll be rare. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=155.06s)]
*  And if we have aggressive contraception and aggressive availability, we can do that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=158.82s)]
*  You know, actually, abortion rate—the number of abortions has gone up since this idiotic [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  decision. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=169.5s)]
*  And I think that Roe v. Wade is right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=171.3s)]
*  It takes into account certain rights in the first trimester, certain rights in the second, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=173.78s)]
*  certain rights in the third trimester. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  And I will disagree with you vehemently and friendly on one thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  I think offering tampons to students is one of the best ideas I've ever heard. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=183.06s)]
*  You know, Utah— [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=188.3s)]
*  To boys in the bath—to boys' bathrooms? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=189.3s)]
*  They said there'd be tampons—it had nothing to do with to boys in the bathroom. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=191.5s)]
*  That's not something that's made up in five. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=196.22s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  It changed the language. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  There should be young people who are going through—embarrassing enough to be a young [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  girl to have to go through this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=211.26s)]
*  I am wholeheartedly for that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=213.22s)]
*  I don't care if they put it in the library or whatever they put it in. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=214.82s)]
*  You want it now in the library? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  I really don't want to get into that argument. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm really for it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  Yes, I don't care where it is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  But you're good—but wait a minute. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  You and Mary are good parents. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  You and these young people— [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  You love your kids. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  You love your kids. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  Would you want gender-affirming care without you being consultant? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=228.22s)]
*  I don't—I would—we'll make those decisions. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=231.22s)]
*  I don't really think about that very often. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=236.22000000000003s)]
*  I think that Governor Rhodes is a patriot. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=240.22000000000003s)]
*  I think he's a soldier. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=242.22000000000003s)]
*  I think he's a football coach. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=243.22000000000003s)]
*  He's a hunter. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=244.22000000000003s)]
*  He's done some tremendous things. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=245.22000000000003s)]
*  And we're going to sit here and nitpick every little thing he did. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=248.22000000000003s)]
*  Nitpick? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=251.22000000000003s)]
*  And this and that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=252.22000000000003s)]
*  And I'm very comfortable with tampons being offered free to students in school. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  I'm totally 100 percent for that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=259.86s)]
*  All right, so let's not belabor the point. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=262.86s)]
*  You're okay with it in boys' bathrooms. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=264.36s)]
*  You have no problem with it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=265.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=266.86s)]
*  Gender-affirming care, forget— [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=267.86s)]
*  Okay, I like it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=268.86s)]
*  Put it in the cafeteria for all I care. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=269.86s)]
*  Okay, let me ask you this. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=272.86s)]
*  We've got to have the courage to stop using the term radical Islamic terrorism and illegal [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=274.36s)]
*  alien. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=279.16s)]
*  Let me play it for you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=280.16s)]
*  We must have the courage to object when they use that term radical Islamic terrorism, which [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=282.1s)]
*  more than the greatest victims of terror. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=293.1s)]
*  And we must also have the courage to reject that term illegal alien. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=299.1s)]
*  I have seen some of the worst of criminal behavior. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=312.1s)]
*  I have seen the worst of crime. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=315.1s)]
*  An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=318.1s)]
*  Do you think that's a little out of the mainstream to not say radical Islamic terrorism or illegal [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=322.1s)]
*  aliens? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=328.1s)]
*  Who attacked us on 9-11? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=329.1s)]
*  Who's entering our country illegally? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=330.1s)]
*  Well, okay, let's back up. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=333.1s)]
*  In the last shootings in Buffalo, in Martin Sonam Douglas, the people—the guy that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=337.04s)]
*  shot at the president, Donald Trump, all of these shootings have something in common. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  They all about white males who could get an assault weapon. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=347.0s)]
*  I'd rather use the term radical terrorists. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=350.36s)]
*  I would prefer to leave the term Islamic out of it, because there are so many, many good [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  people who follow the religion of Islam. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  And I wouldn't want to do anything that would bring any discomfort. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=363.18s)]
*  But the word radical delineates. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=366.18s)]
*  In the post of the term— [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=368.18s)]
*  The word radical delineates between Muslims and radical Islamists. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=369.18s)]
*  That's very clear. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=374.18s)]
*  I would just say radical terrorists, but that's something I'd prefer. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=375.18s)]
*  All right, that's you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=380.18s)]
*  Rather, I would call someone—I don't think any human being is illegal. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=381.18s)]
*  But I do think you should have more laws. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=388.18s)]
*  I wouldn't mind saying that they're undocumented. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=391.72s)]
*  But I just wouldn't call another human being an alien. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=393.72s)]
*  That's just—maybe that's too Catholic in me. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=398.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=401.72s)]
*  But I don't like the term alien applied to another human being. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=402.72s)]
*  By the way, the term illegal alien happens to be a government term, the one that they [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=407.72s)]
*  put in all their government documents. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PwVFFwY6To&t=413.72s)]
