*  And welcome to Hannity. It is nine o'clock on the East Coast and 8 p.m. Right here in the great city of Milwaukee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti138nIRvAY&t=0.0s)]
*  We are in beautiful, Wisconsin and we are broadcasting live from inside the RNC now the Republican National Convention [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti138nIRvAY&t=6.24s)]
*  Will go on as planned after a day that Americans will never forget [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti138nIRvAY&t=13.64s)]
*  Donald Trump standing tall blood running down his face [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti138nIRvAY&t=18.6s)]
