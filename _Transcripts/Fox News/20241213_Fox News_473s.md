# Hannity: Biden’s last act is ‘sabotaging’ incoming Trump admin
**Fox News:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k)
*  Good news. In less than two months, the greatest political comeback in American history, it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=0.0s)]
*  will be official. Joe Biden, along with his entire pathetic administration, they will [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=6.5s)]
*  be out of the White House and not a moment, frankly, too soon. After trying to put his [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=11.34s)]
*  chief political rival in prison with a weaponized DOJ, Biden will hand over the keys to Donald [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=16.3s)]
*  Trump, whether they like it or not, and leave office as the worst, most corrupt, most incompetent [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=22.7s)]
*  most divisive one term president in modern American history. And his final act as commander [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=30.14s)]
*  in chief, well, is very much on brand. Instead of working to make the country a better place [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=36.7s)]
*  in his final days in office, Joe Biden is solely focused on sabotaging the incoming [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=42.7s)]
*  Trump administration while also making some very dumb and frankly, even dangerous decisions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=48.32s)]
*  Now, that doesn't seem to make any sense at all to anybody. Does it? Except them. All [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  vengeance. Now, for example, according to reports, Biden is now trying to quickly offload [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=59.28s)]
*  construction materials that you paid for that were to be used for the border wall that they [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  stopped building. They're selling him at really low discount prices. What does that mean? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=70.8s)]
*  That will force the incoming administration to spend more of your money to buy the new [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=77.0s)]
*  materials to complete the wall that Donald Trump says he's going to complete. And he [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=82.04s)]
*  will complete. He thinks he's hurting Trump. What all he's really doing here is wasting [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=87.4s)]
*  your money, all of it, spiteful vengeance. At the same time, Biden just made it easier [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=93.2s)]
*  for illegal immigrants during his final weeks in office, allowing them to bypass in-person [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=99.76s)]
*  ICE check-ins with a new app. And according to reports, he is now letting in as many [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=105.68s)]
*  illegal immigrants, unvetted, of course, as possible to thwart the Trump agenda. What, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=111.72s)]
*  more murderers, rapists, cartel members, gang members? Huh, let's see. More drug dealers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=118.56s)]
*  Is that what he's doing? More terrorists? And now not only is our southern border a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=126.4s)]
*  disaster, but illegal crossings from Canada, they too are skyrocketing. And you have hundreds [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=131.36s)]
*  of terrorist suspects that have been arrested. Biden is not only leaving Trump with wide-open [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=137.56s)]
*  borders, but he is creating the greatest national security nightmare danger to all of you, and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=142.16s)]
*  that's waiting to happen. I hope it doesn't. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=150.04s)]
*  Overseas, Biden is actively sabotaging Donald Trump's upcoming peace efforts. He knows that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump wants negotiated settlements in the Middle East. He knows he wants them in Europe. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=158.9s)]
*  He's supplying now Joe Biden as Ukraine with long-range missiles and escalating a conflict [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=163.96s)]
*  that pretty much has long been a stalemate. He also, by the way, pumped another 20 billion [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=170.12s)]
*  of your hard-earned tax dollars, your money, into Ukraine to help prolong this conflict. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=175.36s)]
*  Now, since the fall of the Soviet Union, we have never been this close to a nuclear war. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=181.24s)]
*  Even Vladimir Putin changed his nuclear policy because of the weapons that Joe Biden is giving [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=187.0s)]
*  Zelensky in Ukraine. But Democrats, they're also now attempting to pass legislation to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=193.24s)]
*  limit Trump's authorization of America's nuclear arsenal. By the way, that would be clearly [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=199.12s)]
*  unconstitutional. And meanwhile, in the Middle East, the U.S. is currently targeting Syria [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=205.68s)]
*  with a barrage of airstrikes after U.S.-backed rebel groups toppled Assad, and there are [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=210.96s)]
*  now fears that ISIS might take power. Joe, take the next 30 to eight days off, go to the beach. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=217.36s)]
*  You're doing more harm than good. And back at home, Biden's chief of staff, well, is openly [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  encouraging the administration in their last 38 days to spend as much money as possible in their [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=230.8s)]
*  final weeks in order to fund woke projects and leave Donald Trump even with even more burdensome [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  debt. But that's not Donald Trump's debt. That's your children's debt and your grandchildren's debt. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=244.4s)]
*  And over at the DOJ, a watchdog was, quote, struck by the sheer magnitude of new hires [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  as the Biden administration is trying to, quote, Trump-proof the DOJ by hiring permanent [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=257.6s)]
*  appointees to some federal positions. And of course, the White House is trying to ram through [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=264.88s)]
*  federal judges at a record pace. And Joe is also now reportedly considering preemptive pardons for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  many of his friends in the Washington swamp. That would include people you know, Hillary Clinton, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=276.24s)]
*  Liz Cheney, Dr. Anthony Fauci. Benny Thompson is begging to be on the list as well. Now, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=281.84s)]
*  he and Liz Cheney were on the January 6th committee. Are they trying to hide something? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=289.28s)]
*  Did they lie? Did they commit any crimes in that sham January 6th committee with a predetermined [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=295.36s)]
*  outcome? But we're supposed to believe that the people that raided Trump's house spied on his [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=301.36s)]
*  communications, indicted him on, what, nearly a hundred cooked up felonies as he was running for [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=306.48s)]
*  president. Now, all of a sudden, they're worried about a weaponized DOJ? Hmm. Maybe they fear [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=312.56s)]
*  what they did to Donald Trump and others. Maybe they're fearing that will be done to them. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=321.28s)]
*  I don't think it should be, but probably that's what they're thinking. The hypocrisy, duplicity [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=327.52s)]
*  from the Biden administration is almost, it's believable, but almost unbelievable. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, this might be the most dishonest, the least transparent White House in American history. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=338.88s)]
*  So the drone or flying object or the thing that people describe as a big bus that sounds like a [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=345.2s)]
*  Harley story that emerged this week is right on par. There are now hundreds, maybe even thousands [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=351.28s)]
*  of credible accounts. There's plenty of videos, plenty of pictures showing these very large, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=358.64s)]
*  very sophisticated objects flying at very low altitudes over the U.S. In fact, New Jersey [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=364.4s)]
*  Senator Andy Kim went with local law enforcement last night. He filmed it himself. He put it on X. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=371.68s)]
*  We saw a few that looked like they were moving in small clusters of two to four. Now, we clearly [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  saw several that would move horizontally and then immediately switch back in the opposite direction [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=385.84s)]
*  in maneuvers that planes just can't do. Then he continued, officers said that they tried to get a [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  closer look with a helicopter, but that the drones would turn off their lights and go dark if [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=398.4s)]
*  approached. Even, well, he's not the smartest guy in the world, but even their governor in New Jersey [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=404.8s)]
*  finally reached out to the Biden administration and demanded more concrete information. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=409.44s)]
*  The first sighting was November the 18th, but so far the Biden White House is still pretending [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=415.76s)]
*  not to have any answers at all whatsoever and even suggested that nothing is actually happening. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=421.36s)]
*  Make no mistake, something's going on. The administration, in all likelihood, knows what [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=428.16s)]
*  it is and if they don't know, that would trouble me even more. That would be downright scary and if [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=434.32s)]
*  they're lying, well, that would just be par for the course. So let's assume they're lying, you know, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=442.24s)]
*  to our faces because, well, they don't value or respect the American people and that is exactly [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=448.24s)]
*  why Democrats got wiped out in November and why Biden is now considered probably the worst [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=454.32s)]
*  president in the modern era. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PxNL3bXz1k&t=459.44s)]
