# Our enemies see this weakness, GOP representative warns
**Fox News:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ)
*  Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, James Comer, along with Congressman Ronnie [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Jackson and Congressman Byron Donalds. Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=4.32s)]
*  Congressman Jackson, let me start with you. What did you make of President Biden's comments [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=10.16s)]
*  today? Did that reassure you and the people of Texas and around the country that, hey, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  he's on top of it? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=21.64s)]
*  No, it's absolutely pathetic, Jason. I mean, that kind of weakness portrayed and demonstrated [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=22.64s)]
*  on the national scale or national stage like it was today from the White House by our commander [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=28.12s)]
*  in chief and our head of state. It does everything. It makes this place incredibly dangerous. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you can see the dangerous times that we live in right now. But honestly, our enemies [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=38.96s)]
*  watch this. They see this weakness. And we are at great risk for the next 17 days. We [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=43.72s)]
*  need to move on. We need to get this man out of office. He had no business being our president [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=49.6s)]
*  and our commander in chief from day one. He's progressively gotten worse. And we would be [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=53.4s)]
*  better off as a nation right now if they would just put him in the basement for the next [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=58.0s)]
*  17 days and not put him on TV anymore. He does not inspire confidence. It's a dangerous [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  situation. And I think that bad things are on the horizon. I hope that we can get President [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=67.28s)]
*  Trump in place before some of it becomes a reality. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=73.64s)]
*  Yeah, putting getting President Trump there can happen soon enough. I think our enemies [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=77.68s)]
*  will fear us and our allies will respect us and America will be safer. Congressman Donalds, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  I want to ask you, though, I don't know how you feel, but I was offended that President [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=89.08s)]
*  Biden gave one of the second highest medal of honor. It's not called the Medal of Honor, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=93.84s)]
*  but a medal honoring these two congressmen, Congressman Liz Cheney and Benny Thompson. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=99.8s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=107.4s)]
*  My reaction is I'm highly offended, but I'm not surprised. Joe Biden and his White [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=109.78s)]
*  House have lived in the bizarro land where no other Americans really exist. That's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=115.04s)]
*  why the presidency under Joe Biden has been an abject disaster. This is just one of the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=120.22s)]
*  last pieces of icing on that cake. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=124.58s)]
*  Look, everybody knows that the fake January 6th committee, the only purpose was to basically [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  put a lot of propaganda out into the information stream to go after and attack Donald Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=133.22s)]
*  It failed, completely backfired. They suppressed information. They tampered with evidence. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=139.5s)]
*  There's reports out there that they were actually tampering with witnesses sitting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=145.42s)]
*  in front of that committee, something that has frankly never happened in the halls of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=149.38s)]
*  Congress happened with this J-6 committee. So for them to be rewarded for, frankly, the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=152.94s)]
*  lack of transparency and honesty they gave to the American people is disgusting. But [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=159.18s)]
*  Why are we surprised? This is the presidency of Joe Biden, the very worst presidency in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=164.94s)]
*  the history of our country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=170.5s)]
*  Chairman Comer, same question to you, because the way that committee acted, the way they [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=172.02s)]
*  excluded Republicans, excluded the speaker's ability to appoint Republicans to participate [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=180.10000000000002s)]
*  in it, the charade that they put it on, the Hollywood dressing that they put on this to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=186.5s)]
*  try to take down Donald Trump and rely on some information that was just, I just can't [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=191.78s)]
*  believe that President Biden would do this at this time. But what's your reaction to it? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=197.54s)]
*  Well, it's a slap in the face to all the good Americans who actually deserve to be recognized [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=203.06s)]
*  for their public service or for their sacrifice or for their community activism. You think [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=208.26s)]
*  about all the first responders that risk their lives every day, all the military, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=214.58s)]
*  frontline soldiers who risk their lives every day, all the people that run charitable [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=220.5s)]
*  organizations and do good things at church. None of them got recognized by Joe Biden, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  but he recognized Liz Cheney and Benny Thompson. And I want to remind everyone, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=231.94s)]
*  touching on what Byron Donald said, every committee in the history of Congress is appointed [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  by the speaker and minority leader. The majority party appoints their members, the minority party [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=242.82s)]
*  appoints their members. Kevin McCarthy appointed good members to that committee, but Nancy Pelosi [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=248.9s)]
*  rejected them because she knew they would be truthful and they wouldn't go along with the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=255.22s)]
*  false narrative that the media and the Democrats were trying to create about Donald Trump. So she [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=259.46s)]
*  kicked Jim Jordan and Jim Banks off and put Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger on there who would just [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=265.3s)]
*  go along with all the fake propaganda that the Democrat National Committee and their friends [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=271.86s)]
*  in the left-wing media were spouting out. All right, Congressman, I'm going to ask all three [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=277.06s)]
*  of you. So we're going to start with Congressman Jackson. He gets to go first again. You're about [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=283.06s)]
*  15 hours away from a speaker vote. How are you going to vote on that speaker vote? And I mean, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=287.86s)]
*  by my count, there's like five House members who aren't going to vote for Speaker Johnson, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=295.06s)]
*  and that's going to put you short of coming up over the majority. So foreshadow what's going to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=301.78s)]
*  happen and how specifically do you plan to vote, at least on the first round on Speaker Johnson? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=306.42s)]
*  Because that says 15 hours away. Well, I'm absolutely positively voting for Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=312.26s)]
*  He's done a good job under the circumstances. We need to get this, we need to move the ball right [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=317.7s)]
*  now. President Trump has stepped out and said, let's put Mike back in the speaker's role so we [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=322.5s)]
*  can move on with the Make America Great agenda and what the American people have told us that they [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  want us to do. We have to do that now. There's no time to mess around. It's time to, it's time to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=331.3s)]
*  put on our game faces and get it done. And I think that I hope that these people you're talking [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=335.62s)]
*  about, I hope that if they do vote against him, it's just a protest vote. We can get past that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=339.62s)]
*  We can come together as a conference because we will not win, Jason, unless we come together as a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  team. It's one team, one fight right now. We've got the House, we've got the Senate, and we've [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=348.42s)]
*  got the presidency coming up. We've got to take advantage of this. We may never get another chance. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=352.5s)]
*  Congressman Donalds. Oh, I'm voting for Mike Johnson. I agree with Ronnie Jackson. Look, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=358.5s)]
*  I think this thing's going to be wrapped up pretty quickly. So, you know, everybody's getting [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=363.62s)]
*  excited about tomorrow. I think this thing's going to get wrapped up and then we move forward. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=367.62s)]
*  I hope you're right, because if you don't get the speaker in place, you can't certify the election. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=372.82s)]
*  If you can't certify the election, you can't instill Donald Trump as the president on January [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=377.54s)]
*  20th. So I want to see who, what congressmen stand up and what argument that they make that they're [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=382.42s)]
*  going to go against Trump. And they much rather delay the implementation of, you know, the new [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=386.74s)]
*  presidency. That would be fascinating to me. Congressman Comer, Chairman Comer, where are you [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=391.22s)]
*  at on this? I'm voting for Mike Johnson. The people in my district sent a message that they [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=396.82000000000005s)]
*  want me to support President Trump's agenda. He won by more than a three to one margin in my [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=404.02000000000004s)]
*  congressional district. And that's what I'm going to do. Donald Trump wants Mike Johnson. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=410.66s)]
*  I'm voting for Mike Johnson. And let's get ready to make America great again. We've got a lot of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=414.02000000000004s)]
*  work to do. We've got a big mess to clean up left behind by Joe Biden and the Democrats. And it's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=418.26s)]
*  time to work with Trump to get things on track again. Yeah, it is a team sport, folks. And there's [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=423.06s)]
*  one team and there's another team. So if you're not united, your team ain't going to win. So [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=431.7s)]
*  Congressman, three of our best serving in the House of Representatives. Thanks for joining us here. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=436.26s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXpKHoWTeQ&t=448.26s)]
