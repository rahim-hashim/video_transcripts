# What did Hunter Biden's laptop really reveal about the family?
**Fox News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E)
*  All right, we continue live. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=0.0s)]
*  We're at the Capitol. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=2.6s)]
*  We have a quick report about former President Joe Biden. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=4.0s)]
*  In the closing moments of the administration, Biden issued sweeping, preemptive pardons [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=7.68s)]
*  for his family and his friends, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, General Mark Milley, Liz [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=12.6s)]
*  Cheney, Adam Schiff, as if in Schiff Show. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=18.64s)]
*  And of course, you missed that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=23.36s)]
*  We mentioned every single one of Joe's siblings, which begs the question, what exactly did [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=26.56s)]
*  Joe think that the people would be prosecuted for, and what was he trying to hide? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, where's the outrage from the left and the state-run legacy media mob? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=37.36s)]
*  They sure were singing a very different tune when the thought was out there that Donald [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=42.46s)]
*  Trump may do preemptive pardons. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=46.46s)]
*  Let's take a little trip in the Capitol down memory lane, shall we? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=48.76s)]
*  Have you ever heard of somebody getting a preemptive pardon who was innocent of all [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=53.34s)]
*  crime, who's just an innocent person? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=57.900000000000006s)]
*  Have you ever heard of that, just somebody getting a blanket pardon and they're an innocent [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=60.220000000000006s)]
*  person? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  But no. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=64.9s)]
*  Here, it's an effort not only to prospectively pardon people for things they have not yet [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=65.9s)]
*  been charged with and may never be charged with, but also it's the president's own family. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=71.42s)]
*  Presidents reportedly asking his staff whether he can issue preemptive pardons for himself, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=77.9s)]
*  his family members, Rudy Giuliani. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=83.3s)]
*  There's a simple answer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=84.77999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=87.1s)]
*  No, Mr. President. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=88.1s)]
*  That would be a gross abuse of the presidential pardon authority. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  That all comes as we continue to get new reports, even tonight, that President Trump, as he [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=93.66s)]
*  winds down his last few weeks in office, is considering preemptive pardons for all his [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=98.22s)]
*  adult children, including his son-in-law Jared. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=104.13999999999999s)]
*  What a mess. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=107.74s)]
*  Does this concern you? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=111.63999999999999s)]
*  All these preemptive pardons? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=113.46s)]
*  Well, it concerns me in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and how the rest of the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=115.56s)]
*  world looks at us as a nation of laws and injustice. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=123.08s)]
*  You're not going to see in our administration that kind of approach to pardons. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=128.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=137.4s)]
*  Oh, isn't that nice? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=138.4s)]
*  The funniest part of that, though, had to be Adam Schiff, right, your old friend? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=142.16s)]
*  Because he got one of the pardons that he said nobody should have. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=145.16s)]
*  Anyway, leading that effort would be our next guest to investigate all this, the chairman [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=149.16s)]
*  of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=153.96s)]
*  These guys have done phenomenal work. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=158.76s)]
*  James Comer is a bestselling book out about the Bidens. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=160.68s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=164.96s)]
*  How much money did the Biden family make? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=165.96s)]
*  The family took in $27 million from our adversaries around the world. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=168.82s)]
*  They never could say, even when we brought them in for depositions and interviews, what [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=172.1s)]
*  they actually did to receive the money. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=175.66s)]
*  Then we found, going through their bank records, that they had another $8 million in loans [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  that they never paid back, never paid any interest on or anything. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=182.66s)]
*  So that's $35 million. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=185.74s)]
*  I want that loan. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=186.74s)]
*  Can I have that loan? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=187.74s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=188.74s)]
*  Wouldn't we all? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=189.74s)]
*  I think everybody here would like it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=190.74s)]
*  And you expose all of this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=191.74s)]
*  Now, I would argue that he forgot one person, himself. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=195.14s)]
*  Well, you know, what we said in our investigation was that we found 10 different Biden family [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=199.14s)]
*  members, including Joe Biden, profited from the influence-peddling schemes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=205.38s)]
*  The money would come from a wire from a foreign adversary, usually a foreign oligarch. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=209.33999999999997s)]
*  In some cases, we believe the country of China... [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  Whoa, an oligarch. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=216.61999999999998s)]
*  Didn't Joe Biden warn us about oligarchs? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=217.61999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=219.5s)]
*  Aren't there oligarchs? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=220.5s)]
*  Elena Batorreina, wasn't she an oligarch? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=221.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=222.5s)]
*  The people in Kazakhstan, the people in Ukraine, the people in China? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=223.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=226.86s)]
*  Romania. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=227.86s)]
*  A lot of oligarchs that Biden's... [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=228.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=229.86s)]
*  The money would then go through a series of shell companies. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=230.86s)]
*  Then it would be laundered down. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=233.94s)]
*  And then the 10 different Biden family members would receive incremental payments. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=235.74s)]
*  And ironically, six of the pardons came from family that received payments that had been [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=240.66s)]
*  laundered. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=247.9s)]
*  This isn't my word, John. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=248.9s)]
*  These are the words of six different banks. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=249.9s)]
*  They were laundering money through shell companies that the Biden families received. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=251.24s)]
*  He pardoned them preemptively. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=256.24s)]
*  And the only place in the world the spouses were ever named was in our investigation in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=258.76s)]
*  the Oversight and Judiciary Committee. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=263.04s)]
*  We named those spouses by name. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  The media, other than your show, Sean, and thank you for being the platform to get this [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=266.08s)]
*  out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=270.24s)]
*  Thank God your ratings are higher than MSNBC and CNN combined. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=271.24s)]
*  Thank God, too. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=274.12s)]
*  The American people... [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=275.12s)]
*  I second that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=276.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=277.12s)]
*  The American people saw it in that meeting. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=278.12s)]
*  You guys did the digging, the hard work, and you exposed the Peter Schweitzer deserves [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  a lot of credit to. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=283.64s)]
*  He wrote the book Secret Empires. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=284.64s)]
*  President Trump signed this weaponization of government has to stop. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=286.76s)]
*  Also revoking 51 former intel officials that knew nothing about Hunter's laptop and tried [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=292.56s)]
*  to interfere in an election. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=298.58s)]
*  Jim Jordan, you were there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=300.32s)]
*  You investigated every part of this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=302.24s)]
*  Didn't Hunter's laptop talk about half his income going to Pops? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=304.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=307.72s)]
*  The WhatsApp message to the head of the CEFC. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  Didn't Joe's home repairs get paid for by Hunter Biden according to emails with their [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=314.44000000000005s)]
*  economic guru, Eric Sherwin, if I'm not mistaken? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=320.88000000000005s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  All that took place. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  But what I really think was important today is President Trump did what he said he would [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  do when it came to pardons and people, the defendants of January 6, and Joe Biden did [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=330.88000000000005s)]
*  it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  He told us he would never pardon his family and yet he did all of them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=336.96s)]
*  Joe Biden said, oh, there's no pardons needed. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  We just heard it for folks who were involved with the January 6 committee and yet he did [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  So Joe Biden did exactly opposite what he told us he was going to do. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  President Trump kept his word, did exactly what he said. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  I think that's the big takeaway from the actions we see from both the outgoing president and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  of course, okay, here's the big question. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=358.84s)]
*  Is this over? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=361.06s)]
*  Because my understanding, Alan Dershowitz's understanding, is once you get a pardon, you [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=363.66s)]
*  no longer have the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=367.94s)]
*  If they go before your committees, every one of these pardon family members, don't they [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  have to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help them God? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=377.34000000000003s)]
*  There's a number of things we want to look at. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  Everything's on the table. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=382.54s)]
*  But I really think one of the keys is the report we got just right before, just a few [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=383.54s)]
*  weeks ago was with the 26 confidential human sources, 26 confidential human sources here [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=388.3s)]
*  on January 6, 2021, 17 inside restricted space, four in the Capitol, two of those four in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=394.74s)]
*  the Capitol were tasked to be here by the FBI. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  I think there are all kinds of questions. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=403.74s)]
*  I have five people that said Trump authorized the use of the guard days before. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=404.98s)]
*  So did the Capitol police chief, by the way, begging for the National Guard in writing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=410.7s)]
*  Muriel Bowser denied the use of the National Guard. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=415.0s)]
*  It was her authorization. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=418.36s)]
*  Pelosi did nothing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=420.08s)]
*  They never brought in the sergeant of arms. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=421.08s)]
*  Liz Cheney needed hers in my view too. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=423.36s)]
*  Not to mention the number of false things that committee put out on me, on you, on so [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=425.56s)]
*  many people. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=430.68s)]
*  Me? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=431.68s)]
*  Little old me. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=432.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=433.68s)]
*  So yeah, I think there's some unanswered questions we have to get to there. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=434.68s)]
*  So we will look at that and you'll do that too. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=436.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=438.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=439.92s)]
*  You guys are going rock stars. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=440.92s)]
*  Thank you for what you're doing. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=441.92s)]
*  I would let the American people know the truth, pardoned or not. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=443.28s)]
*  And let's see if they tell the truth when they have to, on the road. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9MitscoQ-E&t=450.64s)]
