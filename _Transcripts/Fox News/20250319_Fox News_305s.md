# John Kennedy: The 'loon wing' of the Democratic Party is firmly in control
**Fox News:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo)
*  Here with reaction one of our favorite senators Louisiana Senator John Kennedy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=0.0s)]
*  senator I don't know I'm looking at this and I'm thinking that Chuck stays may be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=4.88s)]
*  numbered just like Jimmy Kimmel. Sean I don't hate anybody that includes [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Senator Schumer he's very smart on the other hand Chuck's often wrong he never [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  makes the same mistake twice he he makes it five or six times just to be sure but [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=27.0s)]
*  this time he got it right in supporting our efforts to keep government open [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=35.92s)]
*  unless unless the football coach taught you history you understand that shutting [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=42.08s)]
*  government down never achieves anything it just scares people especially the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  elderly having said that many Democrats are angry at Schumer among them right now [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=53.88s)]
*  we've all seen the news he's about as popular as chlamydia but that to me that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=62.92s)]
*  to me says as much about the Democratic Party as it does about Senator Schumer [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  what it tells me is that the Loon Wing of the Democratic Party is firmly in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=76.2s)]
*  control now that's great for the Republican Party but it's bad for America these people are deeply [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=83.2s)]
*  weird for example no honest person whose IQ is above his age doesn't believe that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=93.52s)]
*  biological sex doesn't exist but they do that's what I mean when I say they're deeply weird [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=103.4s)]
*  our Republican secret plan for dealing with the Democrats is called operation let them speak [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=110.96s)]
*  but that's and that's good for our party but it's bad for America and I think Schumer did the right thing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=118.36s)]
*  you know I've never been as afraid of government shutdowns because it always ends the same way [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=125.32s)]
*  they end up opening the government and people that do get furloughed end up getting you know [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=131.84s)]
*  paid vacation in the end paid leave and we never take away essential services the military keeps [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=138.04s)]
*  defending our country social security checks keep going out other essential services you know [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=144.76s)]
*  continue so it never quite work it becomes the doom and gloom that people predicted to be but [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=150.12s)]
*  with that said I don't think the Democrats had much leverage here wasn't that we're still living [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=156.56s)]
*  under the Biden-Harris budget are we not this is still their economy is it not well yes but we [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=161.88s)]
*  we we fixed it as best we could for example in this particular budget we added six billion dollars [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=170.64s)]
*  for the fence spending we cut 13 billion dollars from non-defense discretionary spending it's a [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=179.12s)]
*  lesser amount of spending than last year or the year before but it but but it wasn't our budget [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=186.0s)]
*  it was the Democrats budget and Schumer kept it off the Senate floor that's the reason we were in [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=192.12s)]
*  this this position Schumer kept it off the Senate floor so we had to do a CR I hope I don't mean to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=198.0s)]
*  sound so so geeky here but but that's what happened this was all Senator Schumer's fault but as I said [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=204.64s)]
*  this to me says more about the Democratic Party today than it does about Senator Schumer let me [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=212.52s)]
*  ask you Senator do you think do you think he is do you think he might be deposed do you think that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=217.8s)]
*  that he might be challenged do you think that somebody might challenge his leadership no no [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=224.52s)]
*  that's what's up I you've heard me say this before if it wasn't for double standards in Washington [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=233.52s)]
*  there wouldn't be any standards at all most Democrats in the Senate most Democrats in the Senate [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=240.04s)]
*  supported what Schumer did and they're they're scared of him whatever Schumer says generally [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=246.32s)]
*  speaking they just moo and follow him into the chute like cattle and I don't think that'll change [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=253.32s)]
*  I double-dog dare one of them to take him on and see what what happens he'll cut him off like a dead [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=260.24s)]
*  stump the one thing I'll say is Democrats usually circle the wagons and Republicans create circular [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=266.88s)]
*  firing squads this is the one time I think roles have reversed hopefully permanently so I think [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=274.48s)]
*  Donald Trump had a big part to play in that Senator Kennedy we could talk to you all night I don't [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=279.88s)]
*  think there's any more entertaining senator in Washington than you and as smart on top of that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKCijzHXQzo&t=285.0s)]
