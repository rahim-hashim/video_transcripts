# Biden has failed worldwide in deterring our adversaries: John Ratcliffe
**Fox News:** [December 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k)
*  Here now with reaction, the former director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe. Director, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=0.0s)]
*  thanks for joining us. I had the pleasure of serving with you in the United States Congress, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=5.68s)]
*  but thrilled to be chatting with you about this because as the director of national intelligence, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=10.24s)]
*  you saw the top level intelligence of this country. What's your read on what's going on [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=16.0s)]
*  in the Middle East now? Because boy, we take a hundred attacks and do the bare minimum to say [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=22.88s)]
*  the least. Yeah, Jason, by the Biden administration's own admission, they have failed to accomplish the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=28.16s)]
*  strategic deterrence that they promised. You remember when these attacks that you just mentioned [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=38.24s)]
*  started in the aftermath of the October 7th attack in Gaza, the Biden administration stood at the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=43.68s)]
*  podium, John Kirby, Secretary of Defense Austin, they said, we will respond in a manner and method [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=52.24s)]
*  of our choosing. But we promise you that we will deter these types of attacks from happening in the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=57.2s)]
*  future. Well, at that time they were at 20. Now, as you said, Jason, were well over a hundred attacks [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=62.24s)]
*  and Jason, the text you mentioned yesterday were from Kataib Hezbollah. But the week before they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=67.84s)]
*  were from the Houthi rebels. And of course, Hamas didn't just kill 1400 Jews. They killed 32 Americans [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=73.6s)]
*  at least on October 7th and took about a dozen American hostages. So, you know, the Biden [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=81.12s)]
*  administration's running out of terror cells to get pushed around by in the Middle East. And of course, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=87.36s)]
*  all of those groups that I just mentioned, Jason, they're all controlled by, funded by Iran. And [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  what's so frustrating when you talk about, you know, the intelligence that I've seen is, you know, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=97.68s)]
*  at the end of our administration, we handed the Biden administration peace in the Middle East. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  We handed them the Abraham Accords and we handed them in Iran that was bankrupt, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=107.76s)]
*  that was incapable of funding these type of terror activities. You know, they were focused [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  on regime survival alone and they didn't have money for the Houthis, Hamas and Hezbollah, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  names that have now become household names for all the wrong reasons in the Biden administration [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=125.2s)]
*  because they have failed to accomplish strategic deterrence against our adversaries. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, the polling has certainly gone sour for Joe Biden. I don't see anybody really in the United [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=134.72s)]
*  States as thrilled with how he's handling this. And how do you, what's your read of that? Why is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=141.92s)]
*  that? Because it doesn't seem that anybody's happy with how the response is going. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=147.44s)]
*  Well, I think like a lot of his foreign policy decisions, they've been schizophrenic. I mean, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=152.8s)]
*  in this case, he's expressed support for Israel verbally, but then he's paraded one official after [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=157.44s)]
*  another to meet with Netanyahu and other Israeli officials to pressure them to end the campaign [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=163.76s)]
*  against Hamas in a matter of weeks, something that our own intelligence tells us is impossible. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  This has got to continue to destroy Hamas. It's a campaign that's going to have to last for months, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=175.76s)]
*  and yet he's asking the Israelis to do the impossible. So as a result, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=180.64s)]
*  he's engaged in a policy that's making no one happy. Some people think he's supporting Israel [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=184.64s)]
*  too much. Some people think he's supporting Hamas too much, and only a few people think he's getting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=188.64s)]
*  it just right. And I think this is unfortunately something that we've seen throughout the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=193.04s)]
*  administration. It's not just here in the Middle East. Jason, I would challenge you to find a place [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  on the globe where U.S. national security interests have improved in the Biden administration and where [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=203.76s)]
*  the national security interests of our enemies and adversaries have waned. It's certainly not [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=210.56s)]
*  the Middle East. It's not Asia where China has pushed us around. It's not Europe where Putin has [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=215.28s)]
*  now invaded Ukraine twice while Biden's been in the White House. It's not in Central and South [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=220.0s)]
*  America where we're currently seeing what is commonly being referred to as the Biden invasion [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=224.4s)]
*  of our southern border. So everywhere America sees, they see failure from the Biden administration [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=229.52s)]
*  from a foreign policy standpoint. And I get that, you know, Bidenomics and the domestic policy has [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=235.44s)]
*  been a disaster, but I would submit to you as the former director of national intelligence that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=240.88s)]
*  their foreign policy has been an even greater failure. Well, let's talk about that because now [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=245.68s)]
*  we have Secretary Mayorkas, Secretary Blinken, headed down to Mexico to talk with the Mexican [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  government. I don't know what their message is. The only policy I see out of Joe Biden and Kamala [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=257.92s)]
*  Harris is one of open borders and an invitation to come to this country because nothing's going to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=263.6s)]
*  happen to you if you come illegally. We'll give you a free plane ride, they'll give you a phone, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=268.56s)]
*  and then we'll give you housing and everything else. That's what I see them doing. I don't know [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  what in the world they're going to ask from the Mexican government. Well, and you know, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=278.0s)]
*  Lopez Obrador, the president of Mexico, you know, he sees what's happening around the world and the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=283.52s)]
*  idea that he's going to do what the Biden administration asks without the threat of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=288.64s)]
*  imposing some cost on Mexico that they can't sustain. It's just not going to happen. Look, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  at the end of our administration, we had a secure border and we had Mexico enforcing their border [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=299.52s)]
*  because we had the remain in Mexico policy. Jason, in our transition, we told the Biden [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  administration, if you reverse this policy, you're going to create a crisis at the border. You're [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=311.2s)]
*  going to have these caravans coming up. And that's exactly what's happened. So they created this [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=315.12s)]
*  crisis at the border, and it's not going to go away unless they're willing to impose costs on Mexico [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=320.4s)]
*  like we did in the Trump administration. But they haven't been willing to impose sanctions or costs [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=326.8s)]
*  on any countries to get them to do the things that the United States need to do for our own [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=332.0s)]
*  national security interests. That's right. Whether it be the Middle East, in China, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=337.28s)]
*  down in Mexico, we speak a language that nobody is understanding because we don't stand up for [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=344.24s)]
*  ourselves. We don't stand up for the United States of America. We act like a second class citizen [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=349.44s)]
*  that's just going to let everybody else roll right over us. And I'm tired of it, and I think [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=354.32s)]
*  the American people are tired of it. And listen, I appreciate your perspective and the great role [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4afAdnF49k&t=360.0s)]
