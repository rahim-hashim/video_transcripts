# Mike Waltz shares what needs to happen to end Russia-Ukraine war
**Fox News:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=0.0s)]
*  During a press conference in Moscow, Vladimir Putin said he needs more clarifications before [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=2.36s)]
*  Russia will agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine, while also adding that he is willing to negotiate [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=6.7s)]
*  with President Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=12.3s)]
*  That is called progress. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=13.58s)]
*  Earlier today, addressing reporters in the Oval Office, President Trump called Putin's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=14.58s)]
*  response called promising but incomplete. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=19.02s)]
*  Meanwhile, according to an NBC News report, the White House has asked the military to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=21.38s)]
*  develop options for the Panama Canal, which allegedly range from partnering more closely [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=26.34s)]
*  with Panama's security forces to a less likely option of U.S. troops taking back control [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  of the canal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=38.28s)]
*  Joining us now at the very latest on all of this, National Security Advisor Mike Walz, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=39.28s)]
*  first, let me tip my hat to you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=43.44s)]
*  You, Secretary of State Rubio, Steve Witkoff, I know all of you are working very hard. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=45.58s)]
*  Tell us what happened when you were in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=55.14s)]
*  Well, first, Sean, the secretary general of NATO was with President Trump today in the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=59.14s)]
*  Oval Office, and he said it perfectly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=64.9s)]
*  He looked at the president and said, only you, President Trump, could have broken this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=66.62s)]
*  logjam, this quagmire that President Biden got us into, World War I-style trench warfare [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=70.86s)]
*  meat grinder of men, material, national treasure that is completely unsustainable. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=81.62s)]
*  So in Saudi Arabia, with our great secretary of state Marco Rubio, we had a very different [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=88.7s)]
*  approach from the Ukrainians than you saw just a week ago with President Zelensky in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=94.92s)]
*  the Oval Office. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=100.06s)]
*  They were very forthcoming. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=101.9s)]
*  We had very good conversations. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=104.9s)]
*  At one point, we even broke out a map and started drawing on it on how we're going to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=108.14s)]
*  end this war. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=113.82s)]
*  And you saw as a result of the end that the Ukrainians agreed that they need to move to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=114.82s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=120.42s)]
*  All sides need to move to a ceasefire. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=121.58s)]
*  We have to stop the killing, as President Trump has said over and over again, and talk [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=123.9s)]
*  about a permanent end to this peace within European-led security in terms of a permanent [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=128.89999999999998s)]
*  peace. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=137.33999999999997s)]
*  So all of those things are underway. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=138.33999999999997s)]
*  And again, as President Zelensky said in an initial phone call, as President Putin said [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=141.98s)]
*  on the initial phone call, and as the NATO secretary general has said, only President [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=147.66s)]
*  Trump could have brought us from this far away. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=152.66s)]
*  I mean, literally, no sides talking closer and closer together to end this war. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=157.1s)]
*  All right, let me ask you this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=162.1s)]
*  Russia says they're ready to discuss peace with Ukraine. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=164.62s)]
*  Putin says he's open to a Ukraine peace deal. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=167.66s)]
*  Putin did put out also a lot of caveats. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=171.38s)]
*  My understanding is, I believe it's Steve Witkoff. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=174.82s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=177.78s)]
*  I'm not 100 percent sure, but I believe it's Steve Witkoff and that there are meetings [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=178.78s)]
*  taking place in Moscow that took place today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=183.62s)]
*  I'm assuming you don't want to negotiate on national television and tell us everything [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=186.94s)]
*  that happened. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=190.82s)]
*  I respect that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=191.82s)]
*  But do you have a level of confidence? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=193.26s)]
*  I understand when Putin has his caveats, he's negotiating on his end. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=197.54s)]
*  There are things he's going to want. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=203.5s)]
*  There are things Zelensky's going to want. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=204.72s)]
*  And neither Zelensky or Putin are going to get everything that they want, if we're [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=206.94s)]
*  going to get a deal. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=210.34s)]
*  With all that said, are you confident we can get there? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=212.3s)]
*  Well, Sean, we'll see. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=219.3s)]
*  But I'm confident if anybody could get us there, it's President Trump. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=220.9s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=225.14s)]
*  I'm not going to announce or negotiate anything on national television, certainly not ahead [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=226.14s)]
*  of the president. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=231.42s)]
*  But we do have some cautious optimism. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=233.12s)]
*  You saw the Ukrainians move from where we were in the Oval Office to where we were in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=235.86s)]
*  Saudi Arabia with Secretary of State Rubio. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=241.5s)]
*  And you saw President Putin's press conference today. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=245.18s)]
*  Of course, both sides are going to have their demands, and of course both sides are going [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=248.78s)]
*  to have to make some compromises. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=253.16s)]
*  And the shuttle diplomacy of going back and forth is happening. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=255.96s)]
*  I've spoken to my counterpart. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=259.66s)]
*  Special Envoy Witkoff is out there and bringing things back for us to evaluate and for the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=262.06s)]
*  President Trump to make decisions on next steps. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=268.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think, look, it's obviously very important for everybody. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=271.98s)]
*  If I were to imagine how this deal unfolds, it's going to be the rare earth mineral deal, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=277.74s)]
*  a component that keeps U.S. involvement and a presence in Ukraine. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=282.46s)]
*  Maybe European troops can be in Ukraine as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=288.42s)]
*  I would imagine that Ukraine being a part of NATO is not going to happen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=291.9s)]
*  I would imagine parts, maybe the Donbas region in particular, or areas that are heavily populated [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=296.54s)]
*  by people from Russia, that would go to Putin in any negotiated settlement. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=302.98s)]
*  Am I wrong in my conjecture here? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=308.14s)]
*  Sean, no surprise you're not wrong in any of that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=311.58s)]
*  And what's important is that we are discussing all of those things with both sides. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=316.7s)]
*  We are having those discussions with our counterparts, with the Russians. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=322.58s)]
*  We are having those discussions with our counterparts, with the Ukrainians. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=325.98s)]
*  And we are pushing both sides together with President Trump, the dealmaker in chief, that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=330.38s)]
*  is determined to end this war. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=336.70000000000005s)]
*  And for everyone that is just hand-wringing Democrats that were demanding ceasefires and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  diplomacy in Gaza, marching in the streets still, but yet have some kind of inherent [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=344.54s)]
*  opposition to President Trump driving this war to an end and stopping the killing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=350.78s)]
*  He's determined to do it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=356.85999999999996s)]
*  He's got a great team around him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=357.97999999999996s)]
*  And we're going to get this done. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  What happened to the party that once was singing, all we're saying is give peace a chance. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=363.14s)]
*  They seem to have disappeared. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  They're the party now forever wars. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=369.46s)]
*  Congratulations to the president, to you, to Secretary of State Rubio, to Steve Woodcoff [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=371.73999999999995s)]
*  and Godspeed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=376.73999999999995s)]
*  It's a heavy lift. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUuNz0D5o0&t=377.73999999999995s)]
