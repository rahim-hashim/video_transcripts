# Trump appears to be king of the MAGA world: Sandra Smith
**Fox News:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0)
*  She is the co-anchor of America Reports. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=0.0s)]
*  Sandra Smith is with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=3.74s)]
*  Sandra, what are we learning from the voters tonight? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=4.74s)]
*  Hey, Sean, really interesting stuff is coming in, and especially when it comes to that MAGA [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=6.98s)]
*  voter. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=12.66s)]
*  It's telling us a lot about how President Trump is having a really good night there [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=13.66s)]
*  in Iowa. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=18.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=19.54s)]
*  This is some of the key findings so far when it comes to the MAGA supporters in our Fox [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=20.54s)]
*  News analysis. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=25.0s)]
*  Over than six in ten of them, of those caucus goers that identify as MAGA, the vast majority [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=26.8s)]
*  of them, close to eight in ten, it is revealed, are breaking for Donald Trump. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=32.28s)]
*  He still appears to be king of the MAGA world, 77 percent of them. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=37.96s)]
*  But looking at the moderate voters, this is a key group that we were watching heading [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=42.02s)]
*  into Iowa. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=45.92s)]
*  This appears to give some hope to Nikki Haley. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Now when it comes to those moderate voters, she doesn't beat Donald Trump there, but she's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=50.72s)]
*  well ahead of DeSantis and Ramoswami among moderate voters. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=54.78s)]
*  This may reflect something about her potential strength in a general election. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=60.22s)]
*  So that is a key takeaway. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  Now let's take a look at another very key group there in Iowa, and that is the evangelical [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=66.1s)]
*  Christian voter. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=70.94s)]
*  This is a sizable group in Iowa. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=72.34s)]
*  We all know that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  We've been watching that heading into Iowa. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  With this group, DeSantis courted them, was even endorsed by Bob Vander Plaats, as we [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=77.5s)]
*  know, but they love Donald Trump. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=83.02s)]
*  DeSantis is 40 points behind him and just five points ahead of Haley. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=85.97999999999999s)]
*  All right, so another key finding with Trump is the fact that he is still facing multiple [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=90.97999999999999s)]
*  investigations and indictments. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=96.74s)]
*  So we put the question to voters. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=99.38s)]
*  This for the most part does not appear to be a factor for caucus goers. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Look at this, more than half think the former president did nothing wrong on January 6th. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=105.69999999999999s)]
*  Half think the same about interference in the 2020 election. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=111.98s)]
*  That bumps down to four in 10, as you can see, when it comes to classified documents [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=116.22s)]
*  at his Florida home. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=120.86s)]
*  Overall, though, I Republicans think the investigation into the former president are political, not [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=122.42s)]
*  legitimate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=129.5s)]
*  So take a look at this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=130.82s)]
*  Another key finding and a question that we put to voters when it comes to those Trump [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=132.62s)]
*  charges close to eight and 10, say the charges against Trump are political. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=136.06s)]
*  Only two and say a two and 10 say legitimate. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=140.84s)]
*  And speaking of legitimate, more than six in 10 caucus goers say President Biden was [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=144.78s)]
*  not legitimately elected four years ago. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=150.88s)]
*  This is when we put this question to voters. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=153.88s)]
*  Those who think Biden's election was on the up and up clicking yes here, they're backing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=156.4s)]
*  Nikki Haley. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=162.28s)]
*  Those who don't break strongly close to three quarters for Donald Trump. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=163.38s)]
*  And finally, one other hot button issue among Iowa Republicans is what is being taught in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=168.76s)]
*  schools. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=174.68s)]
*  So we asked about three issues. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=175.68s)]
*  And here is what they said and some of the top findings that we took away from the Fox [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=177.68s)]
*  News voter analysis. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=182.32s)]
*  School teachings have say K through eight schools are teaching too much, Sean, about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=184.44s)]
*  racism. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=189.92s)]
*  But look, close to three quarters of caucus attendees think schools are focusing too much [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=191.02s)]
*  on sexual orientation and gender identity. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=195.82s)]
*  These are some really revealing numbers. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=199.78s)]
*  Something to dig into, Sean, and brand new information just for you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=203.06s)]
*  All right, Sandra, great job. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  Fascinating the way people think what what goes into their voting day of voting. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=208.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZeYYo0ivP0&t=213.06s)]
