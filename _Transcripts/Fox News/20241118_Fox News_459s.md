# Trump is fighting for a mandate to be normal again, Ari Fleischer says
**Fox News:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM)
*  Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=0.0s)]
*  is with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=5.04s)]
*  Ari, I love your idea. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=6.04s)]
*  This is a mandate to get our economy on track, interest rates lower, the cost of things lower, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=9.32s)]
*  fix our borders immediately, which is the biggest national security risk, fix America's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=15.58s)]
*  schools, make sure our towns are safe and secure, make us energy dominant so we can [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=21.32s)]
*  country, get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, and fix departments and fix agencies that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=26.72s)]
*  have either been weaponized or politicized and bring them to their former greatness. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  That to me is the mandate, and that goes to the core of D.C.'s problem, its bureaucracy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=42.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a mandate also to let us just live our lives normally, to live our lives [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=48.04s)]
*  with common sense, to live our lives in a way that allows us to be prosperous and to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=54.36s)]
*  have cheap gasoline and to have all the options that the American people used to have without [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=58.28s)]
*  crime and without all the burdens that we've had over the last four years, including inflation [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=63.04s)]
*  and everything going on with the southern border and drugs. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=67.64s)]
*  It's just a mandate to be normal again, Sean. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=70.84s)]
*  That's really what Donald Trump's fighting for. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  It's also geared at what I call the enlisted men and women of our society. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=76.44s)]
*  It's not geared to the rich or the powerful. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=81.24s)]
*  Those who have the greatest access to lobbyists to maneuver through those giant bureaucracies. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  It's about the brick agents at the FBI, the cops on the street, the blue collar worker. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  This is a new change for Republicans. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  Trump's ushered it in. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  I hope he's going to be successful. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=97.52s)]
*  He's got a lot of challenges ahead to get this done well and done right, but that's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  the direction he wants to go. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  To what degree does he have to worry about Rhino Republicans that maybe want to get in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  the way? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=111.84s)]
*  Maybe they like the bureaucracy also. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=112.84s)]
*  In many ways, I think you can argue at times we have a one party system where they tend [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  to agree with each other and they like the system as it is and they don't want to change [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=119.7s)]
*  it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=123.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, they could be, Sean, but look, this victory was so overwhelming, so stunning, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=124.76s)]
*  so much a shock to the entire system. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=134.0s)]
*  I think part of, I mean, the Democrat party is completely stunned. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=137.88s)]
*  I think there's a part of the Republican party that's completely stunned too. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=141.72s)]
*  And if you look at it, the Democrats only improved in three areas. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=145.24s)]
*  Number one, non-religious people, people who make over $100,000 a year and people who have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  graduate degrees. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=156.12s)]
*  I mean, they lost across the board and people like Joe and Mika. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=157.12s)]
*  I mean, their problem is, there's a couple things. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=161.84s)]
*  One, ratings. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  In 2016, they were all over Donald Trump. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  He could call into any show he wanted. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=169.56s)]
*  They were making money. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  But then they figured out that there was money to be made on the anti-Trump side. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=173.2s)]
*  And so then they went there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=176.88s)]
*  And a lot of media, they're making money on the anti-Trump side. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=178.68s)]
*  There's grifters over there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  They're making money on being against Trump. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=183.92s)]
*  And now they were shocked to find out exactly what Ari just laid out, that, oh my gosh, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm outside the circle of what's normal and acceptable. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=190.32s)]
*  And so going back to your question, the reason why Donald Trump is going to have such a huge [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  mandate here is that the country, by Donald Trump winning the popular vote, said, wait [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=199.56s)]
*  a second, this stuff over here that the Democrats are pushing, it's not normal, it's not [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=204.56s)]
*  acceptable and we reject it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=209.6s)]
*  Whether you're in New Jersey, Minnesota, Wisconsin or downtown Los Angeles, Donald [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump did better. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=218.12s)]
*  And that is what the shock to the system is. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  But you have congressional Democrats, Ari. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  You have Governor Pritzker. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  You have Governor Healey. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=228.27999999999997s)]
*  You have all the—Governor Newsom. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, they're all preparing, quote, the resistance against Donald Trump. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=231.76s)]
*  I'm not sure what that means. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=236.76s)]
*  And they're actually fighting to keep the Harris-Biden-unvetted illegal immigrants in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=238.76s)]
*  the country. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=244.56s)]
*  Now, my question is— [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=245.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=246.56s)]
*  In what part—what do they say to the families that had loved ones murdered, the families [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=248.2s)]
*  that had loved ones raped, the families that—whose members are victims of violent crime? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=252.56s)]
*  What do they say about known terrorists being in the country? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=259.08s)]
*  Why would they resist, you know, getting that element out of this country? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=262.48s)]
*  What part of them wanting to aid in a bet and lawbreaking is OK when they say that Republicans [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=268.08s)]
*  are a threat to democracy or Donald Trump's a threat to democracy and Joe and Kamala aided [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=273.8s)]
*  and abetted all of that lawbreaking? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=279.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they have anything to say to those people because their priorities [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=282.12s)]
*  lie elsewhere. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=287.52s)]
*  Their priorities lie with not making a moral distinction between legal immigration, which [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=288.52s)]
*  we want, and illegal immigration, which we must not put up with. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=292.68s)]
*  But you know, Sean, I'm kind of tempted to go along with these Democrats. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=297.64s)]
*  I like what they're doing because the result will be that the taxpaying public, people [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=301.0s)]
*  who are successful, will leave those states as they already have and move to red states, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=305.52s)]
*  and then people who are here illegally are all going to swarm those states. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  And so they're going to go into a spiral of their own making because of the policies they [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=314.06s)]
*  espouse. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=318.52s)]
*  The only thing that might stop them is if Republicans continue to do so well with a [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=319.52s)]
*  Hispanic vote, they may actually be the first ones to want the wall built because now they [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=323.79999999999995s)]
*  realize these aren't future voters. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=328.32s)]
*  Well, you—for example, we've been following the recount in Pennsylvania. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=330.72s)]
*  And in spite of a Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruling in September, they still want to violate [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=336.16s)]
*  the law and violate a Supreme Court decision. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=343.48s)]
*  Now, the Supreme Court had to weigh in again. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=346.48s)]
*  No, we really meant what we said in September, and you're not allowed to count votes if [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=349.2s)]
*  it doesn't meet the legal requirements of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  At least that got stopped, but the fact that they wanted to violate it is mind-blowing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=358.24s)]
*  to me. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, no question about that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  The Democrats, trying to support Bob Casey, and I should disclose I worked on the McCormick [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=368.24s)]
*  campaign, they wanted to count illegal votes, and they got their hand slapped by the Pennsylvania [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=372.92s)]
*  Supreme Court today. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=378.76s)]
*  It's amazing Governor Shapiro never spoke out until after the ruling was made by the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=379.76s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  It's lawlessness, and no one should put up with it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, last word. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  We'll give it to you, Reince. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  How will this end? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  Will Donald Trump be able to deliver on these reforms? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=393.16s)]
*  A hundred percent, because we're living in the world of the 75 percent. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=396.16s)]
*  We live in a world where we say we're going to secure the border and protect the American [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=403.16s)]
*  worker. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  We're going to confront China, who's ripping off the world, that we're going to end or [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  stop endless wars and bring our troops home. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  And lastly, we don't want boys competing against girls in sports. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=412.72s)]
*  This is where the Democrats lost. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  They stopped living in the world of the 75 percent, and that's where we're at. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's a freight train that they're going to have a really hard time stopping. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=423.6s)]
*  And I think it's time for waste, fraud, abuse, overspending, endless bureaucracy to finally [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXpvDnljHzM&t=427.48s)]
