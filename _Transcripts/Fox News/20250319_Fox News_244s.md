# Inside mega-prison housing gang members deported by Trump
**Fox News:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY)
*  Here with more on the mega prisons now housing some more than 100 criminals deported from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=0.0s)]
*  our country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=5.32s)]
*  Fox News contributor Sarah Carter is with us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=6.32s)]
*  Sarah, you know these prisons well. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=8.68s)]
*  Tell us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I had the opportunity to visit the prison, Sikot Maximum Security Prison in El Salvador [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  last year, Sean. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=18.76s)]
*  And it was incredible, the cooperation with President Bukele. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=20.32s)]
*  He allowed me full access to the prison. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=25.52s)]
*  I was given access to every corridor of that prison, as well as the director who spoke [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=28.08s)]
*  to me about how they were housing them, where these prisoners were coming from. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=33.2s)]
*  And under the terrorism laws in El Salvador, Bukele was able to clean up his nation and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=37.36s)]
*  remove these nefarious, horrible people off the streets that were holding his citizens [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=43.32s)]
*  prisoner. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=49.08s)]
*  And I think the cooperation that you're seeing between President Bukele and President Trump [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=50.16s)]
*  is so significant. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=54.76s)]
*  We cannot solve this problem in the Western Hemisphere without this type of cooperation, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=56.12s)]
*  which is the reason why you saw President Trump extend such a grateful thank you to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=61.92s)]
*  President Bukele over the weekend when they used the act to deport these terrorists out [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=66.4s)]
*  of our country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=74.48s)]
*  And Bukele was willing to hold them in this secure facility. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=76.0s)]
*  This facility is like nothing I've ever seen in my life. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=80.08s)]
*  I've had the opportunity to visit other areas in the world, other prisons in the world. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=84.04s)]
*  This is highly organized. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=88.76s)]
*  These people are detained. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=90.2s)]
*  They are all Tren de Aragüe. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=91.72s)]
*  In fact, Sean, I spoke to several high-level sources this evening who said that everybody [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  that was on that plane was either a Tren de Aragüe member from Venezuela or MS-13. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  All of these people are the most notorious gang members that you can imagine, that were [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  allowed in our nation under President Biden when he opened the borders and allowed people [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=111.74s)]
*  to come in here without any background checks. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=117.58s)]
*  This is about protecting the American people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  It is about protecting our national security. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  And it is about protecting the Western Hemisphere. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=125.5s)]
*  And by the way, for those people that are crying about whether or not these people are [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=128.1s)]
*  given their due process, yes, they came in here illegally. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=132.9s)]
*  They are being sent back. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=136.54s)]
*  But what about the due process of the victims? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=138.3s)]
*  What about Jocelyn Nungare? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=141.08s)]
*  What about Lake and Riley? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=143.10000000000002s)]
*  What about all the other people that have been murdered and slaughtered by these people [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=144.46s)]
*  that have no loyalty to any nation, no loyalty to any person, and would do and have done [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=149.06s)]
*  the most heinous crimes, even to children? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=156.28s)]
*  We know there are people within that group that are child predators. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  These are robbers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=162.34s)]
*  These are murderers. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=163.34s)]
*  These are the worst of the worst. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=164.5s)]
*  So I can tell you this, that El Salvador, I've spoken to officials in El Salvador this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=166.38s)]
*  weekend, they are willing and ready to work with the United States government again. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=171.62s)]
*  They are ready to work with President Trump. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  And I can tell you this, that in the United States right now, we have an administration [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=178.62s)]
*  that is sending a message across the globe, do not come to the United States. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=183.26s)]
*  You will be deported. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=190.0s)]
*  You will be put in a maximum security facility. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=191.62s)]
*  And we are now working with our partners in the Western Hemisphere to ensure that that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=195.26s)]
*  is done. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=199.66s)]
*  And the greatest partner right now is President Nayib Bukele, and he is willing to take them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=200.66s)]
*  And I think that's very significant. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=205.74s)]
*  And the president, President Trump, did thank the president for his help and cooperation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=208.46s)]
*  And I think this is only the beginning. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=212.82s)]
*  And as the Alien Enemies Act points out, it is well within his authority as the commander-in-chief [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=215.54s)]
*  to do so. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=222.46s)]
*  And any dispute, I think, will be summarily kicked out of court, probably by the Supreme [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  Court ultimately, if need be. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=228.82s)]
*  Sara Carter, thank you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0a0Sbn7YUY&t=230.58s)]
