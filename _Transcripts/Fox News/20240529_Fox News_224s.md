# Trump spokeswoman: Democrats are in a ‘full-blown freakout’
**Fox News:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA)
*  Here now with reaction from the Trump campaign is Trump 2024, National Press Secretary Caroline [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=0.0s)]
*  Levitt in the courtroom today. Caroline, let's get your take on today's events and maybe dovetail [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=5.04s)]
*  off of what Professor Turley was saying. Well, today was an absolute dumpster fire [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=10.64s)]
*  for the Biden campaign, Sean. They woke up to a headline in Politico that the Democrat Party is in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  a full-blown freakout over Joe Biden's failing and desperate campaign. And a couple hours later, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  they showed up to the criminal courthouse in Manhattan. Joe Biden's spokesperson was holding [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=25.68s)]
*  a press conference, all but conceding that this entire case comes from the top. It comes from [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=30.88s)]
*  crooked Joe Biden, who is using Alvin Bragg as a far left prosecutor because no other prosecutor [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=36.56s)]
*  in America in their right mind would proceed with this case other than Alvin Bragg, who has Trump [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=42.0s)]
*  derangement syndrome. And who is the star guest at that press conference outside the courthouse [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=46.72s)]
*  today? Robert De Niro, an out of touch elitist actor from Hollywood, because those are the only [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=51.6s)]
*  people left in this country who support Joe Biden. And he went on an unhinged tirade about [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=57.68s)]
*  President Trump. You know what he didn't mention? The real problems that Americans are facing, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=63.04s)]
*  the fact that they are petrified about this weaponized government that Joe Biden is leading, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=67.52s)]
*  the fact that inflation is robbing them of thousands of dollars every single month, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=72.72s)]
*  the fact that we have a wide open border because of Joe Biden's weakness that has allowed an [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  invasion of millions of illegal criminals and terrorists into our great country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=82.0s)]
*  Joe Biden's campaign is so desperate that was outside the courtroom and then inside the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=87.36s)]
*  courtroom. The George Soros funded prosecution completely imploded. They have lost the plot. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=91.52s)]
*  It took them more than four hours to conclude their closing arguments because they don't have [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=98.32s)]
*  a crime and they know it. They've been doing legal gymnastics with this jury. And I feel [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=103.04s)]
*  sorry for the jury because they've wasted six weeks of their life listening to this crap from [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  George Soros's team, Joe Biden's team, Alvin Bragg's team and Judge Mershon, who is a highly [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=114.64s)]
*  conflicted judge who has overseen it all. What is your take on the judge allowing, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=120.4s)]
*  as Jonathan Turley was talking about in detail, all of this information to go out there [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=126.4s)]
*  the jury's been told dozens of times payments were campaign violations. The judge let that false [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=133.84s)]
*  claim without any evidence go uncontradicted in this case. What's your take on that? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=139.6s)]
*  It's unbelievable to witness the sheer bias of this judge. And every time our defense team proposes [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=144.64s)]
*  an objection, he totally overrules it. But he has all the patience in the world for the prosecution. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=153.04s)]
*  He has the entire time. And as Professor Turley pointed out, he denied a key witness in this case [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  who would have proved that there was no federal campaign violation. That's why the FEC didn't [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  bring this case up in the first place. That's why Joe Biden's Justice Department even passed on this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  case. And so did Alvin Bragg's predecessor in the DA's office, Cy Vance. They all passed on this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=174.8s)]
*  case because there is no crime. The judge knows that and he's a highly conflicted judge for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=180.4s)]
*  reasons that President Trump can't even talk about because he imposed an unconstitutional [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=186.64s)]
*  gag order on the president because he doesn't want President Trump to expose the truth about [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=191.04s)]
*  his corruption. That's why he did not step in and stop this uncontradicted false narrative to go [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  forward in closing arguments today. Outrageous. Beyond anything I've ever heard or seen in my life. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=205.04s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGWnoIY2LA&t=210.72s)]
