# Newt Gingrich: Biden is feeling ‘angry’
**Fox News:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg)
*  Here with reaction Fox News contributor former speaker of the house new kingrich [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, this is a much better night [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=4.1s)]
*  Kalista will be less angry about tonight's question rather than whoopee Goldberg and her question. What was your? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=6.2s)]
*  Operation [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=14.4s)]
*  Destroy and dump Joe Biden is underway. It looks like it's being led by Obama. Will they be successful? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=16.16s)]
*  I'm not sure [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=25.6s)]
*  If Biden doesn't want to leave I don't see any mechanism to make him leave [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=28.48s)]
*  He got over 14 million votes [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  Nobody else got any significant number [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=39.08s)]
*  All these people out there now [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=41.64s)]
*  So so we're supposed to be told that 14 million Democrats around the country don't matter [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Because the senator from Vermont would like Biden to step down [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  Well talk about not being part of democracy, you know [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=53.32s)]
*  The Democrats have spent three years talking about how much they love democracy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=57.68s)]
*  Except when it's inconvenient [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=61.8s)]
*  By put yourself in Biden's shoes [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=65.0s)]
*  He's very angry. He feels he's been betrayed by Obama [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=68.16s)]
*  He feels that the elites and he says this that all the elites who he thought were his friends have turned on him [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=72.32s)]
*  But he's in the White House he's got 14 million votes he has virtually every delegate [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=79.26s)]
*  So they have to create an uprising which leads over half the delegates to break their word and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=86.3s)]
*  Decide they're going to dump Biden and here's the question for who? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=94.18s)]
*  You're gonna dump Biden for for Kamala Harris. I did a column last week [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=98.5s)]
*  Describing collapsing with Kamala. I mean Kamala is much weaker than Joe Biden [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=104.82s)]
*  She was the czar of the border for three and a half years and went to the border one time [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=110.18s)]
*  Well eight or nine or ten million people were coming across illegally one time [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=116.02s)]
*  If I were you know, normal Republican, I'd say make my day, you know, give me Kamala don't worry about Joe [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=122.42s)]
*  But why would Joe do that and I don't say I don't see Joe and Hunter and Jill [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  Getting in a room and going gee, I guess we ought to go back to Delaware to make all of our friends happy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=135.72s)]
*  I've what I see him doing is every time somebody walks in and says you ought to leave they just check off enemy [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=141.2s)]
*  Enemy enemy and remember the cognitive decline he's getting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=148.76s)]
*  Very often manifests itself as anger and as rejection of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=153.86s)]
*  Reality, so anybody who's dealt with a relative who said these kind of problems knows they can get very stubborn [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=159.3s)]
*  They can be they can suddenly have bursts of temper [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=166.82000000000002s)]
*  And my guess is that Joe Biden if Barack Obama went to see him tomorrow [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=170.66000000000003s)]
*  Biden would just say I am really deeply disappointed in you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=175.3s)]
*  I served you loyally and you stabbed me in the back and I don't think that would affect him and make him leave. I [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=178.7s)]
*  Think you're probably right. I think that would happen [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  It's very interesting. I think I agree with Ari in a lot of ways that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=190.33999999999997s)]
*  In a certain way tonight was a successful night for Biden [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  You know putting aside mixing up Putin and Zelensky and calling Donald Trump vice president Trump [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=199.42s)]
*  Short of that and short of the usual as I've been saying the whispering the yelling the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  the high energy low energy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=214.1s)]
*  I mean, it's been there for all of these years and and then I go back to the big issue of what is [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=216.7s)]
*  You know what Mike Johnson referred to as the biggest cover-up in American politics in history [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=223.42s)]
*  At least it's up there your thoughts as a historian [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=227.82s)]
*  Well, I think you could make an argument that is probably the biggest collective cover-up [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=230.5s)]
*  Woodrow Wilson had a stroke and his wife took care of him for about the last eight months of the presidency [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=236.78s)]
*  And she really made the decisions and wouldn't let anyone else in the room, but that was an unusual moment [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=242.58s)]
*  People knew he was ill. I think the degree to which [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=248.46s)]
*  people [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=252.66s)]
*  Particularly like the New York Times [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=254.18s)]
*  NBC News [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=256.3s)]
*  Particularly like the New York Times [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=258.06s)]
*  NBC etc the degree to which they refused [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=260.06s)]
*  To see what was happening in front of the very eyes is astonishing and had they told the truth [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=264.14000000000004s)]
*  He wouldn't be the nominee and we wouldn't be where we are right now [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=270.3s)]
*  All right, mr. Speaker as always [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhLOmWTw-jg&t=275.3s)]
