# Marco Rubio: Biden has to answer for all of this
**Fox News:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM)
*  And tonight, a horrific new poll for the Biden administration as the border crisis is raging [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=0.0s)]
*  out of control. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  A brand-new Gallup survey shows immigration now the top concern for the American people, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  beating issue number two, the government itself, by eight points. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=13.84s)]
*  You have a separate Monmouth University poll also showing a majority of respondents, 53%, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=16.96s)]
*  now favor building a wall on our southern border. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=24.12s)]
*  This is the first time that a majority of you, the American people, support that policy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=27.14s)]
*  It is no surprise Americans are fed up, and we are now seeing what are deadly consequences [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=32.22s)]
*  of Biden's border crisis, like never before. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=37.78s)]
*  The illegal immigrant who was charged with killing the Georgia nursing student, Lakin [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=40.86s)]
*  Riley, is now accused of, quote, listen to this, disfiguring her skull. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=45.78s)]
*  This never should have happened. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=51.32s)]
*  We had one, not one, but two opportunities to deport this illegal immigrant from Venezuela. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=53.46s)]
*  Will anyone ever ask Joe Biden what he has to say to the family of this young woman? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=60.78s)]
*  This is all directly connected to Joe Biden's disastrous policies that he lied about and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=66.5s)]
*  denied for three long years and not vetting nearly 10 million illegal immigrants he's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=72.34s)]
*  allowed into this country. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  You can put part of the blame on New York's sanctuary city policies, because they arrested [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=81.6s)]
*  this guy and, of course, let him go. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  If you beat up cops in Times Square, no worries, no bail. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  They'll let you go, too. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=92.56s)]
*  Then you can flip the double bird to the people of New York on your way out to the sanctuary [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  state of California and get your free healthcare, education, food, housing and everything else [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=98.34s)]
*  you need. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=104.22s)]
*  Only now, amidst all of this chaos, all of a sudden, Joe Biden that said, the border [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=105.38s)]
*  is secure, the border is closed, now all of a sudden he's blaming Republicans, saying, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=111.22s)]
*  I've done all that I can, and they won't help me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=116.86s)]
*  And now he's planning to visit the border on Thursday by going to Brownsville in Texas, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=120.1s)]
*  a reliably blue city deep in South Texas, where, by the way, a whopping only 12 people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=125.41999999999999s)]
*  apprehended trying to cross yesterday, and Joe is going to the border the same day that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  President Trump is going. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  But just like in East Palestine, Ohio, where he was a year late and a dollar short, Joe [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=138.92s)]
*  is, what, three years and nearly 10 million unfettered Joe Biden, illegal immigrants, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=144.48s)]
*  allowed into our country, coming from countries like Iran and Syria, Egypt and Afghanistan, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=151.48s)]
*  and yep, China and Russia. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  It is nothing in the case of Biden on Thursday, a cynical, sick political stunt by the president, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=159.98s)]
*  and frankly, it is beyond disgraceful. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=166.1s)]
*  We will be at the border with President Trump on Thursday. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=168.46s)]
*  His policies actually worked. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=171.66s)]
*  Here with reaction, Florida Senator Marco Rubio. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=173.18s)]
*  Senator, all my apologies for moving to your state. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=176.26s)]
*  You're now officially my senator, but I will take you over Chuck Schumer any day of the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=178.98s)]
*  week, and the people have been nothing but warm, gracious and welcoming to me. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=183.9s)]
*  It's great to finally make the choice to move down here, and I'm glad to be here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=188.82s)]
*  I love the state of Florida. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=193.78s)]
*  Let's get your reaction of Biden finally showing up at the border. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=195.7s)]
*  Well, 6.2 million people later. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=198.7s)]
*  That's what's happened in the last three years since he's taken over. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=201.94s)]
*  There's 6.2 million people in this country illegally that he released. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  And so you take 6.2 million people from anywhere on the planet or anywhere, and you put them [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=209.5s)]
*  and some percentage of them are going to be criminals. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=213.76s)]
*  We're seeing that now. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=216.14s)]
*  In particular, we're seeing members of a vicious gang that left Venezuela, and they [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=217.17999999999998s)]
*  were terrorizing people in Peru. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=221.54s)]
*  They were terrorizing people in Colombia. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=223.22s)]
*  They were terrorizing people in Ecuador. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=224.94s)]
*  And now they've started to make their way into the United States. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=226.88s)]
*  And just the last week, just today, it was announced that a migrant here illegally released [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=228.7s)]
*  by Biden has been—has sex charges filed against him, and the victim is 14 years old. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=233.77999999999997s)]
*  You've highlighted this horrible murder in Georgia. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=239.38s)]
*  You've seen the crime on the streets in New York and in Chicago, and it's only going [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=241.82s)]
*  to get worse. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  These people aren't committing crimes because they're migrants. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=246.9s)]
*  They're committing crimes because they're criminals. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  And they're just allowing him to release them right into the country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=251.3s)]
*  And then sometimes they're interacting with law enforcement, like in the case of the murderer [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=255.38000000000002s)]
*  in Georgia. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=258.78000000000003s)]
*  He was actually arrested in New York, and they released him. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  They let him go. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=262.34000000000003s)]
*  There was a benchworn out for him at the time of this murder. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  So the president has to answer for all of this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=265.66s)]
*  And the way he fixes this is by reinstalling the Trump policies that enforce the law. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=268.38s)]
*  But he won't do it, because it would require him to admit that Trump was right. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=274.56s)]
*  And so we're going to continue with this mess. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=278.9s)]
*  And God forbid Joe Biden is re-elected. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=280.85999999999996s)]
*  Four more years of this, we're going to have 10, 12, 15 million people released into this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=283.2s)]
*  country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  This is not immigration. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  We've got to stop calling it immigration. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not immigration. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  This is a mass migration. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  This is an invasion of the country. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=292.96s)]
*  No other country in the world would tolerate it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=294.64s)]
*  And we are paying the price for it right now, in real time, with real American victims. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=296.52s)]
*  And we saw this—again, we saw this with this young nursing student in Georgia. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  I can only imagine how this girl's family feels. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=305.64s)]
*  You don't ever recover from something like that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=309.47999999999996s)]
*  But there's an even greater danger. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=312.28s)]
*  I mean, we've been chronicling all of the people coming from countries like Iran, number [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=313.96s)]
*  one state sponsor of terror, their satellites, Syria, Egypt, the home of the Muslim Brotherhood, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=319.52s)]
*  Afghanistan, home of al-Qaeda, our number one, number two geopolitical foe, China, Russia. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=327.96s)]
*  We have tens and tens of thousands. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=333.8s)]
*  You don't have to be a rocket scientist, Senator, to figure out that not all of them [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  are coming from these hostile regimes because they want a better life for themselves and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=341.0s)]
*  their family. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  You have to assume that among the nearly 10 million, when you add in all the gotaways, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=346.62s)]
*  you've got to assume that many of them not being vetted are part of radical—have radical [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=352.84s)]
*  associations, and they are in this country. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=359.47999999999996s)]
*  And I would argue terror cells are being formed and have been formed, and they're plotting [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=362.32s)]
*  and planning and scheming what could be a 9-11 or worse. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=366.4s)]
*  I'd like to think that I'm wrong, but I know in my heart I am not wrong. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=370.76s)]
*  And we're going to wake up one morning, and we're going to realize that this president's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=374.28s)]
*  policies have resulted in the deaths of thousands of Americans. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=378.0s)]
*  How do we stop that? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=382.6s)]
*  How do we find these people, vet them and deport them? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=383.64s)]
*  The problem is you can't vet them, because it's not like these people are coming—in [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=387.72s)]
*  some cases they're coming with fake documents. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=390.52s)]
*  In other cases, these documents are produced in countries that will sell you a fake document [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=392.4s)]
*  without your real identity. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=396.76s)]
*  That's the fundamental problem when you allow people to come in like this. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=397.76s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=401.0s)]
*  Look, I don't need to disclose anything to tell you. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=402.0s)]
*  ISIS, al-Qaeda, Hezbollah all have desires to—I mean, we know that the Iranians are [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=405.36s)]
*  trying to assassinate former leaders in the Trump administration in this country right [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  now. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=413.88s)]
*  Every one of them is aware that the largest migratory smuggling operation in the history [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=414.88s)]
*  of the world is operating right on the border of the United States. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=420.76s)]
*  It's allowed 6 million people in. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=424.04s)]
*  These people are aware of that, and they are aware that if they send somebody here with [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=426.0s)]
*  a fake document or with a document with the wrong name on it because they bought some [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=430.0s)]
*  passport somewhere in the Western Hemisphere, they're going to be able to get into the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=433.68s)]
*  country and stay. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=437.64s)]
*  And you're absolutely right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=440.32s)]
*  Something terrible is going to happen. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=442.0s)]
*  It's just a matter of time now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=443.36s)]
*  I hope that I'm wrong. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=445.04s)]
*  I really, truly do, for the sake of our country. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=446.04s)]
*  But you can't let in 6, albeit by the end of this year, probably 10 million people or [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=448.28s)]
*  9 million people into the country and not expect that among them there aren't going [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=452.0s)]
*  to be lots of criminals and lots of terrorists, unfortunately. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=456.08s)]
*  And that's why you can't have mass migration. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  And the worst part of all of it, it was three years. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=463.5s)]
*  Joe, the vice president, Alejandro Mayorkas, Karine Jean-Pierre, Jen Psaki, oh, the border's [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=466.41999999999996s)]
*  secure, the border's closed. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=474.02s)]
*  They flat out were lying to the American people, and we were showing the images, proving that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=475.7s)]
*  they're lying, and they kept up that charade, only now that it's a political issue in an [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=480.86s)]
*  election year, oh, Joe will make the trip down to the border. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=486.34000000000003s)]
*  It is meaningless, because these are not the policies he really supports. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=491.14s)]
*  If he wanted a secure border, he could have brought back the policies that he got rid [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=496.1s)]
*  of in the first hundred days when he was in office with the stroke of a pen. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=500.78000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't need the help of Congress. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=504.66s)]
*  He can re-institute the policies that Trump had that were working. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=506.66s)]
*  He won't do it, will he? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=510.38s)]
*  He won't, because he has a radical base on his party that believes in open borders, and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  that believes it's inhumane to return anybody back. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=516.14s)]
*  He has turned the exceptions of all odds into the rule, and the result is 6.2 million people [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=518.62s)]
*  and climbing every single day, and we're heading in a bad direction. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=524.18s)]
*  Something bad's going to happen. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=527.54s)]
*  It really is, and it's unfortunate, and it'll be Joe Biden's fault. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=528.54s)]
*  Let me tell you, they have blood on their hands. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=532.1s)]
*  Let's just be, let's say it's called for what it is. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=533.98s)]
*  They have blood on their hands. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=536.58s)]
*  This is beyond a dereliction of duty. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=538.86s)]
*  They've been aiding and abetting and the law-breaking and facilitating the law-breaking the entire [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=540.66s)]
*  time. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=545.2199999999999s)]
*  It's unconscionable. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=546.2199999999999s)]
*  Anyway, Senator, good to see you. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YtGTuPwrM&t=547.2199999999999s)]
