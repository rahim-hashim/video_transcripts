# Anti-Israel protests at US universities spur viral backlash from Iranian-born lawyer
**Fox News:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc)
*  Now tensions they continue to build in the Middle East tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran is now warning Israel not to respond to its direct drone missile attacks saying [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  that quote nothing will remain of Israel if they launch even the tiniest invasion against [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=12.48s)]
*  Iran. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Now the Prime Minister of Israel, Bibi Netanyahu, he fired back right away asserting that quote [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Israel will do whatever it needs to defend itself. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=24.52s)]
*  Nine words that Iran would be pretty wise to listen to. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=28.96s)]
*  And this continuing crisis overseas it is having real world effects right here at home. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=33.52s)]
*  A group of anti-Israeli students took over one of the lawns of the campus of Columbia [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=38.24s)]
*  University today in New York City. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=43.2s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=45.92s)]
*  Anti-Israeli demonstrators are still there even at this hour rallying outside the campus gates. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=47.8s)]
*  Now these demonstrations come as the university's president and board co-chairs were on Capitol [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  Hill today trying to explain the steps they have taken to address this rampant anti-Semitism [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=58.76s)]
*  on their campus. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=64.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=65.94s)]
*  Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Columbia's code of conduct? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=67.32s)]
*  Mr. Greenwald? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=72.08s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=73.08s)]
*  Ms. Shipman? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=75.12s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=76.12s)]
*  Dr. Shafik? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=77.12s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=78.12s)]
*  And Professor Shizer? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=79.28s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=80.68s)]
*  We've also brought on other law enforcement experts, rewritten our rules, beefed up our [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=82.12s)]
*  enforcement process. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=86.36s)]
*  We've suspended two student groups for noncompliance, more than a dozen individual students, and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=88.12s)]
*  we discipline faculty members. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=93.44s)]
*  We have mechanisms that are now being enforced, and on my watch, they will be enforced. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=95.4s)]
*  I think many of these appointments were made in the past in a different era, and that era [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=102.2s)]
*  is done. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=110.28s)]
*  And while these crazed protesters claim to be standing up for Muslim communities in the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  Iranian American lawyer activist, Elika Laban, is reminding them that they might want to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  do a little more research. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=123.2s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=124.72s)]
*  If you had listened to us for the past two years, much less the past 45 years, you'd [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=125.72s)]
*  know that Iranians don't want war with Israel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=131.32s)]
*  We want peace with Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=133.84s)]
*  Iranian people inside of Iran have come out and said this over and over and over again. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=135.84s)]
*  It's you that wants war with Israel. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=140.44s)]
*  It's your hatred for Israel and your hatred for Jews that's pulling us into a war that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=142.6s)]
*  we didn't ask for. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=147.16s)]
*  Have we not suffered enough for the past 45 years that we now have to be used as pawns [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=148.28s)]
*  for your fantasies about war with Israel? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=153.64s)]
*  Leave us alone. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=155.84s)]
*  We don't want that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=157.32s)]
*  That video has gone viral. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  Elika Laban joins us now, along with Israeli special ops veteran Aaron Kohn is with us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Elika, you want to be very, very clear here, and I would argue Donald Trump, by enforcing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=166.64s)]
*  sanctions, was literally draining the resources that Iran uses to fund the Houthi rebels, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=172.16s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah, their proxy wars, their attacks against Israel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=181.12s)]
*  And you are beginning to see young people, as you describe, that are anti-the Islamic [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=187.2s)]
*  Republic join and stand up against the regime. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=194.16s)]
*  We had seen videos of these protests. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  It's all gone away because Joe Biden's made the Iranian mullahs rich again. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=201.04s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=204.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, he has failed to enforce the sanctions after the maximum pressure campaign. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=205.36s)]
*  The oil exports in Iran have reached the highest that they've been in the past five years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=213.6s)]
*  That seriously weakened the Iranian people's revolution since the Masajidina Amini revolution [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=218.8s)]
*  kicked off. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=224.32s)]
*  It has empowered the mullahs. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=225.7s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=227.32s)]
*  What has the reaction been to this video? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=229.4s)]
*  Are you surprised it's gone as viral as it has? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=231.28s)]
*  You know, I am to an extent. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=236.24s)]
*  I didn't think anybody was listening to us. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  They hadn't been listening to us for the past couple of years. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  We'd been trying to explain that this was a radicalization process that had been building [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=245.52s)]
*  since October 7th. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=250.4s)]
*  We'd been trying to explain that the end of this radicalization would result in support [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=252.12s)]
*  for the Islamic regime. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  And now we are seeing the results of that, everything that we'd warned about. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=259.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=263.5s)]
*  Aaron, let me bring you in here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=264.5s)]
*  You know, I never thought I'd see a day where we'd have a U.S. president with zero moral [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=266.06s)]
*  clarity that cared more about reelection and losing the base of his party that has been [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=270.97999999999996s)]
*  so radicalized that they, after losing 1,200 Israelis in the worst terror attack in Israel's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=276.7s)]
*  history and then hearing the stories of rape and murder and hostage taking, that somehow [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  the United States of America would not stand with Israel in their war to win against terror. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=290.38s)]
*  In this particular case, not stand with Israel and their right to defend themselves against [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=297.64s)]
*  the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=304.46000000000004s)]
*  I found that morally repugnant, repulsive and frankly, probably the worst thing that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden has done as president. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=312.54s)]
*  And the list is pretty long. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=314.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, Sean, I agree with you 100 percent. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=316.38s)]
*  So does everybody in Israel to an extent. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=319.62s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=322.82s)]
*  Biden's don't policy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=324.18s)]
*  Let me make this real clear. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=325.18s)]
*  Is very dangerous in the world of counterterrorism. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=327.06s)]
*  When we have an expression in Hebrew, or in this case, which is a farce. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=329.66s)]
*  Biden not only doesn't speak the language, he doesn't understand the mindset in the Middle [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=336.42s)]
*  And the way things work in the Middle East is there's three languages. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=340.38s)]
*  There's Hebrew, there's Arabic, throwing some farce and there's strength. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=343.26s)]
*  And you don't have peace in the Middle East, Sean, unless you have strength. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=348.3s)]
*  Israel must counterattack Iran. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=352.38s)]
*  They'll do it without the support of the United States. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=355.98s)]
*  All I have to say is thank God Israel has a multi-layered missile defense system, because [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=358.78s)]
*  Because unlike Joe Biden's multi-failure policy with Iran, Israel will go on the offensive. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=364.54s)]
*  Submissiveness and passiveness, Israel does not have the luxury for. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=372.38s)]
*  It must be aggressive. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=377.94s)]
*  And it's the only language that the Middle East understands. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=379.9s)]
*  And we understand it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=383.58s)]
*  We speak the language. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=384.94s)]
*  We know the culture. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=386.02s)]
*  We know the mindset. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=387.02s)]
*  And right now Israel is going to sweat those generals from the IRGC out, because the idea [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=388.02s)]
*  of getting killed is pretty bad. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=393.02s)]
*  And we're going to let them sweat it out a little bit. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=394.46s)]
*  Well, they can sweat it out, but I will tell you, if Israel does not respond, it will only [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=396.94s)]
*  embolden the mullahs in Iran. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=401.26s)]
*  They will strike again. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=403.26s)]
*  Ellicott, do you support, after watching what was unfolding on Saturday night, do you support [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=404.78s)]
*  Israel and their, whatever response they deem appropriate after the 300 missiles, etc. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=411.34s)]
*  Drones were fired into their country, unprovoked? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=418.29999999999995s)]
*  You know, we, we, we, I mean, you know, we've been saying this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=422.86s)]
*  We just, we've wanted peace this whole time. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=426.54s)]
*  We didn't want a war. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=429.1s)]
*  It was this failure of the Biden administration and the Obama administration before him, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=430.22s)]
*  continuously empowering the mullahs, getting into this JCPOA deal, engaging in diplomatic [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=435.98s)]
*  relations, unfreezing $150 billion, billions and billions more in these hostage deals [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=442.22s)]
*  that we repeatedly warned them would result in more regional and domestic terrorism that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=448.94s)]
*  have brought us to this moment where we are at, at, at a juncture that, you know, none of us know [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=453.02s)]
*  how to get out of this at this point. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=459.9s)]
*  You know, I don't want to see war against my country and my people and to put my people's [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=461.9s)]
*  lives at risk. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=467.42s)]
*  And this is exactly what I was talking about. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=467.98s)]
*  The Republic that is, but the mullahs, but the mullahs in charge of your country launched [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=469.58s)]
*  this attack against Israel. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=474.94s)]
*  If Israel does not respond, it'll be viewed as weakness. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=477.18s)]
*  We all understand that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=481.42s)]
*  And I think they have, they have a moral obligation to respond so that otherwise this will keep [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=483.1s)]
*  happening again. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=488.38s)]
*  Do you support Israel and their right to fire back at the regime that took them on? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=489.58s)]
*  It's really hard to answer that question. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=498.62s)]
*  I, I feel that the tensions are going to keep escalating and I think this is going to turn [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=500.54s)]
*  into a world war. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=504.38s)]
*  And that's what I'm very apparent. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=505.42s)]
*  So Israel should just do nothing and, and the, and the number one state sponsor terror [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=506.94s)]
*  that that has been funding the Houthi rebels, Hamas, Hezbollah. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=511.9s)]
*  They get away with continuing, you know, all these attacks against an innocent democracy. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=516.38s)]
*  Well, I think if there are strikes, it definitely shouldn't be on, you know, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=523.18s)]
*  Sean, if I can jump in real quick, I'd like to say one thing to Elica Sean. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=527.34s)]
*  Can I say one thing real quick? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=531.18s)]
*  Israel, which means Israel stands with the people of Iran. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=533.02s)]
*  I speak Farsi. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=541.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=543.98s)]

*  All right. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=546.78s)]
*  Well, maybe, maybe peace can begin right here on this show because I feel sorry for all of [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=547.34s)]
*  the people that are caught up in all of this and living under the regime that believes [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JUrf-7dlc&t=552.6999999999999s)]
