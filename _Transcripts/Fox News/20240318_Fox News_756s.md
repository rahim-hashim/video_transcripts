# Sean Hannity: The Democrats are desperate
**Fox News:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ)
*  Welcome to Hannity. This Monday night. Wow. A lot of news tonight. Tonight, Joe Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=0.0s)]
*  reportedly anxious and angry over his reelection prospects. Why? Poll after poll after poll. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=6.08s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump is beating the current president. Demographically, Joe is losing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  huge parts of his base. He's losing huge numbers with African Americans, Hispanic Americans, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=18.28s)]
*  young people, suburban moms. They're leaving him. And now Democrats, the Biden campaign, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=24.8s)]
*  the mob in the media, they are all desperate. And I mean desperate. Now, some would even [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=30.44s)]
*  say that, well, the left is bracing for a political bloodbath, which is why they are [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=35.24s)]
*  desperately now praying that Donald Trump spends the next 231 days in courtrooms all [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=41.42s)]
*  across America in the hopes that Joe Biden's weaponized Department of Justice can help [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Joey win the day. But whatever you do, just don't call it a bloodbath or Democrats. They [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=51.72s)]
*  will accuse you of fomenting violence. The same people that said the 574 riots in the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=57.88s)]
*  summer of 2020 that killed dozens of Americans, injured thousands of cops, pelted with bricks, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=63.92s)]
*  rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails and caused billions in property damage. They claim they [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=70.32s)]
*  were mostly peaceful. Now, more desperation on their part. Over the weekend, Trump used [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=75.8s)]
*  the phrase to describe the potential economic fallout of a second Joe Biden term. But according [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  to the left and their allies in the mob and the media, Trump committed a mortal sin with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=87.48s)]
*  a threatening call to arms. And what is now even a deleted post, our old friend, liberal [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=92.84s)]
*  Joe Scarborough, breathlessly stating, following quote, Donald Trump's America, and he is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=98.28s)]
*  proud of it, promised another bloodbath if he loses again. You mean like the riots in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=104.36s)]
*  2020 that liberals said were mostly peaceful? Anyway, now this is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=109.8s)]
*  But before we get to all the insane hysteria and we've got great montages tonight and the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=115.0s)]
*  blatant hypocrisy, let's just listen to former president Trump's full remarks. Let's actually [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=120.92s)]
*  play them in context in his own words. No editing. Take a look. Let me tell you something to China. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=127.16s)]
*  If you're listening, President Xi and you and I are friends, but he understands the way I deal, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=134.36s)]
*  those big monster car manufacturing plants that you're building in Mexico right now, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=139.4s)]
*  and you think you're going to get that you're going to not hire Americans and you're going to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=146.12s)]
*  sell the cars to us now, we're going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=150.12s)]
*  line. And you're not going to be able to sell those guys. If I get elected. Now, if I don't get [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=156.6s)]
*  elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole. That's going to be the least of it. It's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=161.88s)]
*  going to be a bloodbath for the country. That'll be the least of it. And he talks about cars again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=166.52s)]
*  He was talking about the cars and the auto industry. You just heard the speech. The president [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  was discussing the automobile industry. If you have a brain and brain and any intellectual honesty, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=176.68s)]
*  you will admit that and acknowledge that. But let's see how the Democrats and the lying, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=182.52s)]
*  corrupt media mob, their best friends and their chief donors characterize these remarks. This [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  should not shock you, but take a look anyway. One specific remark from Donald Trump's rally [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=193.32s)]
*  on Saturday has set off a political firestorm, but is it possible the firestorm is missing what [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  should be of real concern? We have, we just have to win this election because he's even predicting [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=205.48s)]
*  a bloodbath. What does that mean? He's going to exact a bloodbath. There's something wrong here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=212.28s)]
*  When the former president who's already incited violence among his followers says that there's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=217.88s)]
*  going to be a bloodbath, what after the election, if he does not win, he is telling us what he is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=222.6s)]
*  going to do. A major party candidate is saying you elect me. There's going to be dictatorship, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=230.04s)]
*  bloodbath, violence, retribution against my political enemies. That equals what we saw in Italy [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=236.2s)]
*  and Germany and other places. If you look at the way he said this, it's going to be a bloodbath for [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=242.84s)]
*  the whole, then he stops. That's going to be the least of it. That's going to be the least of it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=247.88s)]
*  It's going to be a bloodbath for the country. Obviously, he's talking about a bloodbath for [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=253.32s)]
*  America. It's laid out in the terms of it. And these idiots on Twitter, these idiots on cable [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=258.52s)]
*  news, these idiots on Sunday shows, when presidents, you know, he was talking only about the auto [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=267.56s)]
*  industry and this is one more, it's just bull. Let me say that at 6 15 a.m. It's just bull. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=274.12s)]
*  I mean, you got to laugh. Just, you know, full blown lying, dishonesty, hysteria from NBC, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=283.4s)]
*  CBS, fake news, CNN, MSDNC, the New York Times, pretty much everyone in the Democratic Party, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=290.67999999999995s)]
*  every single quote mainstream media outlet, there's flat out lying to your face. Now, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=297.64s)]
*  Trump's full remarks are on tape. He's clearly not calling for political violence at all. In fact, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  he is using, well, let's say a pretty normal analogy. As a matter of fact, this phrase, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=309.96s)]
*  pay attention, liberal Joe, is very common on the left. Let's remind you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=316.2s)]
*  You know, Republicans understand that they're headed for another potential electoral blood [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=321.4s)]
*  bath quickly. It's still not clear that Donald Trump will in fact testify because they think [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=327.4s)]
*  that would be a bit of a blood bath. Major universities bracing for a bleak financial [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=333.08s)]
*  situation. Why one expert is predicting a blood bath as classes resume this fall. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=338.12s)]
*  But as Politico.com reports tonight on the quote blood bath at the RNC coming out of Iowa, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=343.56s)]
*  they were promising that this was effectively going to be a blood bath. Not only is it going [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=349.48s)]
*  to be a blood bath, but after they leave New Hampshire, it's a blood bath on her home turf. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=353.24s)]
*  That's really tough. Trump has left a lot of corpses in his wake. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=357.56s)]
*  The thing I fear most is if he doesn't run, there's going to be a blood bath of the Democratic Party. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  Because the battle is already on. Donald Trump is going to win this nomination and we need to be [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=366.92s)]
*  ready for that. It is a long fight ahead. I'm not going to sugarcoat it for anybody. People who [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  don't think this election is going to be a blood bath are mistaken. As the administration [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=376.6s)]
*  braces itself for a blood bath in 2018 and a wave of staff departures. We're going to begin [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=382.20000000000005s)]
*  right off the bat with some breaking news in our money lead and what's being described as a market [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  blood bath. It's like we're doing just great in Georgia and you know, Ohio. Good God, was that a [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  blood bath the other night? Florida is going to be a political blood bath for Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  You can't make it up, can you? Even Joe Biden himself, he used the term in 2020 telling donors [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=401.16s)]
*  that the Bernie Sanders campaign might cause a primary blood bath. And here's where it gets the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=408.76000000000005s)]
*  most interesting. Democrats, the mob, the media, they have done far worse than use the term blood [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=415.0s)]
*  bath in a political analogy in recent years. Some actually even call him for Donald Trump's [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=421.88s)]
*  assassination. Others including your vice president, Kamala Harris, member of the bail [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=428.28s)]
*  fund. She tweeted out after the precinct and Minneapolis was burned to the ground and they're [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=433.64s)]
*  not going to stop. We're not going to stop encouraging the rioting and that summer of love [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=439.23999999999995s)]
*  and promoting the bail fund for dangerous criminals. Many have stated publicly they wanted [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=444.2s)]
*  to punch Trump in the face or as Joe Biden said, I wish we were in high school so I could take him [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=449.32s)]
*  behind the gym. Well, if there's a windstorm, Joe may be blown over. The Senate majority leader, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=454.76s)]
*  Chuckie Schumer, even threatening the United States Supreme Court during a violent speech on [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  the very steps of the US Supreme Court. And that's not all. Let's take a trip down memory lane. This [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  is probably my favorite montage of the night. Take a look. Everyone beware because they're not [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=471.88s)]
*  going to stop. It is going to, they're not going to stop before election day in November and they're [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=478.28s)]
*  not going to stop after election day. There needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=482.12s)]
*  unrest in our lives and unfortunately there's plenty to go around. I just don't even know why [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  there aren't uprisings all over the country. Maybe there will be. Yes, I have thought an awful lot [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=490.6s)]
*  about blowing up the White House. When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=498.04s)]
*  I want to clarify, I'm not an actor. I lie for a living. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=503.8s)]
*  However, it's been a while and maybe it's time. How dare he say the things he does? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  Of course I want to punch him in the face. Right, yes. If you see anybody from that cabinet [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=519.24s)]
*  in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=525.96s)]
*  crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome. Michelle says that you know [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=533.48s)]
*  when they go low we go up. No, no. When they go low we kick them. I'll put Mr. Burgess up against [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=541.24s)]
*  Sean Hannity. He'll tear him up. The press always asks me don't I wish I were debating him. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=549.8s)]
*  No, I wish you were in high school I could take him behind the gym. That's what I wish. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=557.0s)]
*  I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=561.56s)]
*  and you will pay the price. Was that Obama wanting somebody to beat me up? I'll take him on, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=568.76s)]
*  whoever Mr. Burgess is, if he wants to you know bring it on. Anyway keep in mind there was no [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=577.16s)]
*  media hysteria after the violent rhetoric, none. But they take the words of Donald Trump completely [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=583.0s)]
*  out of context. They pretend that we are facing an existential crisis and this is what they do [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=589.0s)]
*  every day. The top donors to the Biden campaign this year like in 2020, like Hillary Clinton in [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=594.92s)]
*  2016 will be the mob in the media. Not to be outdone the Biden campaign actually released this [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=601.96s)]
*  new disgusting dishonest ad. Take a look. Now if I don't get elected it's going to be a bloodbath [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9iHR0XF3xQ&t=607.64s)]
