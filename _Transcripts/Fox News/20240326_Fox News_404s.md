# ‘BEAT DOWN’: Sen. Kennedy destroys Dems’ climate witness
**Fox News:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo)
*  All right, so the Green New Deal is back, and it makes less sense than ever. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=0.0s)]
*  Two of the most liberal members of Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=3.6s)]
*  Bernie Sanders of Vermont, they recently unveiled what they call a, quote, Green New Deal for public [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=9.52s)]
*  housing. But to be fair, neither AOC or Bernie Sanders are climate experts. And by the way, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  neither are Olympic athletes. But that did not stop Senate Democrats from inviting an Olympic [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=21.84s)]
*  skier to testify at a hearing about climate change, something it ends up that it doesn't [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=27.36s)]
*  know that much about. They tried to pass him off as an expert witness. Did not go well. In fact, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=34.08s)]
*  it may be the biggest beat down in Senate history. You decide. Take a look. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=40.24s)]
*  What is carbon dioxide? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm, I went to high school, but that's a, carbon dioxide is a gas. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=48.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=54.080000000000005s)]
*  I'm not a, I'm not a, I'm not a professional to talk about carbon dioxide so much, but. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=54.64s)]
*  Is it the major part of our atmosphere? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=60.720000000000006s)]
*  It's a huge part of our atmosphere, yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  It's actually a very small part of our atmosphere. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=64.56s)]
*  Well, okay. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  If we spent those trillions of dollars and became carbon neutral by 2050 in the United States, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=68.64s)]
*  which you advocate, how much will it reduce world temperatures? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=77.36s)]
*  I don't have an answer for that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=82.16000000000001s)]
*  You don't know? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=85.2s)]
*  No. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=85.92s)]
*  You just think we ought to spend the money and then see what happens? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=86.4s)]
*  I think as an athlete, I think if we spend that money and invest in our future, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=90.64000000000001s)]
*  hopefully those temperatures stop rising. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  You think we ought to abolish the police, do you? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=99.68s)]
*  Again, not the topic I'm here to talk about today. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=101.84s)]
*  I know, but, but you tweeted it. Do you think we ought to abolish the police? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=104.0s)]
*  That's not what I'm here to talk about. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  Should we do that before or after we get rid of fossil fuels? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=109.52s)]
*  I'm not going to address that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=114.32s)]
*  Who intentionally created the war on drugs to put black people in jail? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=116.56s)]
*  Who were you talking to? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  I don't remember typing that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  You don't? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=122.8s)]
*  No. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=123.44s)]
*  I bet he wishes he's still on the slopes here with reaction. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=127.44s)]
*  Louisiana Senator John Kennedy is with us. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=130.56s)]
*  Maybe my favorite moment was when he said he didn't know how much carbon was in the atmosphere and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=133.2s)]
*  you had to tell him 0.04%. Did they portray this guy as an expert? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=138.64s)]
*  Yes. Mr. Schumacher, I understand, is a superb skier, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=149.27999999999997s)]
*  Sean, and I'm sure he's a fine young man. But the fact remains that my Democratic colleagues [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  invited Mr. Schumacher to testify before the Budget Committee of the United States Senate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  as an expert on climate change to advise us on climate change legislation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=169.28s)]
*  And Mr. Schumacher couldn't either defend nor substantiate his rhetoric. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=174.32s)]
*  I suppose his testimony is an example of the the Kardashian-ing of America. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=181.6s)]
*  I don't mean to be cruel, but Mr. Schumacher's testimony reminded me so much of the, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=191.28s)]
*  how can I put this, the gormless pop singers and movie stars who partied with Harvey Weinstein, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=200.64s)]
*  who incessantly lecture the American people, and who also have to lie down if they think too hard. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=210.24s)]
*  And I'm sorry Mr. Schumacher had a difficult day, but you shouldn't hold yourself out as an expert [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=218.24s)]
*  or have an opinion if you can't defend it. You know, you're from the South, Louisiana, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=228.88s)]
*  Senator, I'll just say, well, bless his heart, he tried. Here's the serious side of it, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  the amount of money that they are already spending, that Joe Biden is spending, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=241.36s)]
*  that the Democrats are spending, and the restrictions they want to put on every American. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=245.92s)]
*  They want to shove an EV into your driveway whether you want it or not, they want you to get rid of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  your gas stove, that'd be expensive, they want you to get new refrigerators, and they don't really [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=257.52s)]
*  like your air conditioners, nor do they like the fact that you eat meat. That'd be a problem for me, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=262.48s)]
*  considering I'm very keto friendly and eat a lot of protein and a lot of meat, Senator. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=267.44s)]
*  That'd be a problem for a lot of people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=272.32s)]
*  Well, I was reading a study this weekend, Sean, by a visiting professor at Stanford, and he says [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=276.24s)]
*  that the cost to make the world carbon neutral by 2050 and to sustain it until 2100 would be $27 [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=283.44s)]
*  trillion a year. That's about $2000 trillion. That's not a plan, that's a fantasy, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=296.48s)]
*  because countries like China and Russia and Iran and Sub-Sahara Africa, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=307.12s)]
*  India, are going to expect the American people to pay for it, and we don't have the money, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=314.16s)]
*  and I think President Biden is planning on having the American people pay for it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=321.68s)]
*  Even if we do our part, we can't depend upon China to do anything other than what is in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=328.16s)]
*  its self-interest, or at least the self-interest of the Communist Party of China, and they will [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  be happy to see us spend all of our money while they spend zero and weaken our country. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=341.92s)]
*  I don't think we could pay for his immigration plans, his radical climate plans. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=350.08s)]
*  I think the country's in a lot of trouble in 224 days if that man got re-elected. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=356.08s)]
*  How are you feeling about the race? We have about 30 seconds. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=360.88s)]
*  If we discovered life on Mars tomorrow, Joe Biden would send it money, I can tell you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=364.96s)]
*  I think his only plan is to put a reverse mortgage on Alaska and keep spending, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  but it's not working. Senator, you are a total gentleman today, and I felt bad for the young man. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=378.96s)]
*  I think he probably wishes he stayed on the slopes, but we appreciate your time as always. Great job [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j359sN4NJGo&t=387.12s)]
