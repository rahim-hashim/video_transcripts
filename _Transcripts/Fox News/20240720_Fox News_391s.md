*  Here with more on the man of the hour, Donald Trump, RNC co-chair Laura Trump and the president's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=0.0s)]
*  granddaughter, Kai Trump is with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=7.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=10.28s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=11.28s)]
*  Do I even need to say anything? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  This is for Kai. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  She was incredible last night. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  And we are so proud in our family of Kai. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=16.44s)]
*  No one more proud, of course, than her dad and grandpa, my father-in-law. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=19.28s)]
*  What an amazing job. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=24.04s)]
*  I think we're going to see her a lot in the future, Kai. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=25.04s)]
*  I think so, too. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=27.16s)]
*  I hate to tell you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=28.16s)]
*  Welcome to the family. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=29.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=31.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=32.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=33.32s)]
*  It's such a delight to have you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=34.32s)]
*  So your dad was on with me the other night. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=35.32s)]
*  Well, actually, he was on radio today and he told me this story. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=37.12s)]
*  You called your dad and you said, I'd like to give a speech. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=41.4s)]
*  Yes, on Monday. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=45.44s)]
*  I did. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=46.44s)]
*  Tell me, I mean, this is after your grandpa was shot. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=47.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=50.68s)]
*  Scary? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=51.68s)]
*  You were fishing with your dad. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=52.68s)]
*  Yeah, I was fishing on the boat with my dad and we were with my friends and then his phone [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=53.68s)]
*  was buzzing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=57.64s)]
*  We hooked up and then the news broke and no one knew for like 90 minutes what was really [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=59.12s)]
*  going on and all we knew was that he was shot and that's it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=64.12s)]
*  What was that like for you? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=69.16s)]
*  It was scary. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=70.16s)]
*  It was really scary. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=71.16s)]
*  Like, I wish no one would ever go through that ever. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=72.16s)]
*  I was watching and, Laura, I told you this and the people I was with, I said they just [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=76.56s)]
*  killed him because I saw the blood and I thought the bullet hit the head. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=82.36s)]
*  I can't believe it just pierced his ear. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=86.44s)]
*  Now I have talked to your grandfather about you and he brags about you all the time. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=88.84s)]
*  You know that, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=94.88s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=95.88s)]
*  You know, I've got a granddaughter. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=96.88s)]
*  She's scratch. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=98.84s)]
*  She's not as good as me, but she's scratch. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=99.84s)]
*  Does he say that to you? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=101.12s)]
*  He does, yes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=102.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=104.36s)]
*  America really does need to know the truth because you are a competitive family. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=105.36s)]
*  Have you beaten your grandpa on the golf course in a head-to-head match? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=110.0s)]
*  Maybe, maybe, maybe. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=115.44s)]
*  I'm going to leave it like that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=116.44s)]
*  Just maybe. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=119.44s)]
*  What a good granddaughter. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=120.44s)]
*  What a great, that's a great granddaughter. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=121.44s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=123.44s)]
*  And can I tell you what I loved about Kai's speech? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=124.44s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=126.16s)]
*  The candy and soda. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=127.16s)]
*  Oh, the Hershey bars. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=128.16s)]
*  Always. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=129.16s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=130.16s)]
*  My kids love going to visit grandpa and they go straight in. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=131.16s)]
*  He's got a bowl of candy in his office and he loves to dose them up with candy and then [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=133.72s)]
*  hand them back to him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't give me anything. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=140.83999999999997s)]
*  I know you're missing out, Sean. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=141.83999999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry to tell you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=142.83999999999997s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=144.83999999999997s)]
*  And I was on the Trump train early. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  I know you deserve the candy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's something, really. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  You got a big decision. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  You got college coming up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  Are you excited about that? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=152.67999999999998s)]
*  I am very excited, yeah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=153.92s)]
*  I'm not going to get into where you're thinking about going, but a lot of colleges are recruiting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=154.92s)]
*  you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=159.56s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=160.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=161.56s)]
*  That's exciting, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=162.56s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=163.56s)]
*  I'm excited to see where I go in the future. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=164.56s)]
*  How was it like for you on that stage with that crowd? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=165.56s)]
*  Did you know that tens of millions of Americans were watching you? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=171.2s)]
*  I did, but once I got out there, it was just all from the heart. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=175.76s)]
*  It just flowed really easily. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=179.88s)]
*  I was nervous beforehand, but afterwards I got out there and I was just able to do it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=181.44s)]
*  And I was mad nervous. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=186.96s)]
*  Is that like draining a 30-foot putt? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=189.4s)]
*  Kind of, yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=191.52s)]
*  Is that the same thing? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=193.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=194.8s)]
*  And you're up there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=195.8s)]
*  Your dad told me something else. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=199.16s)]
*  He said it was your first public speech. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=201.28s)]
*  Yes, ever. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=203.96s)]
*  That's a big one. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=204.96s)]
*  That's a really small venue to start out on. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=206.8s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=209.16s)]
*  We go big in the Trump family. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=210.56s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=211.88s)]
*  And by the way, they don't tell any of us what to do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=212.88s)]
*  In 2016, they just threw us out on the campaign trail. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  We're just throwing Kai into the mix at the Republican National Convention and she's nailing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=217.72s)]
*  it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=222.16s)]
*  But the best part of the story to me is that you asked your dad and there's two things [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=223.64s)]
*  that your dad said to me. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=229.52s)]
*  You called and my daughter was 17. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=231.32s)]
*  My 17-year-old daughter rarely called and said, Dad, you want to go fishing or Dad, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=234.4s)]
*  you want to do anything. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=239.0s)]
*  At that point, she's kind of becoming independent. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  What made you that day call your dad and say, Dad, you want to go fishing? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=244.24s)]
*  And you brought your friends? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=247.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=248.92s)]
*  I just finished a golf tournament. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=249.92s)]
*  I came in second place and that next day I didn't want to play golf. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=251.0s)]
*  I just wanted to have a rest day. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  And I was like, OK, yeah, you want to go fishing with my friends and whatever. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=256.48s)]
*  And we went fishing and we had, it was awesome fishing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=260.48s)]
*  We got like 10 fish and then. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=263.72s)]
*  What kind of fish? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=266.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=267.8s)]
*  My dad's going to give me a math. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=268.8s)]
*  I don't know which one is which, but it was a fish. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=269.8s)]
*  Your dad's a big hunter and fisherman like Eric's a big hunter, big outdoor family. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=271.8s)]
*  You did an amazing job. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=278.04s)]
*  You showed poise and grace. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=279.36s)]
*  I mean, you kind of dazzled the nation last night. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  And I hope you're very proud of that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=286.24s)]

*  My speech, Kai's speech, we wanted to convey that this is a human being. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=317.18s)]
*  The father-in-law that I know, the grandpa that Kai knows and that my kids know, I think [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ThRNHstzbE&t=321.46000000000004s)]
