# Biden didn't know what he was signing off on: Byron Donalds
**Fox News:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU)
*  Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz, the host of Outkicks, Tommy Lahren, Fearless—Fearless [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=0.0s)]
*  is the name of it, and Florida Congressman Byron Daniels. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Congressman, let me begin with you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=12.8s)]
*  The go-to-hell remark is right on target when you think about the people that Biden commuted [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=16.64s)]
*  death penalty sentences. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=24.92s)]
*  I mean, some of these people are ruthless, despicable, heinous child killers who abducted [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=26.88s)]
*  and raped and murdered. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=34.599999999999994s)]
*  In one case, they cut a little girl's throat because she had seen her mother's murder [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=36.36s)]
*  committed by the same man four days earlier. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  And yet the families of these victims are outraged. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=45.92s)]
*  They're angry about it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=51.28s)]
*  Apparently, Joe Biden didn't even talk to them or consult them. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  What does it say about the outgoing president? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=55.76s)]
*  Well, first of all, I hope everybody had a great Christmas. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=59.4s)]
*  Congratulations to Sean Hannity on the announcement of your engagement. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=64.84s)]
*  Congratulations to you and Ainsley. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=67.84s)]
*  Look, I think what's happening with Joe Biden, nobody thinks he even knows about these [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=69.28s)]
*  clemencies or these pardons. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=74.88s)]
*  This is the radical left staff that has been running this administration for the last four [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=76.88s)]
*  years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=81.24s)]
*  So I agree with President Trump in what he said about these 37 individuals who have been [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=82.32s)]
*  granted clemency. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=87.16s)]
*  This is outrageous. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=88.16s)]
*  They should not have a Merry Christmas, to be perfectly blunt with you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  But this is because we have the radical left doing all the things they've been wanting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  to do for a very long time on their way out the door, while Joe Biden's at the beach [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=98.28s)]
*  or taking a nap or whatever it is that he's doing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=102.38s)]
*  Do you think he had any idea what he was doing? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  This is a travesty. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=107.64s)]
*  We are a country that doesn't have a president right now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=108.64s)]
*  Do you think he had any idea what he was doing? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=109.64s)]
*  Say that again, Greg? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  Do you think he knew what he was doing? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  No, I don't think he knew what he was doing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=118.92s)]
*  You know, Tommy, the State Department has now shut down this hideous center called the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=121.2s)]
*  Global Engagement Center. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=127.12s)]
*  What it really was, was a bureau that was blacklisting conservatives, suppressing their [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  speech. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=135.16s)]
*  Does this, do you think, mark a new era of free speech protections under Donald Trump? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=136.64s)]
*  I think Donald Trump's going to do whatever he can to protect free speech, and I know [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=145.4s)]
*  that that's something that's very important to him, as it is for all true Republicans [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=148.76s)]
*  and conservatives and patriots in this country, hopefully on the left and the right. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=152.92s)]
*  But I'll tell you this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=156.4s)]
*  As someone who was personally censored during the pandemic by the White House, by the Biden [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=157.4s)]
*  White House directing social media companies to personally censor me and to monkey with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  the algorithm so that my content was demoted or not seen by my followers, this is really [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=167.08s)]
*  near and dear to my heart. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=171.96s)]
*  And I think any time a government official, at least in this current administration, tells [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=173.72s)]
*  you something is misinformation or disinformation or a cheap fake or a deep fake, well, I think [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=177.12s)]
*  we know all about that at this point. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Any time they tell you something is likely a conspiracy theory, you might want to check [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  into that as well, because it seems like all of those things keep coming true. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=188.36s)]
*  It's a great victory. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=192.36s)]
*  We're wasting millions of dollars on that worthless agency, as we are wasting on many [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=193.36s)]
*  other worthless agencies. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  We can't wait for January 20th. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  We can't wait for Doge. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=200.52s)]
*  And we can't wait for the American people to once again come first in our own country, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=201.52s)]
*  a radical concept that the leftist activist journalists don't seem to like. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=206.44000000000003s)]
*  But it's coming, and it's coming quickly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=211.36s)]
*  And Donald Trump will be unstoppable. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, Jason, Guatemala, I think, caught a lot of people by surprise, saying, oh, we'll [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=216.08s)]
*  people that you deport. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=220.96s)]
*  Is Donald Trump, before he's even been sworn in, having a fairly dramatic effect on illegal [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=224.48s)]
*  immigration? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=231.8s)]
*  Oh, from the moment he was elected, he's done more to secure our border and take care [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=232.8s)]
*  of the United States on all fronts. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=239.12s)]
*  I mean, yeah, Guatemala, he put Mexico on notice. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=241.16s)]
*  The flow started, slowed down there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=244.72s)]
*  Justin Trudeau up in Canada came running to Mar-a-Lago, pleading, hoping that he could [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=247.12s)]
*  have a moment of the president's time. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=253.84s)]
*  I think he's put China on notice as it relates to the Panama Canal. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=256.12s)]
*  He's demanded that our hostages be released by Hamas, promising all kinds of chaos that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=260.76s)]
*  go on in the Middle East. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=268.04s)]
*  If those hostages are not returned, he's put Iran on notice. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=270.12s)]
*  He wants to talk to North Korea, wants to talk to the Russians. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=274.68s)]
*  I mean, this is what an active president should be doing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=278.16s)]
*  But it's so oblivious to the Biden and Harris administration. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=283.08s)]
*  They're just left. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=289.48s)]
*  Remember, they promised us, they told us that the Middle East was the calmest it had ever [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=290.48s)]
*  been, only to have the October massacre happen just literally like two weeks later. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=295.04s)]
*  So again, Donald Trump can't be in office soon enough. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, Congressman, I was really taken aback by this column in the Hill which said [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=305.6s)]
*  that Democrats sort of can and should disqualify Trump as an insurrectionist under the meaning [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=310.48s)]
*  of the Constitution. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  It's utterly absurd, quite frankly, and I know a thing or two as a lawyer about the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=319.76s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=323.76s)]
*  Are you hearing anything on the other side of the aisle about this? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=325.1s)]
*  Maybe from people like Jamie Raskin, who I recall in 2017 challenged Trump's electors [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=331.2s)]
*  and tried to install Hillary Clinton as president. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=338.72s)]
*  I mean, no, we're not heard much from the Democrats. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=342.4s)]
*  They're too busy licking their wounds and trying to figure out which way they need to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=347.12s)]
*  conduct their party. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=351.28s)]
*  But look, are they happy about the fact that Kamala Harris was blown out? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=352.48s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=356.28s)]
*  But is anybody thinking that they're going to do anything about it? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=357.46s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to be the president of the United States. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  He's going to get these elections certified on January 6. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  He's going to get inaugurated on January 20. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=367.2s)]
*  The Democrats aren't going to like it, but those are the breaks because they had an opportunity [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=369.88s)]
*  to run this country, and what they did was they ran it into the ground. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=373.76s)]
*  Massively open borders, foreign policy, that's a mess, massive inflation, censoring the American [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  The American people rejected what the radical left was doing and gave Donald Trump a political [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  mandate. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=389.36s)]
*  So whether it's Jamie Raskin or any of the Democrats that are going to be upset on January [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=390.36s)]
*  6, you only have yourself to blame. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=394.6s)]
*  You did a terrible job. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  The American people want a change, and change is coming in the form of Donald Trump. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, Tariq, the hysteria, Tommy, over Trump's victory is not limited to MSNBC [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=403.2s)]
*  and CNN. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=410.16s)]
*  Now colleges and universities are telling their international students, oh, you've [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=412.0s)]
*  got to come back here before Trump issues a travel ban, ignoring the fact, of course, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=416.52s)]
*  that he has said no such thing, that these are people with visas to be here, and that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=424.35999999999996s)]
*  Trump has actually gone so far as to say, if you graduate from college, I'm going [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=430.68s)]
*  to make sure you get green cards so you can stay here and work. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=434.68s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=438.88s)]
*  Yeah, Donald Trump wants the best and the brightest to remain in this country. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwxTdn80LU&t=440.91999999999996s)]
