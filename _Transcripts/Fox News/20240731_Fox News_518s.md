# Joe Concha: This is what Kamala Harris supports
**Fox News:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE)
*  Not as Kamala still support reparations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm sure her spokesperson will come out any day now and say, I used to, but not anymore. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=2.4s)]
*  She's still proud of that radical record as a far-left progressive. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=7.72s)]
*  Does she stand by her pastor of 25 years, who believes America is a racist country filled [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  with bad people that deserve 9-11? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=17.0s)]
*  Will anyone ask Kamala any of these questions? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=20.88s)]
*  Will state-run media, the mob, ever ask any tough questions? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=24.04s)]
*  Or will she continue to hide behind staff like a coward? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=27.92s)]
*  And when Kamala became the presumptive nominee, well, she, according to her own pastor that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=31.44s)]
*  blamed America for 9-11, called him to pray for her. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=38.72s)]
*  If that's not ignorant, blaming America for 9-11, it sounds like he kind of needs the prayers. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=44.28s)]
*  Here with reaction, author of the brand-new book, Progressively Worse, Why Today's Democrats [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=50.72s)]
*  Ain't Your Daddy's Dunkies, Amazon.com, Hannity.com, bookstores around the country, Fox News contributor [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  Joe Concha, fellow Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=63.0s)]
*  All right, Joe, let's talk about this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=66.44s)]
*  I guess this isn't the party of JFK any longer because I guess by today's standard, it's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=69.2s)]
*  he be a MAGA Republican. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Oh, this is not the party of the working man and woman as it used to claim to be, Sean. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=76.12s)]
*  JFK was for large tax cuts and beefing the military. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=82.4s)]
*  Jimmy Carter was a pro-life Democratic president, which is unheard of here in 2024. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  Bill Clinton actually worked with Newt Gingrich to establish a balanced budget American amendment [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=93.72s)]
*  and said that the era of big government was over, worked on welfare reform as well. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Barack Obama even was seen as the deporter in chief in terms of the way he handled immigration. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=105.04s)]
*  Now they embrace Kamala Harris, who is by far the most radical senator and now vice [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=110.12s)]
*  president and now presidential nominee you will ever see. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  She is for eliminating the fossil fuel industry, ending all offshore drilling, for abolishing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=121.62s)]
*  ICE. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=127.6s)]
*  She opposes remain in Mexico policy and border wall construction. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=128.6s)]
*  She supports sanctuary cities and giving free health care to illegals. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=132.36s)]
*  You mentioned before in your monologue, Sean, she wants to end all private health insurance. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=136.88s)]
*  She wants to allow violent criminals to vote from prison. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=142.4s)]
*  She doesn't believe in voter ID. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=145.78s)]
*  She does believe, however, that biological men should compete against biological women. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=147.72s)]
*  Oh, and she's for expanding the Supreme Court. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=152.32s)]
*  She's for raising taxes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=155.04s)]
*  She's for late term abortion. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=156.48s)]
*  And as far as reimagining police, that's code for defund the police. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=158.24s)]
*  And you tell that to the families of the 200 plus police officers shot in the line [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=163.36s)]
*  of duty this year. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=167.68s)]
*  And again, Kamala Harris over and over has insisted that Joe Biden is as exhausting as, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=169.58s)]
*  you know, Christian McCaffrey in private. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=175.52s)]
*  He's as sharp as John Nash. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=177.56s)]
*  She lied about his physical and mental capacities for years. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=179.56s)]
*  She covered it up. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=184.12s)]
*  It's one of the biggest cover-ups in American political history regarding Joe Biden's mental [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=185.12s)]
*  and physical fitness. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=189.56s)]
*  She's the Baghdad Bob of presidential candidates. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=191.76s)]
*  And it all goes downhill from here, by the way, because pain is temporary, film is forever. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=194.76s)]
*  And in Kamala Harris's case, her words are all on video, not from 20 years ago, from [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  just several years ago when she ran for president. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=205.16s)]
*  And she cannot escape her own record, Sean. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=207.6s)]
*  Ari. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=209.76s)]
*  You know, I'm going to scroll her radical record. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=210.76s)]
*  I mean, we've been going over it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=213.28s)]
*  I don't want to repeat myself too much. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=214.6s)]
*  And the reason I'm going to scroll it, because there's a lot of extremism here. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=217.38000000000002s)]
*  And as we've been pointing out, Ari, she's trying to walk a lot of this back, and she's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=222.18s)]
*  doing it through AIDS. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=226.26000000000002s)]
*  I don't think you can walk back how strongly she has taken positions on every one of these [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  issues. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=234.5s)]
*  Do you think that strategy works, or do people see through that? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=235.74s)]
*  Because I believe people are smarter than that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=239.86s)]
*  Well, if the Trump campaign does its job, and I do expect that they will, she won't [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=243.3s)]
*  be successful in walking it back. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=248.78s)]
*  Here's the problem, and it's a character problem. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=250.94s)]
*  When you have such a left-wing record and you know America is not a left-wing country, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=252.86s)]
*  you've got to hope that you can change all your positions. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=257.14s)]
*  Now, the problem with it for Kamala Harris is, if you can't stand by what you said yesterday, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=259.58000000000004s)]
*  today, why should we trust anything you're going to tell us tomorrow? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=265.58000000000004s)]
*  So when Kamala Harris, for example, says that Israel has a right to defend itself, that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=269.9s)]
*  America has an ironclad commitment to Israel, what will stop her from walking away from [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=274.26s)]
*  that tomorrow, if she feels like it, just as she's walked away today from her positions [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=279.26s)]
*  yesterday on fracking, on the border, on all the different issues that you all have cited [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=283.82s)]
*  so far tonight? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=288.82s)]
*  It's a character issue. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  And that's what left-wing characters have to do in order to get elected. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=291.62s)]
*  And that is the central mission of the Trump campaign now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=295.29999999999995s)]
*  Their job is to light up the night sky with illuminating flares showing just how far-out [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=299.56s)]
*  liberal left-wing Kamala Harris is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=305.8s)]
*  And if they do that, Sean, it really shouldn't be a very close election. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=308.68s)]
*  It will be close no matter what. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=311.68s)]
*  But this should give an edge, a substantial edge to Donald Trump, because she is so out [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=313.54s)]
*  of tune where America is, which is why she's trying to walk it back right now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=318.16s)]
*  Now, her best ally in walking it back is the mainstream media. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=322.64s)]
*  And you'll notice she has not answered any hard interviews. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=326.02s)]
*  She's not done any sessions with reporters, a news conference, a sit-down series of interviews. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  She even just walks up to the press, gives a one-sentence statement and walks away, and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=335.09999999999997s)]
*  the press just sits there going, OK, we'll take what you spoon feed us, because we're [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  the White House press corps. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=342.94s)]
*  Where are they banging on her to get access? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=348.94s)]
*  How does she get away with—and how does Joe Biden get away with the illegal immigrant [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=350.26s)]
*  question? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=356.14s)]
*  I mean, I can run another scroll. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=357.14s)]
*  That's the name of all the people that have been murdered by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=359.02s)]
*  illegal immigrants, even though they lied for three years and said the border is closed [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=363.58s)]
*  and the border is secure. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=367.3s)]
*  Joe? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=369.38s)]
*  Well, she has said that she wants to abolish ICE, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=370.38s)]
*  And again, we talked about she opposes remain-in-Mexico policy and border wall construction. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=374.78s)]
*  And basically eliminated the border, along with Joe Biden, when he first took office [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=380.38000000000005s)]
*  three and a half years ago. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=385.06s)]
*  The bottom line is, Sean, that the Democratic brand is still the brand. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  You could replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris, but inflation is still way too high for people's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=390.14000000000004s)]
*  tastes, right? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=395.22s)]
*  Something like the cost of living is up 25 percent since Joe Biden took office. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=396.22s)]
*  Gas prices are still 50 percent higher than when they were when Donald Trump left. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=400.86s)]
*  We still have 10 million people who entered the country illegally, including hundreds [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  on the FBI terror watch list. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=409.22s)]
*  The Ukraine-Russia war continues to be in perpetuity, in a stalemate, because the United [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=410.86s)]
*  States keeps funding that war. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=416.62s)]
*  And Democrats have taken all these positions that Americans, common sense, forget conservative [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=419.02000000000004s)]
*  or Democrat, just common sense people simply do not agree with. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=424.74s)]
*  So I don't think that she does, to Ari's point, get away with this eventually. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  She's going to have to answer questions eventually. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=434.06s)]
*  You can't do three months of fluff until we get to election day. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=436.34s)]
*  And when that debate happens between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, and I believe it [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=440.53999999999996s)]
*  will, I think that's where she gets exposed the same way Joe Biden was exposed on June [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=444.06s)]
*  27th in Atlanta, Sean. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=448.29999999999995s)]
*  Last question, exit question for Ari. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3KHZFxkvE&t=450.14s)]
