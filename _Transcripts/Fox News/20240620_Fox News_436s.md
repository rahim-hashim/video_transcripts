# Victor Davis Hanson: This is the most dangerous time in our lifetime
**Fox News:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg)
*  Biden's weakness on the world stage is allowing a new axis of evil to form right before your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=0.0s)]
*  eyes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=6.32s)]
*  Now, during his visit to North Korea, Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked Kim Jong-un [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=7.32s)]
*  for his support of the Ukraine invasion. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  In the two countries, they signed a mutual defense pact. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=15.96s)]
*  So, how's Joe responding to the emerging threat? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=19.0s)]
*  Well, he's leading from behind and turning his back on our strongest ally in the Middle [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  East. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=27.44s)]
*  Look at this new report. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=28.44s)]
*  The White House cancels a meeting. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=29.62s)]
*  They had a temper tantrum, a meeting scheduled for tomorrow with Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=31.82s)]
*  Netanyahu, because he posted a video saying the U.S. withholding military aid would be [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=37.58s)]
*  a disaster. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=44.38s)]
*  Tonight, the White House is pushing back on this claim. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=45.38s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=48.58s)]
*  Here with reaction, Hoover, institution, senior fellow, Victor Davis Hanson, Florida Congressman [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=49.58s)]
*  Michael Walz, Florida—Congressman from the great state of Florida. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  You know, I'm looking at this and I'm thinking, isn't it bad enough that we have a president [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=59.459999999999994s)]
*  of the United States that after the worst terror attack in Israel's history, where [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=64.22s)]
*  the equivalent of 40,000 Americans were murdered in a day, if you extrapolate out a population, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  and hundreds take in hostage, and you had murder, rape, beheadings, even of little children—and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=76.9s)]
*  I've seen the videos of that day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=84.74s)]
*  And America says, we're not going to help you, and by the way, we don't want you to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=89.30000000000001s)]
*  actually fight and win the war against the radical Islamic terrorists that attacked you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=94.62s)]
*  To me, that is the president of our country surrendering in the war on terrorism. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=105.94s)]
*  No, you're not wrong, Sean. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  And in this case, of course, I would prefer these disagreements on either side happen [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=111.5s)]
*  in private. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=117.62s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think Bibi finally said enough is enough. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=119.22s)]
*  You've got Chuck Schumer calling for regime change while Netanyahu is trying to lead his [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=123.14s)]
*  government in a war with hundreds of hostages being held. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=128.62s)]
*  You've got Biden and his allies in The New York Times demonizing Netanyahu personally. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=133.54s)]
*  You have them not objecting to the UN for the first time and abstaining with the anti-Israel [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=140.06s)]
*  measures there, and then tapping the brakes on arms that they badly need. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=148.9s)]
*  By the way, many of them are precision-guided, which is exactly what they need to prevent [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=154.34s)]
*  civilian casualties. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=159.06s)]
*  And oh, by the way, you've got the International Criminal Court threatening to arrest them [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=161.46s)]
*  for war crimes and genocide when it was exactly Hamas that committed them, not the democratically [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=166.66s)]
*  elected Israeli government. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  You have all of that happening. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=174.26s)]
*  And what do they cancel, Sean? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=176.74s)]
*  They cancel a meeting on Iran because we have new information that Iran could be weaponizing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=179.04s)]
*  the enriched uranium into a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=185.22s)]
*  So of all the things you're going to throw a temper tantrum on, it is what we're going [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  to do to stop Iran from having nukes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=192.26s)]
*  It is just asinine bad policy after bad policy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=194.54s)]
*  And meanwhile, you have what we hate in Florida, hurricanes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=199.38s)]
*  You have us going from a cat one to a cat five hurricane in terms of this axis of evil [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=205.14s)]
*  between China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=210.73999999999998s)]
*  And you've got a president that's just asleep at the switch. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=215.18s)]
*  This is only going to get worse from now until November. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=218.82s)]
*  November and Donald Trump can't come soon enough. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=222.14s)]
*  But I am deathly afraid of what happens between now and then. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=226.04s)]
*  You know, it really is amazing, Victor Davis Hansen, and maybe you can explain it to me. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=230.45999999999998s)]
*  You're far smarter than I am. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=236.34s)]
*  How is it that between being vice president and president, that Joe Biden only has a history [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=238.06s)]
*  of sucking up to the mullahs of Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=244.7s)]
*  They were partly responsible in the training and the arming of the terrorists on October [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  7th, helping Hamas. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=256.74s)]
*  They help Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=258.97999999999996s)]
*  They're helping the Houthi rebels out of Yemen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=261.58s)]
*  They are responsible for worldwide terrorism. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=265.06s)]
*  And he has turned a blind eye to sanctions. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=268.3s)]
*  He has given waivers that put tens of millions of dollars in the hands of the Iranian mullahs [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=271.02s)]
*  so they can continue their pursuit of nuclear weapons, which I believe is the real existential [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=276.82s)]
*  threat to the world, not global warming, as Joe Biden claims. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  If you can explain that to me, you're a far smarter guy than I could ever want or dream of being. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=287.9s)]
*  Well, Sean, it's a continuation of this bankrupt and scary policy of Ben Rhodes and the Obamas. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=294.7s)]
*  They cooked up this idea that they were going to empower an Iranian Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthi [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=301.42s)]
*  axis. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=309.82s)]
*  This was going to be the Persian-Shia counterbalance to Israel and the moderate Gulf regime. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=311.18s)]
*  They trashed Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=318.02s)]
*  They trashed Israel. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=319.18s)]
*  They built up this axis. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=320.18s)]
*  They called it creative tension. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=321.9s)]
*  We could vacate the Middle East and then play one side off against the other, completely [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=324.42s)]
*  oblivious that our friends in the Gulf were far better than the Iranians, of course, and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=328.9s)]
*  Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=334.53999999999996s)]
*  But this is the most dangerous time in our lifetime, Sean, all the way until Inauguration [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  Day, because Putin sees he's trying to get nuclear proxies in Iran and North Korea to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=341.82s)]
*  do what he thinks we're doing in Ukraine. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=348.38s)]
*  And Ukraine is not nuclear. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=350.97999999999996s)]
*  More importantly, he looks at Biden and he says either he's debilitated and he won't [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=352.82s)]
*  react or the Obamas are in control. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=356.74s)]
*  And I remember what they did in 2014 when I took the Donbas and the Crimea. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=359.5s)]
*  And I remember the hot mic and so whatever it is, it's an open window for me. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=364.26s)]
*  And then finally, Sean, it doesn't do any good to project this lack of deterrence after [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=369.66s)]
*  Kabul and the Chinese balloon and not doing anything to the Houthis. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=374.5s)]
*  And then to demonize, I mean, to call Putin constantly crazy SOB, thug, murderer, and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=378.46000000000004s)]
*  don't carry a twig and then shout out loud these insults. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  It's very dangerous what he's doing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=390.98s)]
*  And the military's short, 45,000 recruits. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=392.42s)]
*  He's cut the budget. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=395.38s)]
*  It's a perfect storm and we're in grave danger. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=396.38s)]
*  And you got a couple of axes of evil, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=400.22s)]
*  Now you have Russia and North Korea on top of Russia and China and Iran. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=403.1s)]
*  And then you have a president that's abdicated his role on the world stage as the leader [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=408.42s)]
*  of liberty and freedom worldwide. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=412.24s)]
*  And that void is more apparent than ever and more scary than it's ever been as well. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=415.24s)]
*  Frightening times. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=420.68s)]
*  Victor Davis Hansen, Congressman, thank you both. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ruRFABNlg&t=421.92s)]
