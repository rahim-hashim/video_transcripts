# Hannity: Democrats' latest move shows they don't care about democracy
**Fox News:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc)
*  Let's turn back, if we can, to the upside world of the Democratic Socialist Party, this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=0.0s)]
*  very strange relationship that they have with democracy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=4.84s)]
*  Now, it is a word that almost everyone on the left, they love to repeat over and over [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=7.88s)]
*  and over again. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=12.8s)]
*  They claim to cherish and revere democracy, both here, at home and around the world. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=13.98s)]
*  But, well, in reality, Democrats seem to love democracy in name only. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=19.36s)]
*  As Democratic professor, Jonathan Turley points out, they're now moving to bar Donald [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=25.08s)]
*  Trump and other Republican candidates from ballots all over the country. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=30.9s)]
*  In some cases, they're using activist judges who are unelected. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=35.2s)]
*  In Maine, you have a far-left, Biden-loving secretary of state unilaterally removing Donald [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Trump from the Republican primary ballot. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=44.0s)]
*  Well, so much for letting the voters decide. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=46.36s)]
*  Now, the longtime Democrat said it was, quote, her duty to block Republicans from voting [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=48.8s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=54.14s)]
*  Oh, one person decides. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=55.14s)]
*  And then in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Democrats now there, they're attempting to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=57.42s)]
*  remove Congressman Scott Perry from the ballot. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=61.96s)]
*  And according to Jonathan Turley, the guy that filed the challenge is a former congressional [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=64.86s)]
*  candidate who made headlines burning MAGA flags with swastikas outside of courthouses. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=69.5s)]
*  Great resume. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=75.7s)]
*  In every case, a common theme, the word insurrection. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  It's a phrase used by Democrats, Trump haters, over and over and over and over again, talking [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=80.5s)]
*  about January 6th. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=86.0s)]
*  They always forget the words peacefully, patriotically, march to the Capitol so your voices will be [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=87.3s)]
*  heard. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=92.1s)]
*  That always gets ignored. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=93.1s)]
*  Now they're using insurrection as an excuse to ban Donald Trump, other Republicans, from [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=94.86s)]
*  all future elections. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=100.62s)]
*  Now, none of these candidates, including former President Donald Trump, were ever convicted [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=102.1s)]
*  of insurrection. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=108.26s)]
*  As a matter of fact, they were never charged and up to now have never been charged with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=109.62s)]
*  insurrection. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  In other words, Democrats are trying to completely upend what is a real democratic process, one [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  they claim to revere solely on the basis of their own political smear. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  Now, this is what you would expect from the, what, Communist Party in the old Soviet Union, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  not really from people that claim to revere democracy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=130.62s)]
*  Now, of course, many Democrats don't actually care about democracy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=133.62s)]
*  They just want power in perpetuity. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=137.7s)]
*  One party, no checks, no balances and no dissent. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=140.33999999999997s)]
*  They believe deeply in their hearts that we, the American people, we simply cannot be trusted [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  and we should not have any say in deciding the vote. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  Take a look at the 2024 Democratic primary. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  Look at North Carolina. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=157.17999999999998s)]
*  With Biden's popularity at an all-time low, state officials there accepted a request from [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=158.6s)]
*  to actually remove every candidate from the primary ballot except for Joe Biden. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=164.9s)]
*  What a great system. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=170.06s)]
*  I applaud North Carolina. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=171.06s)]
*  It's just a little too risky to actually have voters have another option. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=172.86s)]
*  Does that seem like real democracy to you? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=177.26s)]
*  But this is just the beginning. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=180.1s)]
*  Ultimately, Democrats would like to expand the Supreme Court. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=181.5s)]
*  We know about that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=184.44s)]
*  They want to pack it with Democratic activists that would legislate from the bench. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=185.62s)]
*  They would love to grant statehood to Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=190.12s)]
*  They believe to secure four more Democratic U.S. senators. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=193.7s)]
*  And of course, they would absolutely love to grant amnesty to 8.5 million new reliable [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=197.5s)]
*  voters who they aided and abetted in lawbreaking. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=202.94s)]
*  And now they would grant the great gift of citizenship. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=206.78s)]
*  But of course, I'm sure they wouldn't expect votes in return for that great gift, would [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  they? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=214.62s)]
*  Not the people that dared to insist, you know, you come into the country legally, you're [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=215.62s)]
*  not going to vote for those people. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=219.7s)]
*  The people that said follow the law, respect our borders, respect our sovereignty, respect [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=221.5s)]
*  our laws. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=226.3s)]
*  This is all about power in perpetuity, not democracy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=227.52s)]
*  So when you have a Democrat on fake news CNN or MSDNC proclaiming their love for democracy, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=231.7s)]
*  just know they are nothing more than wolves in sheep's clothing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=238.38s)]
*  anywhere else. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-26NnXFFc&t=251.5s)]
