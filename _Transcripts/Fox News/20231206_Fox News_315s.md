# Trump: We would have been paying off debt!
**Fox News:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c)
*  Mr. President, Donald Trump, let me just throw out a list of some of the significant issues [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=0.0s)]
*  that we're facing as a country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=5.08s)]
*  And you've touched on a number of them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=6.8s)]
*  You mentioned borders, day one. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=8.84s)]
*  You mentioned energy, day one. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=10.88s)]
*  Look at where our economy is. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=13.64s)]
*  Last year, $2 trillion in debt, $34 trillion overall. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=15.0s)]
*  We this year, Mr. President, will pay, before we spend a dime, $1 trillion on debt service [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=20.18s)]
*  alone, before Medicare, Social Security, National Defense. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=28.32s)]
*  That is unsustainable. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=32.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=33.96s)]
*  So, before COVID hit us, our gift from China, that was our gift. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=34.96s)]
*  What happened to us with COVID, commonly known as the China virus. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=40.22s)]
*  They don't like that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=43.9s)]
*  But it was the China virus. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  We were doing energy, taking our liquid gold out of the ground at a rate that's never been [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=48.46s)]
*  seen before, and it was going up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=53.16s)]
*  We were going to be using that liquid gold to sell to Europe instead of the pipeline [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=55.56s)]
*  from Russia, which I exposed and I stopped. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=59.78s)]
*  You know, I stopped that line. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=62.52s)]
*  Then they say I was nice to Russia. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=64.2s)]
*  There was nobody that was nice. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  I was not nice to Russia. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=67.28s)]
*  I stopped that pipeline. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  We would have been selling oil and gas to Europe, to Asia, all over the world. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=70.12s)]
*  We would have been paying off debt. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=74.72s)]
*  That debt would be way down right now because we have more. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  What people don't know, we have more liquid gold than any other country in the world by [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=79.18s)]
*  far. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=83.18s)]
*  And we started off in fourth place. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=84.5s)]
*  We were number four with Saudi Arabia, with Russia. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=87.34s)]
*  It was two countries fighting for number three, and it was us at number four or five. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=89.9s)]
*  By the time I left, we were number one by 25 percent. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=94.5s)]
*  We would have been number one by 100. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=98.56s)]
*  And we would have done twice what they were going to do combined. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  We would have been paying off debt. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=104.06s)]
*  We would have been reducing taxes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=105.98s)]
*  We gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, bigger than the Reagan tax [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=107.9s)]
*  cut. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  We've been reducing taxes to further. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=112.82s)]
*  And that's why, Sean, that's why we had the most jobs of any president ever, because we [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=114.82s)]
*  gave the — we got rid of regulations — tremendous. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=119.94s)]
*  No president got rid of — more regulations were closed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=123.08s)]
*  And we gave you the big tax cut. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=126.02s)]
*  So everybody had incentive, and everybody was happy, and everybody was working. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=127.33999999999999s)]
*  I remember groups came to see me that wouldn't normally like me, and they said, we've never [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=132.1s)]
*  seen anything like it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  We were actually starting to get along, but we got hit with the China virus. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=137.7s)]
*  Some people think purposely — I don't. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=141.54s)]
*  I think it was incompetence. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=143.17999999999998s)]
*  But some people think purposely, because we were doing so much better than any other country [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=144.62s)]
*  ever, and we got hit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=149.82s)]
*  But I will tell you, we would be paying that debt off right now at levels like never seen [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=152.54s)]
*  before, and it would have been a beautiful thing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=156.66s)]
*  You brought us to energy independence for the first time in 75 years. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=158.89999999999998s)]
*  Before you ran, I remember we had many discussions about energy independence, energy independence, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=162.54s)]
*  and you're saying that you would — in a second term, you will push America to be the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=168.66s)]
*  most energy-dominant country on Earth, and that you could pay down that $34 trillion [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=174.94s)]
*  in debt, and we won't have a trillion-dollar interest payment every year. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=181.74s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=185.7s)]
*  We would get it way down. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=186.7s)]
*  And, you know — look, so it's Biden inflation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=187.7s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=194.14s)]
*  What he did with energy is unbelievable, because energy went up so much — gasoline, $5, $6 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=195.38s)]
*  a gallon — that that's what caused inflation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  Now it's all over the place. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=203.66s)]
*  But you have 29 percent total inflation. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=205.1s)]
*  Now when it hauls up — because the economy is starting to slow down very substantially [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=208.94s)]
*  — so when it hauls up, he's saying, well, we don't have too much inflation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=213.26s)]
*  But he doesn't talk about all of the inflation that you've had to suffer over the last three [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=216.9s)]
*  years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  No, we will have numbers like you've never seen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  We have a thing in Alaska called ANWR. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=225.32s)]
*  Ronald Reagan tried to get it approved. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=228.0s)]
*  Everybody should push maybe a little bit. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, he didn't work his heart. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=232.2s)]
*  But we have ANWR in Alaska — the biggest anywhere in the world, including probably [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=233.88s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  I got it approved. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=241.76s)]
*  I was so proud of it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=242.76s)]
*  They ended it in the first week. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=244.34s)]
*  They ended it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=246.28s)]
*  They turned — we'll get it back. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=247.28s)]
*  But we have more than anybody. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=248.64s)]
*  We have more wealth than anybody. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  But we don't use it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=252.18s)]
*  And then guys like DeSantis and guys like — many of the Democrats, but guys like DeSantis [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=253.18s)]
*  and, to a lesser extent, Nikki Haley, they want to play around with your Social Security. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=258.1s)]
*  You don't have to touch Social Security. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  We have money laying in the ground far greater than anything we can do by hurting senior [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=265.54s)]
*  citizens with their Social Security. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=271.66s)]
*  Ron DeSantis wanted to bring up on Social Security — now, of course, he says, well, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=275.14s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=279.78000000000003s)]
*  One thing I learned about politicians — I've known them, I've dealt with them on the other [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  side for a long time — their first thought is always the thought that they go to. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=283.96s)]
*  He wanted to raise the minimum age — the age on Social Security — to 70. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=288.14s)]
*  That's a big increase. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=292.9s)]
*  But he also wanted to raise it to 75. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=294.14s)]
*  If that happened, people would be devastated. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=297.09999999999997s)]
*  We have such incredible wealth under our feet. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFfM61kK6c&t=310.78s)]
