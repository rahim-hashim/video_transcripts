# Donald Trump: Kamala Harris has no idea what she is doing and will cause a depression
**Fox News:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ)
*  Fighting inflation is one of our administration's top economic priorities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Was it wrong to consider inflation transitory? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=6.2s)]
*  I mean, these price spikes seem like they're going to be with us for a while. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  We have to address the fact that we got to deal with the fact that folks are paying for [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=12.84s)]
*  gas, paying for groceries, and are, are, are, need solutions to it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=18.52s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=23.72s)]
*  adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=29.0s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=33.28s)]
*  And it's rough. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=35.08s)]
*  Groceries, the cost of groceries has gone up, the cost of gas has gone up. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=36.08s)]
*  And as this is all happening in the context of two years of a pandemic, it's one of the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=41.0s)]
*  highest priorities actually for the president and for me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=46.2s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=49.56s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=52.56s)]
*  And we are very proud of Bidenomics. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=57.64s)]
*  We continue our, she's very proud of Bidenomics. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=60.64s)]
*  In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that was Kamala Harris touting her pretty radical beliefs [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=64.64s)]
*  on the economy in her own words, according to Kamala, her values have not changed. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=70.16s)]
*  We don't know where she stands because she's only done an interview for 16 minutes and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  29 seconds spoken. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=80.48s)]
*  So on the issue of the economy, just how many of you in this room, and you can all close [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=83.24s)]
*  your eyes so you're not looking at your neighbor, have struggled economically in the last number [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  of years? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  And when I started my adult life, I struggled to pay my rent. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  You know my jobs, I've listed them a hundred times, working in the service industry and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  bartending and cooking and washing dishes and construction. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=111.48s)]
*  Not McDonald's, that was a lie. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  By the way, she didn't work at McDonald's, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  She did not, well, there's no evidence of it so far. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=123.48s)]
*  Did she work at McDonald's? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=126.68s)]
*  So far no evidence. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't think so, based on what I see. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  She wants to raise corporate taxes, she wants to raise small business taxes, capital gain [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=132.96s)]
*  taxes, estate taxes, the international corporate minimum tax to the point where America won't [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=138.28s)]
*  be competitive anymore. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=145.72s)]
*  And your tax cuts are about to expire in 2025. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=147.0s)]
*  What does this mean for the economy? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=151.0s)]
*  What does it mean for everybody here struggling? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=152.0s)]
*  So I gave you the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  If you let them, if you let the Trump tax cuts expire, which she wants to do, she wants [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=158.04s)]
*  to terminate them, if you do that, you will suffer the biggest tax increase in history. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=168.0s)]
*  There's never been a tax increase like it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  On top of which, she wants to add a lot of tax. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=176.48s)]
*  This country will end up, and I've said this a lot, and I mean it, this country will end [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=179.89999999999998s)]
*  in a depression if she becomes president, like 1929. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  This will be a 1929 depression. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  She has no idea what the hell she's doing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=193.12s)]
*  What if unrealized capital gains taxes were implemented? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=195.36s)]
*  What would that do? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, she wants to do that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  This is where you have something, you don't even know what the value is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  I tell you what, if that's going to happen, go out and open an appraisal company, because [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  you're going to make a fortune. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  That's about the only group that's going to make it, and accountants. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  It is the craziest idea. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=213.56s)]
*  And remember this, very rich people and big international corporations, they don't have [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=215.36s)]
*  to stay in the United States. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=220.52s)]
*  And they will be forced to leave for other countries. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=222.8s)]
*  They can't afford to do a thing like that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=226.16s)]
*  They may have great wealth and no cash, and they're going to have to pay cash. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=228.32s)]
*  Where are they going to get the cash? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  If they do that, the unrealized capital gain, it's, you know, it's been talked about for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=234.68s)]
*  a few years by ultra left Marxists only, like her father's a Marxist. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=241.36s)]
*  Her father's a Marxist teacher of economics. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=247.36s)]
*  Can you believe this? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=250.88s)]
*  But if that happened, this country, and I think forgetting about that, that particular, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=252.2s)]
*  she's got a lot of things that are just as bad. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=257.68s)]
*  If she gets in, I think we will have a depression, 1929 style depression. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=260.68s)]
*  That's what I think will happen to our country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=266.72s)]
*  Already, they've set us on a path. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=268.72s)]
*  What about price gauging, as she calls it, or gouging? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=270.64s)]
*  Well, she called it gauging. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=273.96s)]
*  And what if they implement that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  And then price controls? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=278.12s)]
*  That's been tried in many times. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=280.52s)]
*  The former Soviet Union, Venezuela, even in this country in the 70s, it was a disaster. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=282.68s)]
*  Every time it's been tried, no matter, over hundreds of years, not just over hundreds [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=287.96s)]
*  of years, price controls, you end up with no product. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  You end up with massive inflation, and you end up with the destruction of a country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=296.24s)]
*  And how does this impact, how do high interest rates impact? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=300.68s)]
*  How does inflation impact everybody that's here? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=303.76s)]
*  Well, they can't buy a home. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  They can't do anything. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=306.92s)]
*  Your business is stopped up. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  You can't borrow money. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  By the way, I had interest rates at 2%. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=311.6s)]
*  Now they're 10%, but you can't get the money. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=314.68s)]
*  You can't get the money. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=316.68s)]
*  There's no money available. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=318.68s)]
*  So 10% is right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=320.36s)]
*  You know, if you can't get the money, 10% is not the right number. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=322.36s)]
*  It's got to be much more than that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=325.48s)]
*  You can't borrow money to buy a house now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fWiwuh-nQ&t=327.0s)]
