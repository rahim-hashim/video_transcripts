# Victor Davis Hanson: This is deliberate
**Fox News:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A)
*  And tonight, more stunning examples of illegal immigrant crime in Joe Biden's America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=0.0s)]
*  An illegal immigrant was just arrested for murder in Ohio. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=5.36s)]
*  Turns out the guy had been deported a whopping seven different times. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=10.56s)]
*  Local sheriff says the illegal claims he's able to get back into the country [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  within two weeks of being deported. That is how easy it is for criminals [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=19.68s)]
*  get into our country under Biden. How many of those people might be terrorists [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=24.48s)]
*  and they are building terror cells in our country? For example, in New York City, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=30.64s)]
*  six of the eight illegal immigrants, remember the ones arrested this week on guns and weapons [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=35.36s)]
*  charges, the ones that were squatting in the basement of a Bronx apartment? Yeah, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=41.36s)]
*  they were released in accordance with New York's Nobel law. Nobel set free gun and drug [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=46.72s)]
*  charges among them. As you can see on your screen earlier today, while Fox cameras were rolling, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=54.72s)]
*  DHS agents, they showed up and arrested three of them. Seven of the eight are now currently in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  custody. Some are in local jail, some in federal, and that's not all. Probably the rest went to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=65.68s)]
*  California, the sanctuary state. According to the New York Post, the illegal who was teaching other [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=70.56s)]
*  illegals, remember this guy was on social media, is now himself allegedly facing federal firearm [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=76.64s)]
*  charges. When asked today why criminal illegals are being shown the revolving door back to freedom, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=83.84s)]
*  why it's so easy to cross over the southern border, well, there was Karine Jean-Pierre. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=93.12s)]
*  She didn't have much of an answer. What a shock. Take a look. There's this story in New York, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  an eight-person crew of border crossers found with drugs and guns. Six of them now are out on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  bail. Does President Biden think policies like that are making the country safer? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=109.68s)]
*  So I want to be really careful. That's an active case, so don't want to comment on an active case, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  but anyone found guilty, and we've been very clear about that, anyone found guilty of a crime [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  should be held accountable. We have been very, very clear about that. And if a person poses [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  danger to a community, they should be detained pre-trial. Remember, she spread the lie, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  the big lie. Oh, the border's secure, the border's closed, just like Vice President [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=138.72s)]
*  Harris, your borders are, just like Joe himself, just like Circleback Jen Psaki, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=144.16s)]
*  just like Alejandro Mayorkas. Here with the reaction. He is a senior fellow at the Hoover [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=148.8s)]
*  Institution. Our friend, Victor Davis Hansen. Okay, the numbers speak for itself. The reality is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=154.16s)]
*  they don't care, because if they cared Victor Davis Hansen, they would look at the tens and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=161.2s)]
*  thousands of illegals from China showing up at our southern border, and they would see a national [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=168.72s)]
*  security threat. They would say the same thing about people coming from Russia and people coming [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  from Egypt and Afghanistan. Oh, and the number one state sponsor of terror, Iran and their [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=178.96s)]
*  satellite state of Syria. But they don't care, do they? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=184.88s)]
*  I think it's worse than that, Sean. I think they deliberately want them to come. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  If you have 10 million people and just 1% are criminally minded or intended, that's 100,000 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=195.36s)]
*  people, and they know that. And I think they see that as collateral damage, and it's acceptable [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=201.68s)]
*  damage because the greater project, as Ted Cruz pointed out, they want underâ€”when you have a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=207.52s)]
*  system that goes from 30% voting absentee in 2020 to 70%, and the rejection rate goes down by a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=212.56s)]
*  magnitude, and people are going to be mailed these ballots, and if anybody objects, they have this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=221.76s)]
*  paradigm that you're an election denialist or voter suppressionist or a racist, they feel they [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  have a formula that is going to be very valuable in 2024. As far as letting people out on bail, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  that's even more pernicious without no bail at all. I think when you look at critical legal theory [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=238.0s)]
*  and you see these violent criminals that are almost released instantaneously, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=244.72s)]
*  what's the ideology behind it? I think it's more, we're not going to let you middle-class people be [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=249.36s)]
*  complacent in your little plastic lives and think you can go on in your bubble while the other is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=254.88s)]
*  hurting. So we're going to let these people out, and they're going to confront you with these social [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=261.2s)]
*  problems and these cries of social justice, and you're going to have to address it. You're going [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=265.6s)]
*  to have to pay higher taxes. You're going to have to more DEI. You're going to have to more programs. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=269.92s)]
*  That's deliberate, too. I think it's a nihilist deliberation, but my God, it's not waxabee. It's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=274.8s)]
*  not incidental. It's premeditated. It defines all common sense, which is not so common, and all [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=282.32s)]
*  logic that we would have. That is that what I would want at our border is very simple, not complicated. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=290.56s)]
*  I think it's common sense. Anybody coming into this country has to do so legally. They need to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=298.4s)]
*  be vetted so they don't have radical associations. After COVID, I would say everybody needs a health [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=304.0s)]
*  check, and we have to means-test people so that they don't become a financial burden on the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=310.8s)]
*  American people when they get here. I don't think that's unreasonable, because there's no shortage [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=317.04s)]
*  of people that would want to come that we can trust would be vetted and would not be wanting to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=322.56s)]
*  bring harm or have nefarious intentions against the people of our great country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=329.2s)]
*  I don't think they want those people. I think they look at the Hungarian Revolution when we had [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=337.36s)]
*  immigrants come in that fit exactly what you're talking about. They look at the people who [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=341.76s)]
*  originally fled Castro in the 60s, and they say these people came in many cases with high school [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=346.4s)]
*  diplomas, college degrees, skills. They assimilated. They integrated. They were not a useful constituency [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=352.0s)]
*  very long, and they don't want those people. We could let in half a million people if we vetted [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=358.64s)]
*  them, as you pointed out. We could bring in engineers and doctors. They all want to come, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=363.36s)]
*  but the left doesn't want those people because they don't serve as a useful constituency for [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=367.76s)]
*  a larger government expansion and a complete revolution in the way we vote for our elected [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=373.2s)]
*  officials. This is deliberate. Mallorcas knows that, and so does Biden and the people controlling [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=379.2s)]
*  Biden. That's why it's so toxic. It's so nihilistic, as you point out. They have blood on their hands. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=385.28s)]
*  Every illegal immigrant that kills an American, every American that is raped, and if I am right, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=392.55999999999995s)]
*  I pray that I'm wrong. I don't think I am, and there are terror cells, and they attack this country, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  and another 9-11 or worse happens, they will have all of that blood on their hands. I want every [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=405.67999999999995s)]
*  American to understand that, that people from our top geopolitical foes are allowed in because of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=411.68s)]
*  Joe's open borders, and they don't seem to give an Adam Schiff at all. Professor, thank you. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=418.88s)]
*  I hope we're both wrong. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZs5fyW5A&t=427.36s)]
