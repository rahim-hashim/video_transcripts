# Sean Hannity: Kamala without a teleprompter is ‘scary’
**Fox News:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM)
*  This is all taking place as Kamala and her friends and the state-run media mob are touting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=0.0s)]
*  Kamala's so-called politics of joy. Okay, in reality, nothing really joyful about today's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=5.44s)]
*  Democratic Party. The base, well, that is comprised of virulent anti-Semites that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=11.68s)]
*  don't love our country, despise capitalism, hate Israel, and at the top, a nominee didn't win a [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=16.72s)]
*  single primary vote, not one. Kamala Harris is the only Democratic nominee because, well, the party [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=23.52s)]
*  elites, frankly, humiliated Joe Biden, disenfranchised his voters, forced him to end his campaign. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=30.16s)]
*  The truth is, there's nothing real or authentic about this convention going on right behind me [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=36.56s)]
*  or the Harris Wall's campaign. Even a simple trip to a gas station is seemingly scripted, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=43.28s)]
*  in case you haven't noticed, the Harris campaign is trying to highlight Kamala eating Doritos [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=48.96s)]
*  in order to connect with normal folks like us. Take a look. Oh, Dougie, there they are. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=55.36s)]
*  I know you want this. What do you get? For future. Can I go get it? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=64.8s)]
*  I do, and these are just as my go-to, the original nacho cheese. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=72.56s)]
*  Do you think corn nuts over there, Tim? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=79.44s)]
*  Now, maybe she'll need another really super, you know, size big bag if Donald Trump wins like [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=88.0s)]
*  she did in 2016. Oh, but she eats Doritos, like all of us, but unlike the rest of us, Kamala had [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=92.96s)]
*  the gas station completely cleared of any and all customers, the people, you know, the little people, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=99.84s)]
*  as they say, us, we the people before she arrived, possibly to avoid any awkward human interaction. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=106.64s)]
*  Now, we saw the same thing at a Pittsburgh diner. You're going to love this. Customers, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=114.24s)]
*  they were forced to leave the restaurant before Kamala Harris and Tim Walls arrived [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=118.64s)]
*  so the campaign could bring in their own audience. Why talk to regular people? Apparently, Kamala is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=123.84s)]
*  so terrible at talking to people that the campaign is now forced to go to extraordinary lengths never [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=130.0s)]
*  seen before to shield her from everyday people so she doesn't have to answer a real question or [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=135.84s)]
*  talk to a member of the press or actually do an interview and she somehow still managed to produce [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=142.0s)]
*  one of her famous or infamous word salads and take a look. Our election is about understanding [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=146.96s)]
*  the importance of this beautiful country of ours in terms of what we stand for around the globe as [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=155.76s)]
*  a democracy. As a democracy, we know there's a duality to the nature of democracy. On the one hand, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=161.36s)]
*  incredible strength when it is intact. What it does for its people to protect and defend their [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=172.4s)]
*  rights, their liberty, and their freedom. Incredibly strong and incredibly fragile. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=182.72s)]
*  All right, Kamala, without a teleprompter is a pretty scary sight for Democratic Party elites [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=192.72s)]
*  and it's, you know, not just the word salads. It's Kamala's radical beliefs that we have been [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=198.4s)]
*  showing you night after night after night. They are too far, you know, for most Americans and her [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=203.92s)]
*  campaign knows it, which is why they are trying desperately to get her to flip and to flop and to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=211.04s)]
*  flail and to change every stated position she's pretty much ever had because top Democrats know [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  that if America understands who she is against fracking, against drilling, defund, dismantle, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  no bail laws, Kamala Harris, you know, let's decriminalize the borders, let's give free health [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  care and housing and education to illegal immigrants. If in fact they know her position [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=236.0s)]
*  on the issues of the economy, Bidenomics is doing great, she said recently, but I'm going to deal [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=241.68s)]
*  with inflation on day one. Well, I thought inflation was transitory. I thought the border was secure. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=246.96s)]
*  Why haven't you been to the border? Well, I haven't been to Europe either. They know if people, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=252.72s)]
*  the American people know her real opinion, she will lose in a landslide if her beliefs are known. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=259.36s)]
*  That's why, by the way, her website is scrubbed of all policy positions, but don't worry, let not [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=265.44s)]
*  your heart be troubled on Hannity.com. I have Kamala and Tim Walz in their own words. Now, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=270.8s)]
*  the one original proposal that she announced, socialist price controls on groceries, she's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=276.64s)]
*  against price gauging. It's getting trashed on both sides of the aisle, very harsh rebukes in both [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=282.56s)]
*  the New York Times and the Washington Post, but don't expect to hear any real policy discussions [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=288.8s)]
*  this week because this convention, you know, Kamala Harris, it is scripted to the T and they [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=293.84s)]
*  went to great lengths to rehearse even a stop at a gas station and replace real people eating at a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=300.56s)]
*  diner, at a restaurant. They have to go, let's bring in the people that are actors even or [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  supporters. So you better believe the convention is going to be the most scripted, the most phony [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=314.0s)]
*  in DNC and human history and Kamala the con artist. Well, the phoniest campaign we've ever [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=319.92s)]
*  seen, smoke mirrors, lies, deception, manipulation, and frankly all of that is corrupt. Now, any moment, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=326.24s)]
*  by the way, we expect Kamala Harris is going to take to the stage right behind me and as a matter [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  of fact, they are doing the introduction. She's only expected to speak for about two and a half [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=339.44s)]
*  minutes. We'll carry that whopping two and a half minutes straight from the teleprompter to your [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=345.2s)]
*  bedroom, living room, study, wherever you happen to be. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnWkAsYKjM&t=351.12s)]
