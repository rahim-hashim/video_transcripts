# Sen. Kennedy: This is grotesque
**Fox News:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs)
*  All right, so what impact does the political show trial in New York have on America's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=0.0s)]
*  judicial system? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=5.08s)]
*  Let's step back a little bit here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=6.08s)]
*  And here to respond to that is Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=7.28s)]
*  Senator, you've been a busy man, but sometimes when we're in the middle of something we [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=11.36s)]
*  know is a show trial or we know is playing to the electorate, it's meant to have a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=15.36s)]
*  political effect, we're maybe missing the implications of this moment. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=19.72s)]
*  How significant is this weaponization in the history of our judicial system, and what course [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=24.32s)]
*  is this setting us on? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=29.479999999999997s)]
*  In my opinion, Pete, President Biden and the district attorney have run over America's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=33.28s)]
*  political or rather criminal justice system, backed up and run over it again. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=40.8s)]
*  As one commentator put it, how can something so small, allegedly falsifying business [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=48.68s)]
*  records six years ago, result in something so big for the first time in America's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=56.44s)]
*  history, the criminal prosecution of a former president of the United States? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=65.84s)]
*  And I've concluded, I think most Americans have, that the answer is just craven, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=72.8s)]
*  grotesque politics. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=79.32s)]
*  No, no, no person in the Milky Way believes that these charges, falsifying business records, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=82.16s)]
*  would have been brought against anyone on God's green earth except Donald Trump. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=90.56s)]
*  President Biden and D.A. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=98.96s)]
*  Bragg have made a conscious decision to bastardize America's criminal justice system [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  and to prosecute President Biden's political opponent. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=108.56s)]
*  I don't believe President Trump would be being prosecuted, but for the fact he is running [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=114.48s)]
*  against President Biden. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=119.28s)]
*  And as I've said before, this is the sort of thing that happens in countries whose [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=120.84s)]
*  Powerball jackpot is 287 chickens and a goat. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=126.56s)]
*  This is not supposed to happen in America. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=131.28s)]
*  Now that they have done it, though, they may be the first, but they won't be the last. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=134.32000000000002s)]
*  They have summoned spirits they can't control. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=141.12s)]
*  There are thousands of ambitious prosecutors out there across America, Democrats and Republicans, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  and their constituents now are going to expect them to prosecute political opponents. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  President Biden, for his own politics, has placed the American criminal justice system [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=158.96s)]
*  ass deep in insanity. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=164.16s)]
*  And he and Mr. Bragg ought to hide their head in a bag. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=167.44s)]
*  It's grotesque, in my opinion. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=172.64s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=175.2s)]
*  Senator, they've started it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=176.72s)]
*  The question is, the next step, is there a possibility, and Trump has alluded to this, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=178.56s)]
*  that you could actually course correct this judicial system at the end of the day? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=184.0s)]
*  At the federal and state level? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=188.56s)]
*  Or have we just entered a fight fire with fire phase, where, hey, you did it, now we're [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=190.08s)]
*  going to do it even stronger because we control the judiciary? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=195.6s)]
*  Or is the deep state going to steer that in your mind? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=199.52s)]
*  Where does it go next? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  Where should it go? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=204.32s)]
*  Well, President Biden and District Attorney Bragg have taken the unthinkable [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=205.12s)]
*  and turned it into the tolerable. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=213.12s)]
*  And I fear that it will eventually become the normal. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=215.84s)]
*  And the attitude of many people will be, two wrongs don't make it right, but they do make [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=221.44s)]
*  it even. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=228.96s)]
*  And that is dangerous for America's political system and our criminal justice system. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=230.88s)]
*  This is just unconscionable. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=239.2s)]
*  Well, President Biden, I was hoping he would govern with knowledge and wisdom. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  He has governed with appetite and ambition. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=248.96s)]
*  And his term has just been one long prayer. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=254.08s)]
*  The only way, I'll just say this, Pete, the only way we're going to find justice in America [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=261.44s)]
*  is in a voting booth. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=268.0s)]
*  Amen to that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=271.84s)]
*  I think the largest jury of all the American people are going to have to put this back on course. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=272.56s)]
*  You're right, it doesn't make it right, but it does make it even. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=277.2s)]
*  And I know a lot of people who certainly feel that way. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  Senator Kennedy, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MxdMmOqTOs&t=283.28s)]
