# This is the most audacious influence-peddling racket in US history, Gregg Jarrett says
**Fox News:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8)
*  Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, along with Federalist correspondent Brianna Lyman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=0.0s)]
*  Greg, you know, you've literally written the book on the nature of the corruption of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=4.84s)]
*  the government, the attacks on President Trump, the nature of what it's willing to do. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=9.6s)]
*  And here nowâ€”and it's kind of eking out, and now we can kind of put the pieces together [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  of a puzzle that we knew mattered. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=20.64s)]
*  How significant is this? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=23.44s)]
*  When we think about this back and forth, it appears like there was a back and forth between [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=25.12s)]
*  Biden and China. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=30.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=32.32s)]
*  You know, whenever Joe Biden does something highly beneficial to the Chinese, these commutations [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=33.32s)]
*  clearly were that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=41.06s)]
*  His motivations are suspect. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=42.88s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden is compromised by his own suspected involvement in his son's China [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=44.64s)]
*  that netted some $5 million to the Biden family. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=51.24s)]
*  Congress found the receipts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=56.04s)]
*  They found the wire transfers, the bank accounts, not to mention all the shell companies that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=57.2s)]
*  were used. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=61.68s)]
*  Is it any wonder that the father gifted his son this unprecedented blanket pardon for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=62.68s)]
*  everything he did for 11 years? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=69.28s)]
*  Total immunity for things like money laundering, foreign lobbying crimes, violation of the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=71.76s)]
*  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, bribery, conspiracy, the list goes on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=77.6s)]
*  And the paper trail, Tammy, tells the story of what I think is the most audacious influence [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=82.91999999999999s)]
*  peddling racket ever in American history, the magnitude of which we've never seen before [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  in the sheer dollar numbers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=96.0s)]
*  And the evidence is compelling that Joe Biden played a pivotal role. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=98.6s)]
*  I called him in my columns the closer. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=102.84s)]
*  He made the deals happen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=106.84s)]
*  So commuting sentences for the Chinese, that fits the self-dealing pattern of Joe Biden. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=109.0s)]
*  No, Brianna, this is one of the issues, of course. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  We ultimately find out the truth. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=121.16s)]
*  But the presidency and the American government relies on legitimacy, on the believability [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=123.76s)]
*  and the trust that we put in it to not betray us, that we're not their commode, that this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=130.58s)]
*  is a much bigger issue. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=136.44s)]
*  Do you think that that kind of eats away at the nature of whether or not the American [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=139.04s)]
*  people take our government seriously beyond Joe Biden? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=144.52s)]
*  Because it should matter. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=148.56s)]
*  We need to be able to trust our president. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=149.68s)]
*  Perhaps that's part of the statement that this last election made. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=152.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=156.6s)]
*  And we're talking about China, so it's only fair we mention the recent report from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=157.6s)]
*  NBC about the Chinese spy balloon. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=162.36s)]
*  And while it's great that we talk about the details of the updates to that story, what [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=165.32s)]
*  it really does is it underscores just how untrustworthy the Biden-Harris administration [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=169.32s)]
*  and the intelligence community has been. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=173.68s)]
*  Because remember, they spent weeks telling us that this was a weather balloon, that there [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=176.4s)]
*  was nothing to be concerned about, because they were trying to gaslight the American [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=180.4s)]
*  people and conceal the fact that they allowed our foreign adversary to fly a spy balloon [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=183.68s)]
*  over the country for days with no repercussions. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=189.48s)]
*  And then they tried to conceal it from Congress and the American people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=192.16s)]
*  So these types of stories should really underscore why people shouldn't not only trust the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=195.28s)]
*  intelligence communities, but the Biden-Harris administration, especially with the backdrop [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=199.24s)]
*  of all these drone stories, you know? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  If they're willing to lie to us about all these other things, what else are they going to do? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=204.72s)]
*  You know, they never thought, you guys, that we would be back in charge, that the regulars, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=208.84s)]
*  the normals, would be back in charge. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=212.96s)]
*  They just thought they would get away with this, because they saw that spy balloon, we [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=214.96s)]
*  know, when it launched out of China, I believe, and they watched it come around to the islands [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=218.68s)]
*  and across to Alaska, and they knew, they knew it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=224.84s)]
*  And then they let it traverse the entire country. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, Greg, when we think about the corruption in this regard, and I mentioned that to Stephen [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  Miller in the previous segment, is that it's not just Joe Biden. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  As you've talked about, it's the swamp. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=243.12s)]
*  It's this entire dynamic. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  Do you think, with the agenda that we've heard, spoken about by Donald Trump and the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=246.68s)]
*  things he's pledged, is it possible to really, and with Doge and all of this, is there a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=251.6s)]
*  way to really bite into this pit of corruption that we're dealing with? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=257.04s)]
*  Well, even if you expose, let's say, half of it, it's going to be earth-shattering, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=262.6s)]
*  shocking, breathtaking to the American public. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=268.4s)]
*  And we need to get to the bottom of the balloon scandal. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=273.0s)]
*  I mean, it underscores, doesn't it, Tammy, the utter contempt that the Chinese, the Chinese [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  have for our weak president? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=281.52s)]
*  Or is it the hold that they have over Joe Biden because of his son's influence peddling [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  racket? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, take your pick, but one thing's for sure, Biden never tried to punish China or [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  hold its government accountable for such aggressive spycraft. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  The White House claims, oh, don't worry about it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=301.56s)]
*  We were able to protect sensitive sites on the ground, and we stopped any signals, intelligent [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=304.08s)]
*  collection by the Chinese. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you believe it? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=312.32s)]
*  I don't for a minute. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=313.16s)]
*  It sounds like a classic Joe Biden cover up. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  But why did it happen in the first place? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=318.24s)]
*  Trump would never have tolerated such an intrusion. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=320.92s)]
*  And I hope when he gets into office again, he declassifies the whole humiliating episode. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=325.92s)]
*  It'll be more exposure of the deep state and their cover up. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=333.24s)]
*  That's a great idea. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  Brianna, give you the last word here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=338.2s)]
*  That is a good idea in the sense that the president has already talked about wanting [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=340.44s)]
*  to open up files regarding the John F. Kennedy assassination, the Robert F. Kennedy assassination. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=344.36s)]
*  I would put in there Martin Luther King Jr. assassination. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=350.0s)]
*  That would be important as well. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=354.4s)]
*  His own, this attempts against him. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=356.44s)]
*  But also these very bizarre events like the Chinese spy balloon. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=359.0s)]
*  What occurred? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=364.32s)]
*  What was the intelligence community doing? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=365.32s)]
*  Do you think that would be valuable? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=368.88s)]
*  Donald Trump can give the Biden administration a master class in what being the administration [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=371.88s)]
*  of truth and transparency actually means. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=376.16s)]
*  And it starts with declassifying all of these documents and more, and also giving more, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=378.56s)]
*  or having more accountability in the White House. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=382.72s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden, it wasn't just that China had contempt for him. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden had contempt for the American people because he didn't mind gaslighting us and [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=388.0s)]
*  lying to our face to try and conceal a massive scandal. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=391.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, this all goes down to it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  Greg, you mentioned it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  This is about betrayal. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=400.8s)]
*  It's about the nature of what, if that's the guy that they put as president, the Democratic [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=401.8s)]
*  Party, and then Kamala, this is really the attitude, I think, of the entire Democratic [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  Party. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=412.16s)]
*  And this has got to be exposed completely for what it is. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=413.16s)]
*  Greg, Brianna, great job. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jCRI1m_z8&t=416.8s)]
