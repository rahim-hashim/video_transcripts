# Sen. Katie Britt: Biden's polices have failed Americans
**Fox News:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc)
*  South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Alabama, Senator Katie Britt. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=0.0s)]
*  Great to see you both. How are you? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=4.2s)]
*  I'm great. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=6.2s)]
*  Okay. I saw you speak last night. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=7.0s)]
*  Now you guys are friends. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=9.8s)]
*  Yeah. We've always been friends. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=10.8s)]
*  Yep. Yep. I actually got to go help her get elected too. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=12.6s)]
*  Let's get your reaction first. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=15.4s)]
*  Okay. South Dakota. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=17.8s)]
*  It's a free state. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  It's a free state. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=20.3s)]
*  Okay. You believe in the Second Amendment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=20.8s)]
*  Under God, the people rule. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=22.3s)]
*  Okay. You know 130 yards is nothing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=23.7s)]
*  It's nothing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=27.1s)]
*  Not secure. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=28.0s)]
*  I could spend 10, 15 minutes with one of my kids and it'd be an easy shot. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=28.6s)]
*  Easy shot. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=33.4s)]
*  Yep. Easy shot. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=34.2s)]
*  And that you heard the head of the Secret Service and I'm not leaving and oh by the way it was a slope roof so we put the agents inside. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=35.2s)]
*  You know Sean, leadership has consequences and it always, the buck always stops with the leader. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=44.1s)]
*  So she needs to be fired. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=49.1s)]
*  She needs to be gone. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=50.2s)]
*  There is a clear failure here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=51.6s)]
*  We'll get into the details and we'll gather more information all along. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=53.2s)]
*  But right away we need to understand in this country that there's consequences for making poor decisions and for putting people in jeopardy the way that this administration does. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=56.5s)]
*  Yeah. Senator, great to have you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=63.8s)]
*  You know, I did call Alabama home for a couple of years. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=67.2s)]
*  We're so proud that you did. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=70.1s)]
*  A lot of people, when I left Alabama, the local newspaper said goodbye to the talk show hosts from hell. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=71.6s)]
*  When I left Atlanta, it said AJC. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=77.6s)]
*  1996 was a great year. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=80.7s)]
*  The Olympics came and Hannity left. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=82.4s)]
*  So I'm not so sure if everybody would share your view. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=84.0s)]
*  You are welcome anytime. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=86.8s)]
*  We would love to have you in the great state of Alabama. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=88.2s)]
*  Well, it's great to have you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=91.2s)]
*  It's not your first convention, but your first time speaking. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=93.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=96.3s)]
*  How was it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=97.0s)]
*  It was incredible. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=97.7s)]
*  I mean walking out there last night, Sean, was electric. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=99.1s)]
*  You could feel the energy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=102.7s)]
*  You can feel the hope. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=104.1s)]
*  You can feel the passion for our nation and for Donald Trump and the policies he's going to put in place. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=105.3s)]
*  So it was a really fun night. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=110.8s)]
*  And I think the crowd, this is indicative of the energy we're seeing across the country, what we're seeing here this week. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=112.6s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  We see the Democrats in complete disarray. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=119.3s)]
*  Finally, I've only been saying this since before the 2020 election that Joe Biden is a cognitive mess. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=121.7s)]
*  Now they've discovered that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=126.9s)]
*  Yeah, no, you've been talking about it for years. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=128.1s)]
*  And I blame the national news media that was trying to cover this up as well. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=130.2s)]
*  They're complicit in the fact that he is not able to lead. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=135.0s)]
*  He's not able to do the job today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=138.1s)]
*  And because of that, we've seen this extreme wing socialist Marxist agenda that's taken over the United States of America. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=140.0s)]
*  So that's what the real Americans are waking up to now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=147.0s)]
*  You know, and this does bring up a lot of interesting points, and I think you're right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=151.0s)]
*  And regardless if they were to replace him or not, or he although he steadfastly says that he's going to stay in here, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=154.8s)]
*  they're not, Democrats will not change their policies on the border. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=162.5s)]
*  They're not going to change their economic policies, energy policies, their defund, dismantle, re-imagine, no bail laws. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=166.2s)]
*  They're not going to change their foreign policy, which has been to suck up to Iran and let Vladimir Putin and Russia and China have free reign or enemies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=174.89999999999998s)]
*  Is anything going to change if it's not Joe? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=186.7s)]
*  No, nothing at all. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, and that's what people need to focus on. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=189.7s)]
*  It is the policies of the Democratic Party that have failed everyday Americans. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=191.5s)]
*  I think it's telling that President Trump put there in the platform that it is dedicated to the forgotten men and women of this country. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=196.8s)]
*  And what you see here is us talk about that at every single turn, whether it is our border, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=204.2s)]
*  whether it's abroad, whether it's the mess we see in our cities, whether it's the education of our children, we are in decline under Joe Biden. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=208.9s)]
*  We are diminished and declined just like the gentleman in the office. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=217.7s)]
*  And so now it's time for change. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=222.0s)]
*  You know, in 2015, when Donald Trump came down that escalator, right, a pretty iconic moment, sort of like him standing up with the fist and fight, fight, fight, which fake news CNN criticized. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=223.5s)]
*  But he talked about open borders. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=234.0s)]
*  Now we have a 12 year old girl brutalized for two hours and murdered in Texas. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  13 year old girl raped in broad daylight, New York killed mother of five killed. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=242.3s)]
*  There is a woman. Her name is not Lincoln. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=249.0s)]
*  Her name is Lake and Riley. That's right. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=251.4s)]
*  And everyday Americans are losing their loved ones every single day because we're allowing dangerous criminals, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  unstable mental people that are in their country are not welcome. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=260.3s)]
*  They are putting their responsibility into the United States of America and telling them go to America. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=265.1s)]
*  The border is open and go be there. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=269.8s)]
*  We are not getting the best of the best. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=271.3s)]
*  And they're coming from Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt, Venezuela, tens of thousands from China and Russia. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  And Sean, they refuse to act. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=283.5s)]
*  And in fact, Joe Biden created this crisis and the first 100 days of his presidency, he issued 94 executive orders undoing the work of Donald Trump. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=285.7s)]
*  Donald Trump had the most secure border of all time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  We know how to do that. The Democrats refuse to do it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  I have a Lake and Riley Act in the Senate. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=300.8s)]
*  The Democrats blocked it from actually being able to move forward. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=303.0s)]
*  Just they don't want proof of citizenship. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=306.5s)]
*  They don't want voter ID. They don't want signature verification. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=308.8s)]
*  My question, why not? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  They're remaking the country. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=313.5s)]
*  They're remaking the trying to. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=315.3s)]
*  They are. They're allowing millions and millions of people in here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=316.5s)]
*  And we can do it expeditiously and in a compassionate way. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=319.6s)]
*  If you didn't obey our laws, respect our borders and sovereignty, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=324.3s)]
*  you have to return home and we will give you free transportation, maybe a little money in your pocket if we have to. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=327.6s)]
*  But you're out. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=334.1s)]
*  We love immigrants. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=334.9s)]
*  This country is a country of immigrants. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=336.3s)]
*  We just want people to obey our laws. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=338.2s)]
*  We are a nation of laws. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=339.8s)]
*  People should come here legally and there has to be consequences when you break the law. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=341.5s)]
*  Is it affecting your state, South Dakota? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=344.8s)]
*  You know what? I think people see it, but I can't get any numbers out of Border Patrol. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=346.3s)]
*  I can't get anything out of this administration on if I do have illegal immigrants coming into my state. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=350.0s)]
*  I hear anecdotal evidence. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=355.0s)]
*  But I see the cartels are set up in South Dakota on my reservation territory. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=356.6s)]
*  Most people don't know that Native American tribes and their land are sovereign nations. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=360.6s)]
*  So I have no jurisdiction there and the cartels and their affiliates have figured out they can come across the border, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=365.5s)]
*  come into the middle of our country and set up shop and distribute drugs and human trafficking. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=371.1s)]
*  So it's not just that order anymore. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=375.6s)]
*  It's got to cut you guys off. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  By the way, great to see you, Governor. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED2i2KNiCnc&t=378.90000000000003s)]
