# Hannity: This is the 'Joe Biden cognitive decline cover-up'
**Fox News:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40)
*  President Donald Trump campaigning in a massive rally, tens and tens of thousands of people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=0.0s)]
*  We have pictures coming up in just a second to show you the crowd size. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=5.46s)]
*  This as top Democrats have now called on his opponent, Joe Biden, a step down. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=8.94s)]
*  We've been hearing it since the debate. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=13.02s)]
*  Multiple editorial boards, they have done the same. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  Left-wing hosts, pundits, cable news have been pleading with Joe to please leave the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=18.14s)]
*  race. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Many of Biden's friends and allies publicly diagnosing him with dementia and said he was [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=24.9s)]
*  not capable of serving another four years. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=30.54s)]
*  Even George Stephanopoulos, who just interviewed Biden, said he doesn't think Biden can serve [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=33.68s)]
*  another term. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=38.26s)]
*  This has been transparent. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=39.66s)]
*  This has been obvious for over four years. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=41.42s)]
*  President Trump addressed this tonight as a huge cover-up. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  But everyone around Biden, every Democrat, the state-run media mob, they have all been [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=47.44s)]
*  involved in the Joe Biden cognitive decline cover-up. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=52.82s)]
*  They all lied, and now they're all acting shocked. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=57.300000000000004s)]
*  They're feigning surprise. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=60.1s)]
*  And another, you know, lie of historic proportions. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  They've known the whole time. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=66.58s)]
*  And with that said, well, Joe Biden in many ways, well, just had the best day since the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=68.34s)]
*  debate. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=73.22s)]
*  With the help of his usual teleprompter, the president delivered a whopping, pretty decent [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=74.22s)]
*  for him 15-minute speech in front of NATO. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=79.58s)]
*  Donald Trump's speech just went on nearly an hour and 20 minutes, which should be, by [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=83.1s)]
*  the way, a 15-minute speech, a layup for any U.S. president, especially with a teleprompter. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=87.38s)]
*  Well, for President Biden, it was high drama all day long, all eyes on Biden, article after [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=92.02s)]
*  article. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=98.82s)]
*  The world is watching. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=99.82s)]
*  Our allies are watching. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=100.82s)]
*  And he managed to exceed what were very low expectations. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=102.78s)]
*  And still, it wasn't a particularly strong performance. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=107.06s)]
*  You decide. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=110.22s)]
*  To end Ukraine's democracy, to destroy Ukraine's culture, and to wipe Ukraine off the map. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=111.22s)]
*  Even before Russian bombs were falling in Ukraine, the alliance acted. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=120.61999999999999s)]
*  I ordered the U.S. reinforcements at NATO's eastern flank. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=124.94s)]
*  The United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Italy will provide Ukraine with [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=129.3s)]
*  equipment for five additional strategic air defense systems. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=135.22s)]
*  And key, remember, fellas and ladies, it was supposed to fall in five days. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=140.54000000000002s)]
*  Remember, I am pleased to award you the highest civilian honor the United States can bestow, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=145.58s)]
*  the Presidential Medal of Freedom. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=151.3s)]
*  Ask the military. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=153.9s)]
*  Military, come forward. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=156.66s)]
*  Despite little struggles, while Biden appears to have done enough in his 15-minute speech, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=160.5s)]
*  well, to pretty much stay in the race, maybe even silence some of the calls for him to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  step aside. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=169.62s)]
*  Now, couple that with the consistent support, and that was very evident today, from the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=170.62s)]
*  Congressional Black Caucus. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=177.22s)]
*  And Biden might well make it past the DNC as his party's nominee. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=179.3s)]
*  The odds are higher tonight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=183.94s)]
*  Republican Congressman Jerry Nadler, very disappointed, is once again now supporting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=185.98s)]
*  President Biden, even though he had called for him to step aside, and he showed a lot [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=191.06s)]
*  of consternation in his endorsement. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=196.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=198.54s)]
*  The president made very clear yesterday that he's running. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=199.54s)]
*  And for me, that's dispositive. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=202.54s)]
*  We have to support him. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=203.54s)]
*  Do you have concerns about Biden? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=204.54s)]
*  Do you have concerns about him being on the top of the ticket? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=205.54s)]
*  Do you have concerns about Biden? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=207.14s)]
*  Do you have concerns about him being on the top of the ticket? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=208.82s)]
*  Whether I have concerns or not is beside the point. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=215.5s)]
*  He's going to be our nominee, and we all have to support him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=219.5s)]
*  That was a pretty long pause when you were asked about concerns. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=222.42s)]
*  What are your concerns about President Biden being at the top of the ticket right now? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=225.78s)]
*  I think he has shown that the concerns we've had as a result of the debate, my concern [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=229.02s)]
*  really is that he could have another bad debate performance. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=242.02s)]
*  It appears that Democrats are now resigned to the sad fact that a cognitively impaired [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=245.02s)]
*  Joe Biden will be their party's nominee in 2024. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=250.22s)]
*  The most likely alternative, Vice President Harris is so deeply unpopular, she's still [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=253.7s)]
*  polling lower than Joe, if you can believe that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=258.74s)]
*  By the way, we'll get reaction tonight from Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=261.58000000000004s)]
*  He'll weigh in on the most disliked vice president in American history, who's continued [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=264.98s)]
*  unpopularity all but solidifies Biden's nomination. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=270.54s)]
*  But let's be very clear here tonight. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=274.66s)]
*  This is a nightmare scenario for Democrats. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=277.14000000000004s)]
*  The cat is out of the bag. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=279.18s)]
*  It was never really in the bag, but Democrats, far and wide, have already told the American [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=281.1s)]
*  people that Joe is not fit to serve. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=285.86s)]
*  For once, they were honest, but only because they simply couldn't hide it anymore after [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=288.42s)]
*  that debate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=294.82s)]
*  They've always known, they've always lied, they've always covered up. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=295.82s)]
*  What has been nothing but a repulsive lie cover-up of historic proportions. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=301.3s)]
*  How do you ever trust these people, the Democratic Party, the media mob that were complicit? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=306.94s)]
*  How do you ever trust them again, after all the other lying that they've done? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=314.38s)]
*  But now, well, they're going to ask the American people to vote for this very weak, frail, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=318.76s)]
*  cognitive wreck, a guy who can only really function during the hours of, what, 10 a.m. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=323.65999999999997s)]
*  and 4 p.m., with an afternoon not mixed in, who is now pledging to governors that he will [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=329.34s)]
*  go to bed at 8 p.m. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, that brings us to this old ad from the Clinton campaign. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=336.9s)]
*  It raises a pretty important question. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  More relevant today than ever. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=343.06s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=345.14s)]
*  It's 3 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=346.14s)]
*  But there's a phone in the White House and it's ringing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=349.06s)]
*  Something's happening in the world. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=352.97999999999996s)]
*  Your vote will decide who answers that call. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=358.02s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump never sleeps. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=359.02s)]
*  So what happens if Biden gets a 3 a.m. phone call? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=361.38s)]
*  What would happen during a real crisis when the president is needed around the clock, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=364.58s)]
*  24 straight hours, 36, 48 hours straight? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=369.18s)]
*  Who's going to be in charge when your beleaguered president falls asleep? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  Who decides? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=377.54s)]
*  Or becomes so sick, maybe he has a cold, he can no longer function, or has a hard time [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  shaking off jet lag two weeks after an international trip? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=383.94s)]
*  You know, will Dr. Jill Biden be in charge? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=388.02000000000004s)]
*  She certainly appears to be a little drunk with power, but the first lady, she was not [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=391.3s)]
*  elected president, is not qualified to serve as president. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=395.98s)]
*  On Monday, she hit the campaign trail while Joe stayed home, multiple stops, three states. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=400.14000000000004s)]
*  Her husband rested, prepping for his big 15-minute NATO speech, likely joined by his son Hunter. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=406.34000000000003s)]
*  Is this a sign that Hunter's going to play a bigger role in another Biden term? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=412.66s)]
*  According to reports, the former admitted addict, admitted he had no experience, for [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=417.06s)]
*  example, you know, running an international family syndicate, becomes a businessman, recently [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=423.06s)]
*  participating in high-level meetings with his father? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=429.66s)]
*  Pretty frightening scenario. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  And what happens when Biden ultimately gets even worse? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  Remember, we don't officially know Biden's current medical condition. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=439.02000000000004s)]
*  Now, John Solomon, JustTheNews.com, reporting tonight, House Oversight Committee Chairman [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=442.82000000000005s)]
*  James Comer is now going to subpoena Biden's doctor and seek records from Biden's medical [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=447.94000000000005s)]

*  Take a look at this. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=455.70000000000005s)]
*  Now we've asked for the White House physician to come in. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=456.70000000000005s)]
*  We expect him to come in for a transcribed interview or I'll subpoena him for a deposition. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=459.06s)]
*  Either way, we're going to ask a lot of questions about the report that the White House physician [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=463.82s)]
*  issued just a few months ago that said Joe Biden was in tip-top physical condition. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=470.58000000000004s)]
*  By the way, if he's in such tip-top shape, release the hurt tapes. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=475.74s)]
*  Now, despite all of the uncertainty, it does appear the elites in the Democratic Party, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=479.38s)]
*  they have failed to oust Joe. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=484.34000000000003s)]
*  Now, remember, Biden won the Democratic primary by the voters' voter form. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=485.94s)]
*  It appears now that the will of the primary voters will be respected even if it leads [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=490.62s)]
*  to a disaster come November. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=496.21999999999997s)]
*  The polls, they're not looking good for Joe Biden in Wisconsin now. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=498.46s)]
*  He's running a full 12 points behind the Democratic senator, and Trump is up in every [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=501.58s)]
*  battleground state. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=506.82s)]
*  But a lot can happen between now and November. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=508.35999999999996s)]
*  Democrats just imported millions of illegal immigrants. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=510.85999999999996s)]
*  Right now, this is going on in Washington. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=514.5s)]
*  They're now planning to block the SAVE Act. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=516.74s)]
*  That would require voters to prove American citizenship before voting and before registering [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=520.02s)]
*  to vote. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=526.4200000000001s)]
*  So, why are Democrats so fiercely against proof of citizenship, voter ID, signature [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=527.4200000000001s)]
*  verification? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=534.1800000000001s)]
*  Why are they against any and all election integrity efforts so we can have integrity [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=535.46s)]
*  confidence in our results? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=541.8s)]
*  In multiple states, mail-in ballots, drop boxes will once again take center stage. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=543.96s)]
*  Early voting starts in 68 days. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=549.98s)]
*  This is not a secure process. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=552.9s)]
*  To make matters worse, whoever wins the nomination will undoubtedly get the usual support from [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=555.08s)]
*  the state-run media mob. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=560.72s)]
*  They will get in line, and another, you know, protective bubble might soon start to form [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=562.56s)]
*  around Joe Biden. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=567.8s)]
*  But the American people, you now know the truth, you see the truth, and you know they've [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=569.42s)]
*  been lying for four-plus years. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=574.38s)]
*  They know Joe is struggling. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=577.14s)]
*  They've always known. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=578.86s)]
*  They can feel his disastrous policies. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=580.1s)]
*  They lie about those. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=582.52s)]
*  And hopefully, change is on the way. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKhP7UuI40&t=584.34s)]
