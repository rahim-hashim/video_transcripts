# Donald Trump: The Democrats' campaign is not one of joy, it's a campaign of hatred
**Fox News:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU)
*  All right, we are just seven days away from election night, although every day is election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=0.0s)]
*  day until then, because if there's voting in America, it's election day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=5.64s)]
*  Earlier today, I sat down with former President Trump for an exclusive interview. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=9.52s)]
*  Here's part one of that interview. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=14.36s)]
*  Mr. President, you're great. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=16.2s)]
*  This will be one week from today's election day, the last interview I will ever have with [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  you as a candidate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=25.12s)]
*  I'm sure you're probably not thinking about that yet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  Well, not really, but it's a little bit sad. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=29.68s)]
*  We've been together a long time as a candidate. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=32.36s)]
*  Now we can be together maybe toward making America great again, because we have to do that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=34.4s)]
*  You know, it is amazing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  With one week to go, how are you feeling about the race? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=43.16s)]
*  I think we're leading in every state, every swing state. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=46.92s)]
*  I think we're even picking up maybe some states that traditionally don't go Republican. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=49.72s)]
*  People want to see change. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=55.96s)]
*  They don't want to have borders where murderers are being released into our country and many [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=56.96s)]
*  others, drug dealers, where jails are being emptied out into our country. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=60.88s)]
*  I happen to think this is the biggest issue. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=65.44s)]
*  I think inflation would be second to horrible inflation in an economy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=66.8s)]
*  I mean, the economy went bad because of inflation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=70.28s)]
*  We had no inflation whatsoever. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=73.2s)]
*  We had a great economy, maybe the best ever. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=74.9s)]
*  I think the best economy anyone's ever had. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=77.0s)]
*  And when you see what's happened to our country, it's very sad. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=80.84s)]
*  When you see what they're allowing to come into our country and kill people, I've just [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=83.92s)]
*  randomly just killed so many people. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Young girls are dying left and right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=91.44s)]
*  We can't let this happen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=94.84s)]
*  I think it's the most important issue. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=95.84s)]
*  And we're talking about by the thousands. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=97.72s)]
*  They're coming in by the hundreds of thousands and even the millions. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=99.84s)]
*  And so they have 21 million people released into our country through a ridiculous open [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=103.52s)]
*  border policy of Kamala. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=109.92s)]
*  You have to blame her because she was put in charge of the border by Biden, who went [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=113.28s)]
*  to sleep at 4 o'clock. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=116.64s)]
*  And she's done a horrible job. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=118.72s)]
*  And by the way, I think it's very important for your listeners to know that the Border [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=120.2s)]
*  Patrol endorsed me powerfully and said she was horrible. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=122.86000000000001s)]
*  They said I was the best ever and that she's the worst ever. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=127.4s)]
*  So it shouldn't be that much of a choice. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=131.08s)]
*  In her own words, and this has frustrated me in the campaign, the media has covered [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=133.0s)]
*  for her. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, they're an extension of her press office. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  She has said in her own words she wants to decriminalize illegal immigration. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  Free food, housing, healthcare, education, her running mate, legal drivers licenses for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=144.44s)]
*  illegals, free taxpayer-funded college, free sex change surgeries. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=150.27999999999997s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  And defund the police. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  And amnesty. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  And defund the police. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  Don't forget, she was one of the leaders of Defund the Police. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  That means it's in her psyche, defunding the police. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  We have to do the opposite. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=165.56s)]
*  We have to let the police do their job. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  We can't take away their house and their pension and their family and everything else [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  if they are a little bit more aggressive. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=172.6s)]
*  We have â€” our country is a crime-ridden country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=176.0s)]
*  When they go into department stores and they strip the store, they strip the store and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  our police are standing out there wanting to do their job, but they're told stand [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=184.2s)]
*  down, don't touch anybody. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  And they're walking out with refrigerators and they're walking out with air conditioners. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=190.88s)]
*  And there's hundreds of â€” [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  They let them walk away as long as it's under $1,000. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=197.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=200.24s)]
*  Well, that was her policy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=201.24s)]
*  Anything under $950, you don't prosecute. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=203.04s)]
*  But really, it's much worse. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=206.2s)]
*  They don't prosecute anyway. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=207.84s)]
*  The only ones they go after is me, people like me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=208.96s)]
*  They go after Catholics. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=212.02s)]
*  They go after â€” and evangelicals will be next. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=213.72s)]
*  This is a horrible group of people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=217.5s)]
*  These are very dangerous people. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=219.4s)]
*  They will use limited resources to look into moms and dads at school board meetings as [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=222.16s)]
*  potential domestic terrorists. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=229.0s)]
*  We're now â€” with the final week of this campaign, we have two very, very different [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=231.48s)]
*  closing arguments that have emerged. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=237.88s)]
*  Kamala's closing argument, her surrogates, Nazi, fascist, racist, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=240.32s)]
*  I thought this was supposed to be the campaign of joy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't seem very joyful to me. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=254.0s)]
*  What's your reaction when you hear that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=256.36s)]
*  They have no joy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=258.48s)]
*  They took it away from a man. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=260.38s)]
*  I'm not a fan of Biden, obviously, but he had 14 million votes. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=261.72s)]
*  She got no votes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=266.32s)]
*  She was the last in â€” 22 people ran. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=267.8s)]
*  She was last. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=270.44s)]
*  She came in last, never made it to Iowa. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=271.44s)]
*  They went in and they said, you're not running anymore. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=274.08s)]
*  We're taking it away. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=276.52s)]
*  They took it away. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=277.52s)]
*  Much more easily than I would have thought he would have. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=279.08s)]
*  But this is not a campaign of joy for them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=281.84s)]
*  It's a campaign of hatred. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=283.76s)]
*  You know, my father â€” and I mentioned this for the first time yesterday. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  I was in Pennsylvania and I mentioned it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=288.08s)]
*  I said, my father, when I was young, never mentioned the name Hitler, ever. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  He was tough on it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=296.56s)]
*  Somebody would say Hitler. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=299.08s)]
*  Never mentioned that name. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=300.32s)]
*  Nazi. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=302.12s)]
*  Never mentioned. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=303.12s)]
*  Never mentioned that name. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  And he meant it, too. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=307.4s)]
*  And it was a word that you never use. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=309.6s)]
*  You know, you never use those words. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=310.96s)]
*  It's the embodiment of evil. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=312.36s)]
*  And now they accuse me of being a Nazi. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=313.8s)]
*  They accuse me of being a Hitler-type guy or a Hitler lover. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=316.44s)]
*  And I'm not. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=323.96s)]
*  I'm the opposite. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=324.96s)]
*  They're the ones that are doing â€” they're oppressive. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=325.96s)]
*  This is like an oppressive machine. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=328.08s)]
*  And you know, they also happen to have the press, for whatever reason. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=330.44s)]
*  Think of what they're fighting for. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=334.24s)]
*  They're fighting for open borders where millions of people can pour into our country. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=336.56s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=341.12s)]
*  Millions of â€” who can get elected with that? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=342.12s)]
*  They're thinking of having men playing in women's sports. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=349.12s)]
*  I've been a politician now for nine years. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=350.12s)]
*  I can't â€” I hate to say I'm a politician, but I guess I'm a politician. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  Nobody's ever come to me and said, sir, it's really important that we let men play [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=356.32s)]
*  in women's sports. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=361.24s)]
*  Sir, transgender operations all over the place are really important. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=362.92s)]
*  Nobody ever brought this stuff up. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=367.12s)]

*  Could you do this? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=370.04s)]
*  Could you do that? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=371.04s)]
*  Could you help me here? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=372.04s)]
*  My businesses? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=373.04s)]
*  You know, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=374.04s)]
*  They bring up a lot of things. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=375.04s)]
*  But nobody ever came to me and said, it's really important that we do this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=376.04s)]
*  Men should play in women's sports. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=379.68s)]
*  I think it's got a constituency about almost nothing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=381.52s)]
*  And yet they do it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=385.52s)]
*  Maybe it's because they want to destroy the country. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=386.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=388.68s)]
*  Or gender-affirming care for minors. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=389.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=391.76s)]
*  Without parental consent. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  So, a young man leaves for school and goes to school, and the authority takes him over [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=394.71999999999997s)]

*  I mean, is this supposed to be America? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=407.2s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=409.96s)]
*  That doesn't sound right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=410.96s)]
*  These people are radical people. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=411.96s)]
*  And let me tell you, she's not a smart person. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=412.96s)]
*  She's a low-IQ individual. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=414.52s)]
*  I've said it for a long time. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=415.52s)]
*  She speaks so slowly. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=418.14s)]
*  Everything's so slow. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=419.64s)]
*  She thinks of answers to ask her questions. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=421.28s)]
*  She talks about she was grown up with a lawn growing on her front yard. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=423.2s)]
*  Everything is like crazy. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=428.55999999999995s)]
*  60 Minutes protects her. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=430.03999999999996s)]
*  60 Minutes takes out her answer and puts a new answer in because her answer was so bad. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  Could you imagine them doing â€” I'd love to have them do it for me. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  Think of it, John. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  60 Minutes, CBS, they should lose their license. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=443.91999999999996s)]
*  This isn't just editing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=446.76s)]
*  They took out her whole answer, every word, and they put a totally different answer in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=448.64s)]
*  so that she looked better because she looked like a very stupid person if they would have [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  left the original answer. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=457.88s)]
*  I've never even heard of a thing like that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=459.28s)]
*  You mentioned your father. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=462.2s)]
*  And you did have â€” I know the media would like to focus on the comments of one general, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=463.2s)]
*  but you had, about a week or so ago, 200 former generals, admirals, all come out in support [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=468.4s)]
*  of you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=474.2s)]
*  Nobody wants to talk about â€” [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=475.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=476.2s)]
*  From the administration, the most respected people â€” I see even Bill Barr's name was [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=477.24s)]
*  mentioned â€” and they said, well, that's nice, because he understood â€” look, he understood [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  I did a hell of a good job. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=487.2s)]
*  And so did everyone. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=489.88s)]
*  They signed a document. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=491.24s)]
*  Over 300 people. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=493.12s)]
*  The press will not put it out. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=494.12s)]
*  I'm so glad â€” you guys, thank you for asking this question. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=495.56s)]
*  But I had over 300 of the top people from intelligence, generals, everybody, from the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=498.8s)]
*  administration saying Trump was a great president. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=504.84000000000003s)]
*  But the press won't put that out. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  They just don't. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=510.2s)]
*  Look, we have a very, very corrupt and dishonest press. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=511.2s)]
*  And I think with time, it gets better, because they're all doing pretty badly. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=515.4s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=518.88s)]
*  You mentioned your father said never say the word Nazi. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=521.72s)]
*  And you even have NBC News showing â€” comparing Madison Square Garden to the Nazi rally â€” and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=526.2s)]
*  I'll get to MSG in a second, and I'll get to your closing arguments. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=531.32s)]
*  But what's interesting is, if you want to talk about the embodiment of evil â€” you [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=535.24s)]
*  talk about Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini â€” and they are pounding this. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=539.36s)]
*  It is their closing argument. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  This is the environment we're in. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=546.7600000000001s)]
*  But it's the only thing they can do, Sean. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  Because look, I had the best economy in history. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=550.24s)]
*  I had the strongest border and the border wall. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=553.1600000000001s)]
*  I built 500 miles of wall. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=555.48s)]
*  And without that wall, nobody could do anything. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=558.12s)]
*  You couldn't. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=560.2800000000001s)]
*  I remember they used to say, you don't need a wall. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=562.24s)]
*  What are you going to do, send some drones up to look around? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=563.24s)]
*  She called it a vanity project, a medieval vanity project. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=564.64s)]
*  Yeah, but now they have to do it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=567.8s)]
*  Now they have to â€” in the meantime, they put in for funding to do a wall. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=568.8s)]
*  Look, I had the best economy ever. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=571.4399999999999s)]
*  We cut more regulations than ever cut. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=574.28s)]
*  I had no wars. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=576.8399999999999s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=578.36s)]
*  No wars. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=579.36s)]
*  Except I finished off a war that they couldn't finish. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=580.36s)]
*  They wouldn't have finished it off in 10 years. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  I did it in a few weeks. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=584.0s)]
*  ISIS. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=585.36s)]
*  I knocked out ISIS. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=586.36s)]
*  I rebuilt our military. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=587.6s)]
*  I gave you the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=589.72s)]
*  We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=593.2s)]
*  We were lapping â€” think of it â€” we were lapping China. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=596.1s)]
*  I took out hundreds of billions of dollars from China in the form of taxes and tariffs. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  Nobody thought it was even possible. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=604.82s)]
*  And China respected us, and everybody respected us. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=606.76s)]
*  Viktor Orban said he was the most respected leader. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=609.72s)]
*  And now we have these clowns that look so bad. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=613.08s)]
*  They make us look so bad. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=617.4s)]
*  Nobody can believe what's happened to our country. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=619.84s)]
*  If their closing argument and their surrogates are doubled down and tripled down and quadrupled [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=622.92s)]
*  down on Nazi, Nazi, fascist, fascist, think of the environment we're in. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=627.92s)]
*  In Butler, Pennsylvania, you came within a millimeter of being murdered, assassinated. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=633.52s)]
*  We had Trump International. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=640.68s)]
*  You had a would-be assassin in the bushes with an AK-47 with a scope on it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=642.2399999999999s)]

*  I am told â€” you can confirm if you want or not â€” Iranian hit squads are in this [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=650.7199999999999s)]

*  them no. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=665.92s)]
*  She herself is using some of these words. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=668.04s)]
*  Tim Walz is using these Nazi analogies. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=670.56s)]
*  And in light of the environment and what has happened and assassination squads being here, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=673.84s)]
*  I mean, what is your reaction to the fact that they won't stand up morally and say, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=680.76s)]
*  stop with the Nazi fascist garbage and let's argue on the issues of the day and whoever [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xB5kiLoIcU&t=686.52s)]
