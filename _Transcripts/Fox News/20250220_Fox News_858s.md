# Hannity debates Ragin’ Cajun James Carville on Trump’s return to office
**Fox News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M)
*  So, where do Democrats go from here? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=0.0s)]
*  And will common sense ever return to that party? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=2.56s)]
*  Here with more. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=5.22s)]
*  We call him the raging cajun himself, Democratic strategist James Carville. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=6.22s)]
*  You know, I was telling people today that you're going to be on the show, and I was—on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=9.36s)]
*  the radio, I was reminding people we would do debates against each other around the country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=16.48s)]
*  You're one of the most fun people to ever hang out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=21.12s)]
*  But you're also one of the smartest strategists I've ever met. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=23.38s)]
*  You are. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=26.44s)]
*  And I'm not sucking up. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=27.44s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=28.44s)]
*  Your old boss with Newt Gingrich balanced the budget five times. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=29.44s)]
*  It hasn't happened since. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Now your party is against tens of billions spent abroad for Green New Deal, DEI, woke [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=36.44s)]
*  agenda and transgenderism. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=42.2s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, we've got to get that $100 million for condoms for Hamas, because that's where [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  all the savings are. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  I haven't seen— [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Cute answer. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  There's tens and hundreds of billions. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  There's tens and hundreds of billions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  You went for 10 minutes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  All right, go ahead. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  If he can find the money, great, give everybody $1,000. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=58.72s)]
*  But I'll tell you this, more deficit has accumulated under Donald Trump than the other president [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=65.56s)]
*  of American history. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=69.6s)]
*  But I'm glad that you're on the fiscal responsibility bandwagon. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=70.6s)]
*  I'm glad you're on the bandwagon of Bill Clinton being able to balance the budget and bring [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  unbelievable prosperity to America. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=79.02s)]
*  And you're reading these polls, and I'm reading the polls saying the Democrats are 13 points [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=81.72s)]
*  up in the Congressional generic that Donald Trump has the lowest approval rating of any [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=86.28s)]
*  president at this point in his presidency in American history. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=90.4s)]
*  So your viewers are getting one view, and I'm reading another view. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=93.4s)]
*  So one of us is right and one of us is wrong. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=98.2s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=101.0s)]
*  We put on Trafalgar— [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=102.0s)]
*  They got fact checkers at Fox and— [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=103.0s)]
*  Well, we do, and we put on Trafalgar and Matt Towery and Robert Cahaly and an insider advantage. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=105.0s)]
*  And by the way, for the last three presidential elections, they were the top pollsters in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=112.44s)]
*  the country, among the top three. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=116.16s)]
*  So they're pretty credible to me. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=118.0s)]
*  Let's put that aside. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=120.0s)]
*  Look at our four polls that are getting the lowest approval at this point in history. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=121.0s)]
*  But if your viewers want to believe this, go ahead and believe it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=125.52s)]
*  I mean, I can't do anything about it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=129.4s)]
*  If they want to believe that Donald Trump— [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=131.68s)]
*  Listen, didn't you believe or are you telling— [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=133.44s)]
*  I'm going to congratulate you on good journalism. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=135.44s)]
*  You asked him about Medicaid. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=138.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=139.32s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=140.32s)]
*  That's the most constipated answer I've ever heard in my life, but you did your job. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=141.4s)]
*  I'm going to give you credit for being an insightful and good journalist. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  I appreciate you giving me credit, James. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=147.84s)]
*  I do. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=149.4s)]
*  You're a fun guy to debate. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=150.4s)]
*  Listen, you said you want to talk about the polls you believed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=153.0s)]
*  Your polls told you Kamala Harris is going to be president, didn't they? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=157.32s)]
*  You were predicting she's going to win. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=160.24s)]
*  What happened? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=162.1s)]
*  The polls were tough. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=163.1s)]
*  Because my pollsters got it right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=164.1s)]
*  They predicted Donald Trump would win. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=165.1s)]
*  So we—let me back up. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  We went with our seventh-string quarterback, and we lost by a point and a half, and we [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=169.84s)]
*  actually picked up a congressional seat. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  So if you're asking me, did I think that she was going to win and she didn't win, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=175.44s)]
*  yes, all the polls showed it even. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=179.12s)]
*  It turned out to be a point and a half race. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=181.12s)]
*  But—and you lost seats. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=184.36s)]
*  But if you haven't—and I'm telling the Democrats, just sit there, play possum, let [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=186.24s)]
*  them go, let them go, let them go. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Poll numbers are declining. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=193.84s)]
*  The collapse is already underway. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=196.08s)]
*  When they put the Medicaid budget, when they put the tax, the $4.5 billion, trillion dollars [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=198.84s)]
*  of tax cuts to wealthy people, just let them all come to you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=204.96s)]
*  We don't need to be aggressive now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=209.68s)]
*  We can just sit back. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=210.96s)]
*  All right, so you trust CBS? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=211.96s)]
*  And they're going to have to come— [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=212.96s)]
*  Because CBS had them on the positive side. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=213.96s)]
*  American people agree with them on immigration. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=216.52s)]
*  They agree with them on reckless spending. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=218.44s)]
*  They agree with eliminating waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  What happened—you know, Bill Clinton—and I'll give him credit where credit's due. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=223.8s)]
*  I mean, he—and I give as much credit to Newt Gingrich, to be honest, and the fact [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=228.28s)]
*  that he had such a bad first midterm. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=232.68s)]
*  And the era of big government is over, and the welfare as we know it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  And they balanced the budget, the two of them, together. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=239.32000000000002s)]
*  They work together. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=241.84s)]
*  I see your party screaming and yelling and acting like lunatics, and you're smarter [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=242.84s)]
*  than that, because that's not you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=248.56s)]
*  And you're kind of spinning a little on me, because you got your ass kicked in this election, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=251.4s)]
*  and everyone thought you were all going to win. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  I lost a point. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=256.88s)]
*  I definitely lost my point and a half. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=258.2s)]
*  But all you have to do—you can go to real clear politics. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  There's actually a conservative-leaning site. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  And they won all the poll averages. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=267.79999999999995s)]
*  You can look them up. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=270.0s)]
*  You can—it's right there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=271.0s)]
*  It is not some kind of secret thing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=272.88s)]
*  If you go back and you look at—polling was actually very accurate in the 2024 election. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=277.44s)]
*  I mean, there was a certain infinite stuff that you can get that you can get wrong. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=282.52s)]
*  But yeah, now, look, again, 13-point lead in the congressional race. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=289.76s)]
*  The Democrats are almost certain to win the Virginia governor's race. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=295.2s)]
*  I mean, about—no, not almost. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  They are certain to win it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=300.0s)]
*  And they're certain to win the House of Representatives back. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=301.84s)]
*  And that's just a fact. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=304.84s)]
*  You can look and see, and Trump is the lowest-rated president at this point of any president in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=307.68s)]
*  American history. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=312.56s)]
*  It's a fact. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=313.56s)]
*  Well, on what poll are you citing? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=314.56s)]
*  Because I'm citing Matt Towery, Robert Kaling— [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=316.2s)]
*  I'm fighting poll and averages. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=318.44s)]
*  —and the CBS poll. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=319.44s)]
*  You can go— [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=320.44s)]
*  So you want me to go to the real clear politics average, but if you look at— [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=321.44s)]

*  Go ahead. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=328.32s)]
*  If you look at the CBS poll, on topic after topic, the country's agreeing with his agenda, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=329.56s)]
*  not with your party's agenda. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=334.76000000000005s)]
*  What was Trump's job approval in the CBS poll? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=338.48s)]
*  I think it was about 50 percent, but it was—I've seen polls where it was 54, 55. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=341.0s)]
*  I think it was under that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  I think it was under that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=348.32000000000005s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  But if you look at it, then you break it down by issue. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=350.32000000000005s)]
*  If so, it's poll is part of—I mean, it's not going to do any good for us to sit here [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  and argue it, because your viewers can believe you, and it can go to real clear politics, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  and they can actually see it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=361.16s)]
*  It's not like there's some hidden information that people in Washington are passing around [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=363.48s)]
*  each other. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  It's there. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  He is the lowest-rated president a month into his presidency than any president in the United [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  States history. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=372.88s)]
*  That's the fact. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=373.88s)]
*  I can be fact-checked. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=374.88s)]
*  They can do whatever they want. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=375.88s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=377.88s)]
*  We can go back and forth. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=378.88s)]
*  You wrote in New York Times op-ed, three reasons I am certain that Kamala Harris will win. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=379.88s)]
*  And you laid out your three reasons. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=385.8s)]
*  And another point you actually said, I'm just saying I'm doubling down that I think [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=388.16s)]
*  Harris is going to win. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  You said that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=393.92s)]
*  And I'm sure you went by the same polls that you're citing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=395.12s)]
*  Here's my question, though. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=397.6s)]
*  To me, if you want to be the party where the Democrats defend men playing in women's sports, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=399.68s)]
*  if you want to be the party that stands up for illegal immigrants' rights over safety [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=408.56s)]
*  and security of Americans, because they let millions of unvetted illegals in this country, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=412.72s)]
*  including terrorists and cartel members and murderers, if you want to be the party that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=417.52s)]
*  is going to fight against spending hundreds of billions of dollars in waste, fraud and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=421.52s)]
*  abuse, I think it's a bad strategy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=425.84s)]
*  And as somebody, I respect you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=428.56s)]
*  I would think you would agree with me that Democrats should stand with Donald Trump on [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=431.64s)]
*  getting rid of that waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=436.32s)]
*  So I've missed an election call. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=440.08s)]
*  OK? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm a gambler. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  I bet against the points for that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  I was actually 26 and 6 publicly in my last 32 picks, but I missed 6. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  I got 26 right, but I missed 6. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=451.2s)]
*  Pretty good. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=453.08s)]
*  OK? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=454.08s)]
*  I missed an election, for God's sake, because everybody, every political consultant always [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=455.08s)]
*  gets every election exactly right. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=460.08s)]
*  So let's just say I missed a call. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=462.4s)]
*  I think the Republican Party is against the minimum wage. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  I think the Republican Party stands for more tax cuts for people making over $400,000 a [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=467.64s)]
*  year. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=472.88s)]
*  I think the Republican Party wants to get rid of a woman's right to choose. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=473.92s)]
*  I think the Republican Party wants to destroy Medicaid. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=477.76s)]
*  I think the Republican Party would like to get rid of Medicare, if they possibly can. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=480.36s)]
*  I think the Republican Party supports Vladimir Putin. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=484.76s)]
*  I think the Republican Party is weak when it comes to Communist China. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=487.8s)]
*  So there are a lot of issues of which I have profound and deep disagreements with the Republican [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=491.24s)]
*  Party on. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=496.04s)]
*  I must tell you that in all honesty. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=497.04s)]
*  And there are many things that the Democrats want to do that I really believe in. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=499.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=503.88s)]
*  Well, you didn't answer his— [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=504.88s)]
*  I don't know if any Democrat ran for whether women or men play in sports. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=505.88s)]
*  I know of no Democrat— [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=509.24s)]
*  Oh, they're out there advocating it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=510.24s)]
*  —that ran on high school sports. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=511.24s)]
*  Well, I haven't—I don't know of them. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=513.24s)]
*  And if they do, I'm all for them. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=515.8000000000001s)]
*  I hear a lot of Democrats— [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  I'll let the high school athlete— [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=517.8000000000001s)]
*  I hear a lot of Democrats standing up for illegal immigrants, and they don't want to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=520.36s)]
*  deport them. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=525.0s)]
*  They want to have sanctuary states and cities. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=526.0s)]
*  I don't hear—I hear a lot of Democrats, like Kamala, saying she's against fracking [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=528.28s)]
*  and drilling until she's running for election. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=532.24s)]
*  I see a lot of Democrats, you know, do support men their rights to play women's sports. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=535.24s)]
*  And you're not addressing those key issues that are— [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=540.88s)]
*  Honestly, I don't—it's the key issue with the high school athletic association [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=543.88s)]
*  decides who's eligible to play what sport. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=551.16s)]
*  It's the key issue we're going to continue to help people with health care, with Medicaid [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=553.6s)]
*  and Medicare, or the key issues that we're going to retire people—sacrifice people's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=559.64s)]
*  retirement security. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=562.6s)]
*  The key issue is in this century, under Democratic presidents, 50 million jobs have been created [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=563.8000000000001s)]
*  and 1 million jobs under Republicans. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=570.1600000000001s)]
*  I think most Democrats that I know want to create jobs, create opportunity for people, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=572.52s)]
*  and create opportunity for young people. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=577.36s)]
*  I don't know of anybody that's sitting there worrying about who plays in the high [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  school track meet. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=583.36s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=584.6s)]
*  Okay, well, maybe you're not listening to the same Democrats I am. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=587.28s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=590.6s)]
*  All right, now, on the side of our screen, I am scrolling all of the waste, fraud and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=591.6s)]
*  abuse, and this is money that is not spent on this country. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=597.04s)]
*  They've identified tens and tens and tens of billions of dollars, and this is being [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=600.12s)]
*  spent on the radical Green New Deal, DEI, wokeism, transgenderism, LGBTQ+. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=604.56s)]
*  With the exception of John Fetterman, I don't hear Democrats saying, you know what, we ought [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  not be spending the American people's money this way. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  What say you? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=621.52s)]
*  I see you got USAID up there. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=622.52s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=625.7199999999999s)]
*  They spent $41 billion. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  They spent $41 billion. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=627.7199999999999s)]
*  The federal budget is $6 trillion. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  I did the mayor, Sean. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=634.16s)]
*  It actually comes to something like 0.014 percent. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  So take the 41 billion, put it against the 6 trillion, and see what you've done when [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=641.96s)]
*  your president is responsible for more federal debt than any president in the history of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=648.2s)]
*  the United States. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=653.72s)]
*  So I'll spot you the 41 billion. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=655.4000000000001s)]
*  Now we've— [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=659.0400000000001s)]
*  I'll take it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=660.0400000000001s)]
*  I'll take it and give it back. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  Now we've $5 billion, 998 billion or whatever you got. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=662.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  I did the math on USAID. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=666.0400000000001s)]
*  You got it right up there. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=667.2s)]
*  Okay, USAID is— [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=668.2s)]
*  $41 billion out of 6 trillion. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=669.2s)]
*  But James, you're smarter than this. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=671.76s)]
*  I'm working at the screen. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=673.24s)]
*  Because I'm listening really closely to you. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=674.8000000000001s)]
*  And USAID is 1 percent of what they're finding, and they're finding it in every department [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=678.12s)]
*  of government. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=685.2s)]
*  And they're finding all this DEI money. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=686.2s)]
*  How much in the total? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  I got a whole packet of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=688.6800000000001s)]
*  Somebody said they came up with 8. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=692.84s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1qs70a7c0M&t=694.84s)]
