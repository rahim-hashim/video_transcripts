# Trump Jr.: The 'Trump-deranged' Dems can't help themselves
**Fox News:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs)
*  Donald Trump Jr. is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, I've known your dad a long time. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=1.8s)]
*  And I've always known he's a force of nature. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=5.16s)]
*  And by the way, you know, I would say you're probably not far off yourself. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=8.36s)]
*  And I've known him for a long time. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=14.16s)]
*  I've neverâ€”he's never been this dialed in, in my view. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=16.52s)]
*  He's never been this focused, this committed, and seemingly at peace and happy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=21.04s)]
*  Am I wrong in that observation? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=28.06s)]
*  I think you're actually 100 percent right, Sean. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=30.02s)]
*  It actually took the last four years of abject disaster for him to figure out who his friends [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=33.78s)]
*  are, who the people who are loyal are, and for the American public to understand just [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=39.14s)]
*  how fragile this incredible experiment of America really is. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=43.36s)]
*  We saw it disappear like that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=47.1s)]
*  We went from a time of peace to a time of war. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=49.34s)]
*  We went from a time of prosperity to a time of poverty. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=52.44s)]
*  It went away in an instant, Sean. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=56.38s)]
*  And so now he knows who those people are. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=58.7s)]
*  Frankly, in 2016, he didn't have that knowledge. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=60.74s)]
*  He had to trust people from the outside to say, this guy's on your side. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  Turns out they weren't. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=66.82000000000001s)]
*  They were kicking the can down the road. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  It was permanent Washington. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=69.94s)]
*  We're going to wait him out, and we're going to get back to business as usual. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=71.62s)]
*  But the last four years, he learned so much. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=74.64s)]
*  He figured out who he can trust. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=76.9s)]
*  And now he has a cabinet that is 100 percent in lockstep with America First policies. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=78.62s)]
*  The things that he wants to do, they are going to actually make those things happen, not [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=84.94000000000001s)]
*  tell him what he wants to hear, and then go do the opposite inside the halls of whatever [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=88.86s)]
*  agency they work. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=93.22s)]
*  So it was really amazing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  All the Democrats had to do was not play their games in 2020. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=96.34s)]
*  You would have had the same can kicking from 2020 till now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=101.22s)]
*  You'd probably end up with a Democrat president right now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=104.5s)]
*  But now you have the most supercharged, knowledgeable, aggressive Trump that you can possibly have. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=107.18s)]
*  That was the mandate from the American people, because, again, they saw their American dream [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=113.9s)]
*  slip away so rapidly over the four years of the Biden administration that they're seeing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=118.2s)]
*  these wins. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=123.34s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=124.34s)]
*  The same Democrats that told us you can't really do anything about the border, border [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=125.34s)]
*  crossings are down 95 percent, and it's only been a month. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=128.86s)]
*  Doge has uncovered 100 billion in waste, 100 billion, Sean. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=133.38s)]
*  Imagine what we could do for American people who have been suffering or schools that are [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  indoctrinating and not educating our children, or a broken health care system, or crumbling [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=143.5s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=148.86s)]
*  Think of what we can do with four years of these kinds of fines, once Elon and his team [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=149.86s)]
*  get into the rest of the administration and the rest of the agencies that have just been [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=156.02s)]
*  playing games. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  No one actually thought that giving $5 million to trans-ELMO programs in Guatemala was great [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=162.06s)]
*  use of their funds. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=167.86s)]
*  There's so much we can do. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=169.3s)]
*  The possibilities are, frankly, endless, and he sees that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=171.45999999999998s)]
*  The American people see it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  They finally have opened their eyes to what is possible, and we are going to unleash all [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=177.5s)]
*  of that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  I just couldn't be more proud of everything that he's doing right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  The hatred of your father, I would argue, has been predictable, because after the denial, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=185.82s)]
*  after the grief, after the depression, they always seem to settle back on the rage portion [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=190.66s)]
*  of what the radical Democratic Party is. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=195.82s)]
*  What I didn't anticipate is that they would double, quadruple down on, oh, we'll be [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=199.16s)]
*  the party that puts illegal immigrant rights over the American people and their safety. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=204.24s)]
*  We're going to be the party that champions the right of men to play in women's sports. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=209.96s)]
*  We're going to be the party that is going to claim we have a constitutional crisis, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=214.4s)]
*  because Elon Musk, your father, department heads, are discovering hundreds of billions [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  of dollars in waste, fraud, abuse, corruption, not being spent on the American people, but [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  abroad, you're right, on DEI programs, wokeism, transgenderism, and the Green New Deal. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=230.68s)]
*  They have settled on that agenda. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=238.56s)]
*  It's actually amazing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  I love to see them go all in on these issues, and I think my father's superpower is finding [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  like a 90-10 issue, taking the 90 side, and because of their Trump derangement syndrome, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  many know it as TDS, but because of the Democrats' Trump derangement syndrome, they can't help [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=254.28s)]
*  themselves. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=259.56s)]
*  They go all in on these issues that are just widely unpopular with real Americans, because [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=260.56s)]
*  they haven't ever gotten outside of their bubble, Sean. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=267.24s)]
*  No one really believes that three-year-olds should be able to get gender-affirming care [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=270.14s)]
*  without parental consent, and yet they're all in on these issues. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=273.48s)]
*  No one really thinks that only taking over a couple of buildings by Transilagua, the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=277.28s)]
*  Venezuelan murderous drug gang, is, it's only a couple of buildings, Sean. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  What difference does it make? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=287.32s)]
*  They're taking these positions, and they keep doing it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=289.32s)]
*  It's actually glorious to watch, because it means we don't just have this next four years [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=292.68s)]
*  to do it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=296.64s)]
*  We'll likely have a 12-year runway with incredible candidates. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=297.64s)]
*  The other great thing about the last four years is Republicans and conservatives and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=301.0s)]
*  America First conservatives, in particular, we finally learned to fight, Sean. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=304.48s)]
*  It's the first time where we're actually on the offense. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=308.7s)]
*  We're not just playing defense anymore. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=312.16s)]
*  They're the ones playing defense, and they're in total panic. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=314.48s)]
*  Even some of the great sort of Democrat thought leaders are like, you guys got to stop doing [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=318.20000000000005s)]
*  this, but they can't help themselves. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=322.36s)]
*  Each and every day, they're going all in on insanity. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=324.6s)]
*  I remember in the days after the election, people were like, who cares if you can't [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  afford your groceries? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  We need to go in on XYZ issue that's totally not popular. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  Men playing women's sports, whatever it may be, they just can't help themselves. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=338.86s)]
*  It's really interesting to watch the attacks that they're putting on towards Elon. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=345.1s)]
*  Is he really pro-South Africa? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=349.42s)]
*  Because he's only been a citizen for 22 years. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=351.18s)]
*  Imagine we said that, Sean. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=355.46000000000004s)]
*  It would be a very different response. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  They're getting their own arguments confused. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=358.86s)]
*  They don't know where they're at. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=360.90000000000003s)]
*  They can't keep up with the narrative. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  The administration now is functioning so effectively and so efficiently that by the time the liberal [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=364.54s)]
*  media gets their narrative talking points in line, the administration is three or four [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=370.90000000000003s)]
*  issues down the road. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=375.86s)]
*  They can never catch up. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=377.06s)]
*  It's glorious to watch, and they continue to self-destruct. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=381.26s)]
*  Have you ever given thought to a political future? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=383.3s)]
*  I don't think I've asked you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=387.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=388.82000000000005s)]
*  My goal, I've spent the last nine years in this game. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=391.94s)]
*  I've learned a lot. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=395.09999999999997s)]
*  They continue to run the same playbook at me. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=396.82s)]
*  Yesterday, I was pro-Russia, the usual Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=398.74s)]
*  Here we go again. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=401.78s)]
*  It's like take 12. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=402.78s)]
*  They're back in that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=403.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7U11mPJYs&t=404.78s)]
