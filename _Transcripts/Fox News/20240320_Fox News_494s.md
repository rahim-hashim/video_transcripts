# Vivek Ramaswamy: Americans know they have been lied to
**Fox News:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs)
*  Here with reaction, former presidential candidate himself, Vivek Ramaswamy, is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=0.0s)]
*  So I've said this after the State of the Union address, and I've been pointing this [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=5.0s)]
*  out, and it's becoming more evident every day. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=8.38s)]
*  Joe Biden needs to shore up his base. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=11.08s)]
*  That is not a problem that Donald Trump seems to be having. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=13.6s)]
*  They're coming out in droves for Donald Trump. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=16.68s)]
*  Now, that also, in my mind, well, that's an opportunity for Donald Trump, because now [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=19.56s)]
*  he has an opportunity to say, OK, this is what I did in the four years I was president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=25.44s)]
*  How are things working out under Joe Biden? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=31.28s)]
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=33.56s)]
*  Don't listen to the demagoguery of the left. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  How are your families doing? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=40.2s)]
*  Do you feel safe and secure? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=41.2s)]
*  How are your schools doing? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=42.52s)]
*  How are things when you go to the grocery store? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Basic things. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  Well, look, this is the first time in over a century that American voters have had this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  opportunity to compare two four-year back-to-back records. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  You have four years of Biden, four years of Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=58.0s)]
*  Vote accordingly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=60.64s)]
*  Which one actually served you better? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=61.64s)]
*  And that should spell a landslide election. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  I think that's possible this year, Sean, in a way we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=65.92s)]
*  in 1980 and in 1984. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=69.8s)]
*  That's the opportunity that Donald Trump has and I believe will deliver this year, which [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=72.36s)]
*  will unite this country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=76.4s)]
*  And you talked about the black and Hispanic voters swinging in Trump's direction. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=77.6s)]
*  That makes a lot of sense because just like voters of any skin color, people understand [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=82.0s)]
*  over four years of Biden, prices are up, but wages have remained flat. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=86.82s)]
*  Over four years of Biden, we have open border policies that don't please Hispanic Americans [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=90.68s)]
*  or black Americans. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=95.76s)]
*  They're every bit as badly affected by that open southern border as every other American [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=97.08s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=101.34s)]
*  So this is the opportunity, I think, of a generation for the Republican Party to stand [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=102.38s)]
*  for our shared national values. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=106.48s)]
*  And that's the opportunity that I think Donald Trump is going to deliver on this November [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=108.6s)]
*  and dare I say it, reunite this country. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  And that's what I'm rooting for. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=115.22s)]
*  Isn't that why they have to take out of context something like the bloodbath comment? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  It was clear the president was talking about the automobile industry. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=123.08s)]
*  There's no ambiguity at all if anybody has an ounce of intellectual honesty in them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=126.0s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=131.16s)]
*  But that's what the, that's what they want to talk about. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=132.16s)]
*  They will demagogue abortion. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=135.28s)]
*  That's what they want to talk about. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=137.16s)]
*  They'll, they'll January 6th the country to death, democracy in peril while they themselves [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  try to allow Democratic officials to kick people off the ballot for something they've [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=145.0s)]
*  never been accused of, let alone convicted of. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=151.6s)]
*  So to me, the one thing they don't want to talk about is, are you better off than [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=154.52s)]
*  you are four years ago? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=159.72s)]
*  Because there's no good answer for them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=161.36s)]
*  Well, it's up to us to talk about it instead then, Sean, but I'll tell you this about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=164.2s)]
*  the mainstream media. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  People in this country understand that they have been lied to. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=169.2s)]
*  Back in 2016 and in 2020 it was a different story. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=172.6s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  Fool me once, shame on you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=176.11999999999998s)]
*  Fool me twice, shame on me. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=177.72s)]
*  That's what most Americans know. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=179.64s)]
*  And I think now more than ever there's an opportunity for those in the mainstream left-wing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  media if just one of them had the courage to look their audience in the eye and just [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=184.64s)]
*  tell them at home, we lied to you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  We're sorry about it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=191.88s)]
*  Here's how we're going to change that about the truth of what really happened, about the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=193.08s)]
*  Russia collusion hoax that never was, the origin of COVID-19 that we lied beyond, the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=196.44000000000003s)]
*  Hunter Biden laptop on the eve of the last election. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  We systematically lied to you and we apologize for it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=203.08s)]
*  Yet not one of them has done it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=206.68s)]
*  And if they do, I think that whether it's the New York Times or MSNBC or any other institution, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  it will rebuild trust in this country. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=213.88000000000002s)]
*  But I'm not holding my breath for that, Sean. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=216.34s)]
*  And so yes, it's up to us to speak the truth, speak it unapologetically. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  People across this country, black or white, man or woman, and even Democrat or Republican, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  are starving for that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=227.64s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump and our America First movement is going to deliver. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=229.4s)]
*  And I think that's how we're going to unite this country and get our country back. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=232.76s)]
*  If there's one advantage I would argue that Democrats have heading into this election, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=236.7s)]
*  and I give a lot of credit to Laura Trump and what she has said on this program and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=242.56s)]
*  what her, where she is going to focus a lot of her energy. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=246.56s)]
*  It's going to be on partisan observers, especially in key swing states, in every precinct, watching [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=250.44s)]
*  voting all day, vote counting all night. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=257.36s)]
*  They're focusing their efforts on getting Republicans and conservatives over the reluctance, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=260.16s)]
*  the resistance to vote early and vote by mail. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=265.8s)]
*  And they're also finally going to start an effort of legal ballot harvesting that the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=269.44s)]
*  Democratic Party, I mean, they've run rings around the Republican Party on this one issue [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=274.32s)]
*  alone, which I think gives them a huge advantage. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=279.32s)]
*  If it comes down to another year where maybe six, seven states and a couple of hundred [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=282.96s)]
*  thousand votes will make all the difference, that is a big deal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=288.84s)]
*  Do you have confidence that they'll be able to pull that off in the short time they have? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=292.48s)]
*  I have confidence that whatever is necessary is possible, and it is indeed necessary. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=298.76s)]
*  And every conservative who's at home, I'm with you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=303.65999999999997s)]
*  I want and we will get to single day voting on election day as a national holiday with [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  paper ballots, government ID, English as the sole language that appears on a ballot. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=311.2s)]
*  We will get there. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=316.2s)]
*  But in order to get there, we have to win elections first. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=317.56s)]
*  And that means playing within the rules that are given to the fullest extent possible. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=320.0s)]
*  That's what we need to do. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=324.2s)]
*  And so we got to separate those two questions, Sean. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=325.2s)]
*  We know what the true destination is, true election integrity, true actual national unity [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=327.12s)]
*  with election day as a single voting day. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=331.44s)]
*  But until we get there, we have to play by the rules as they exist to compete and win. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=333.78s)]
*  And let's be honest, it's been a little while since we as a Republican Party have managed [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  to do that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=341.67999999999995s)]
*  I think the new leadership is so far doing a great job. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=342.67999999999995s)]
*  And I think we need to go further in that direction to compete and win to get to the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=345.17999999999995s)]
*  promised land. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=349.46s)]
*  And I think we're going to do both of those things this time around. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=350.61999999999995s)]
*  I think if I were to offer one piece of advice to just objectively, if to Biden, I would [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=353.73999999999995s)]
*  say get out of the race. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=358.73999999999995s)]
*  You're not ready to go another four years. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=360.02s)]
*  I would say, look at these poll numbers. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=362.54s)]
*  Look at the demographics of the Democratic Party. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=366.06s)]
*  Their base is eroding. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  That is an opportunity. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  And I would go out of my way to go into areas of the country where maybe Republicans have [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=372.46000000000004s)]
*  kind of given up on and say, will you please take a look at us? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=379.5s)]
*  Will you please look at what our plans are? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  Will you please look at how bad things are under Joe Biden? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=384.70000000000005s)]
*  And we can do so much better. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  What would you tell? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=390.5s)]
*  What would you tell both candidates? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=391.58s)]
*  Look, I think that that second piece of advice is outstanding. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=394.58s)]
*  This should be a multi-ethnic working class coalition that completely remixes what the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=397.66s)]
*  pundits think that Republican versus Democrat Party really is. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=402.02s)]
*  I can tell you first personally, Sean, I plan to spend time in inner cities in swing states [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=405.94s)]
*  for the remainder of this year. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=409.94s)]
*  And I think many other Republicans will and should join me in doing so. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=411.14s)]
*  And I have full confidence that Donald Trump above all will be reaching those people from [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=414.62s)]
*  rural communities to the inner cities. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=418.42s)]
*  And now, as it comes to your advice for Joe Biden, my concern is he might actually just [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=422.02s)]
*  follow your advice. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=425.06s)]
*  And it may not be even Joe Biden that we're actually running against. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=426.34s)]
*  But regardless of which puppet the Democrats put up, if we stand for our own values, say [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=429.26s)]
*  this is who we are as Republicans, as conservatives, as Americans, these are the values that unite [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=434.26s)]
*  us, show up in the inner city to farm communities across this country, then it doesn't matter [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=439.38s)]
*  who they put up. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=444.06s)]
*  We still have an ability to win decisively in a landslide. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=445.24s)]
*  And I think that's what it's going to take to get this country back. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=449.1s)]
*  And I have full confidence that Donald Trump will be the man to deliver that this November. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=451.82000000000005s)]
*  And I'm going to do everything I can to make sure traveling this country and whatever it [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=455.56s)]
*  takes, as every Republican leader should. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=458.66s)]
*  This is our moment to do it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=461.3s)]
*  It's our 1776 moment in this country. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=462.54s)]
*  And just as our founding fathers made that sacrifice 250 years ago, we don't want to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=465.18s)]
*  see Alexander Hamilton and George Washington. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=469.3s)]
*  They ask us, what did you do for your country? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=471.66s)]
*  We better have a darn good answer. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=473.94s)]
*  And this is our year to deliver it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=475.74s)]
*  All right, Vivek Ramaswamy, inspiring message. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=478.74s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOVGNLncyAs&t=481.42s)]
