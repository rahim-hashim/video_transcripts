# Hurricane Helene survivors speak after devastation: 'It turned ugly quick'
**Fox News:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak)
*  All right, as Florida is bracing for Hurricane Milton in multiple states, they are still [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=0.0s)]
*  trying to recover from Hurricane Helene, the deadly storm absolutely devastating mountain [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=5.24s)]
*  communities in western North Carolina, especially historic flooding. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=10.48s)]
*  I mean, entire towns have been wiped out. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=15.16s)]
*  Our very own Sarah Carter has been there numerous times now, on the ground, in North Carolina, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  in these areas that have been so hard hit and affected. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=24.04s)]
*  And she joins us tonight with five local residents who have had their lives upended by Hurricane Helene. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=27.78s)]
*  Sarah, I justâ€”you can introduce everybody, and I just really have one question. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=33.34s)]
*  I want them to respond to the president saying every need has been met, everybody is happy, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  and are they happy with Joe and Kamala's response to the hurricane? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=46.14s)]
*  What do the states in the storm zone need, Mr. President? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=50.74s)]
*  What do the states in the storm zone, what do they need, what you saw today? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=56.7s)]
*  Oh, in the storm zone? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=61.7s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=63.7s)]
*  I'm wondering what storm they're talking about. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=64.7s)]
*  They're getting everything they need, and they're very happy across the board. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=67.7s)]
*  Sean, I got to tell you, I'm here in Swannanoa. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=75.7s)]
*  You can see the devastation behind me. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=78.18s)]
*  I just heard what President Biden said, and I can tell you this, I'm not going to tell [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=80.06s)]
*  you in my own words. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to let them tell you for themselves the response from the federal government. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=85.3s)]
*  But we had an opportunity today. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  We actually flew over Chimney Rock, Lake Lure, completely devastated. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=91.82s)]
*  I don't even know if there's a word to describe what I witnessed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=98.82s)]
*  It's nothing short of tragic. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=103.82s)]
*  People lost their lives. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=106.3s)]
*  Their homes went down the river. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=107.86s)]
*  It was actually so devastating that there was a geological shift in the river. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=109.5s)]
*  So where the river had actually been at one point, it actually shifted to another area [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=115.7s)]
*  within the community. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=120.3s)]
*  So an entire golf course was gone, a mini golf, restaurants toppled over, the streets [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=122.06s)]
*  were covered with debris. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=127.94s)]
*  But there was one thing that was certain and one thing that I saw. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=129.56s)]
*  It was residents. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=132.8s)]
*  It was firefighters. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=134.04s)]
*  It was law enforcement. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=135.38s)]
*  It was the sheriffs. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=136.66s)]
*  It was people coming out, helping one another. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=137.92s)]
*  And here are some of those people right here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=141.1s)]
*  They came with us because they want the American people, Sean, to know the truth. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  I've got Newland Mayor here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  It's Derek Roberts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=149.06s)]
*  I've got the coroner from Avery County who is with me, John Millen. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=150.06s)]
*  I've got David Calder, real estate, a real estate executive who lost his business. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=155.22s)]
*  Your home. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=161.62s)]
*  I'll go back to you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=162.62s)]
*  I was able to see your business from the helicopter. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=163.62s)]
*  It was completely demolished and sitting in the river. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=165.94s)]
*  And Jimmy Sizemore, my gosh, you lost your entire home. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=170.02s)]
*  It came right off the cliff, Sean, his entire home, his life's investment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=174.9s)]
*  It was out of the flood zone, came right off the cliff. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=180.74s)]
*  I want to start first right here with Derek, Mayor Roberts. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=182.98s)]
*  Talk a little bit about how you and your family experienced that night when Hurricane Helene [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=187.82s)]
*  came in. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=194.3s)]
*  I know you were with your daughter, you were with your children. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=195.3s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=197.66s)]
*  Yeah, it turned ugly quick. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=198.9s)]
*  It went from some rain and some wind to a tree in our bedroom and our basement was flooding. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=202.34s)]
*  And my wife grabbing our daughter Tatum and our grandkids and Isaac and they took off. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  I got on phone with USA right away, right in the middle of it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=216.26s)]
*  It was just awful. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=220.94s)]
*  It was just shocking. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=221.94s)]
*  Let me ask you this before we go on to you, John. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=223.94s)]
*  Did you get in touch with FEMA right away? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=226.86s)]
*  Were there any government officials that you've seen over these days since Hurricane Helene [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=230.66000000000003s)]
*  devastated your home? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=236.9s)]
*  Has anybody been here to help you? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=238.02s)]
*  Because this is the big question. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=239.86s)]
*  Sean just played a clip of President Biden saying that you all are getting everything [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  you need. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  What is FEMA? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=247.94000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=248.94000000000003s)]
*  I mean, literally, what is FEMA? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=249.94000000000003s)]
*  So my daughter, whose house got completely wiped out, she has no flood insurance, meets [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=252.68s)]
*  with a FEMA person, applies for everything she gets, doesn't get the $750 that Kamala [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=256.02s)]
*  says that she's supposed to get, gets approved for $300 for personal items. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=260.82s)]
*  What is that going to do? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=265.94s)]
*  That's literally what she got. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=267.2s)]
*  Her entire first floor is wiped out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=268.2s)]
*  We hauled everything off. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=270.74s)]
*  It's gone. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=272.29999999999995s)]
*  So what is FEMA? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=273.29999999999995s)]
*  And being the mayor. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=274.29999999999995s)]
*  So they didn't even give her the full $750. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=275.29999999999995s)]
*  They didn't even give her $750. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=276.29999999999995s)]
*  Denied the $750. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=277.29999999999995s)]
*  They gave her $300. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=278.29999999999995s)]
*  They gave her $300. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=279.29999999999995s)]
*  That won't even cover what's in the refrigerator. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=280.29999999999995s)]
*  Sean, you're the coroner in Avery County. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=283.1s)]
*  So you know Sean, he would have the information on the people in his county that have either [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=286.1s)]
*  been missing or that have either been reported dead, unfortunately, due to Hurricane Helene. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=292.66s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about that first? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=298.12s)]
*  Yes, I can. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for having us, Sarah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  As of yesterday, we had reported four confirmed deaths. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  Not a hard figure on missing at this point. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  Avery County is a weekend tourist destination. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  We don't know who may have showed up and is unaccounted for that didn't tell anyone. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=312.18s)]
*  There are areas we're still looking. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=316.74s)]
*  We have urban search and rescue and cadaver dogs and teams from Pennsylvania, New York [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=317.94000000000005s)]
*  City Police and Fire. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=322.62s)]
*  The outpouring of individual agencies and people just coming down and helping us has [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=324.66s)]
*  been wonderful. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=328.66s)]
*  Citizens helping citizens, neighbors helping neighbors is how we've gotten by. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=330.86s)]
*  The initial response was very slow. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=334.32000000000005s)]
*  And I understand that no one could prepare for this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=336.86s)]
*  Your National Guard, retired National Guard, so you understand what response should be. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=339.86s)]
*  Was it what it should be? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=346.36s)]
*  Well, the motto of North Carolina National Guard is give us 24 hours, we'll give you [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=347.36s)]
*  an army. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=350.16s)]
*  I retired from the Guard as an MP, first sergeant, did four disaster missions, retired police [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=351.8s)]
*  chief. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=355.68s)]
*  It was very slow. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=356.68s)]
*  I finally contacted State Senator Warren Daniel, who has been assisting our area. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=357.68s)]
*  We're overlapping legislative districts to get help. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=363.12s)]
*  He finally contacted the National Guard, but he asked me, what do you need? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=365.76s)]
*  We originally had a handful of soldiers in Banner Elk. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=368.64s)]
*  And I said, we need more than a handful. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=371.88s)]
*  We need military police, doctors, nurses, medics, water purification technicians, general [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=373.5s)]
*  soldiers. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=377.8s)]
*  What about FEMA? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=378.8s)]
*  FEMA and engineers and heavy equipment. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=379.8s)]
*  What we're doing in their stead, and some finally did roll in, but we're just getting [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  volunteers coming in with equipment and helping people. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=386.96s)]
*  But what President Biden said, is that the case? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=389.84s)]
*  I'm not certainly not going to call the president United States a liar, but I've seen no evidence [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=393.4s)]
*  that it's functioning the way he's given a glowing recommendation of. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  Sorry, I have a question. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay, Sean. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  Sean has a question. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  Sean? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=404.03999999999996s)]
*  I just want to know, what is their message to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  Because I'm hearing people that have had their lives uprooted. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=410.44s)]
*  There was no help that we saw at all for a full week. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=416.32s)]
*  What would they like, what would they want to tell Kamala Harris, who now clearly wants [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=420.35999999999996s)]
*  to politicize this? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=424.58s)]
*  What message do they have as she goes on, you know, call her daddy, call me daddy, call [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=427.2s)]
*  whatever daddy, Stern and The View and Colbert, and she's not in North Carolina. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=432.12s)]
*  What's their message to her? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  So frustrating. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=440.96s)]
*  And I'll go to you, David, for this question from Sean. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=441.96s)]
*  You know, what would your message be to Vice President Kamala Harris and to the White House? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=445.12s)]
*  What do you have to say to them? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, she's she spent time on, you know, these shows, podcasts. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=451.92s)]
*  You haven't seen the response. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=457.88s)]
*  I know I've been up to chimney rock. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=459.2s)]
*  I've never seen such devastation in my life. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=461.36s)]
*  It looks like a war zone. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  I know people lost their life up there as well. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=465.32s)]
*  What would your message be to her in the White House? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=467.36s)]
*  Sean would like to know. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=469.04s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=472.36s)]
*  These people have lost their homes, they've lost their businesses, they've lost everything, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=473.48s)]
*  and they need some support. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=479.64s)]
*  They need help. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=481.54s)]
*  And seven hundred and fifty dollars is not much help. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=483.42s)]
*  And some people didn't even get the seven hundred and fifty. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=487.54s)]
*  So there's a lot of people that couldn't even apply for it because, Sean, there's no connectivity [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=490.3s)]
*  up here. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=494.98s)]
*  We can't get connectivity in the mountains unless there's Starlink. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=495.98s)]
*  You have absolutely no connectivity and people can't. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=498.94s)]
*  Jimmy, what is your message to the White House? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=502.46000000000004s)]
*  Sean would like to know. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=504.86s)]
*  You lost your home, you lost everything and the insurance may not cover it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=506.92s)]
*  Yeah, I lost my home. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=510.78s)]
*  My home was still standing. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  It was a little different than the rest of my neighborhood. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=514.1s)]
*  Our neighborhood lost four homes, just washed away and wiped out. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=516.24s)]
*  But my home was on an 80 foot cliff and it was standing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=521.06s)]
*  I have a photo of it standing the next day after the storm. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=525.78s)]
*  There were still winds coming through and everything. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  And later that day it just fell off the cliff. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=532.1s)]
*  I contacted FEMA and they were easy to get a hold of. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=535.9s)]
*  They called me back. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=541.5s)]
*  But while I was talking to FEMA, they told me they'd have to meet me at my property. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=542.76s)]
*  And a lot of them didn't even make their way up to the property. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=549.18s)]
*  No, they haven't been able to access the property. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=551.42s)]
*  But while I was talking to them, I was driving down the road and the FEMA person told me [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=553.9399999999999s)]
*  before I hung up, he said, well, we're categorizing this as a mudslide. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=558.66s)]
*  They haven't even been to my property yet and they've already categorized it to where [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=564.5s)]
*  my insurance won't give me anything. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=568.9s)]
*  Shawn, this is important. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=570.58s)]
*  What's happened for a lot of people is that FEMA has been categorizing before they've [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=571.58s)]
*  even seen it as mudslides. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=575.82s)]
*  So they're not covering, they're saying the Hurricane Helene victims. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=577.82s)]
*  It's a tragedy all the way around. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=583.18s)]
*  Shawn, we're going to be out here all week. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=584.78s)]
*  I can tell you this, the community is what's together on this. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=586.9s)]
*  Community helping community and neighbor helping neighbor. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=591.38s)]
*  And everyone is frustrated with the White House and with FEMA. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=594.9399999999999s)]
*  And for the most part, they feel abandoned. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=599.34s)]
*  Shawn? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=602.22s)]
*  They were abandoned. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=603.58s)]
*  And I donated, I'm urging others to donate, samaritanspurse.org. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=604.74s)]
*  They have done a great job filling that void. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=609.98s)]
*  It has been amazing. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=612.1s)]
*  And please tell all those people there, at this audience, I know I speak for them. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=614.14s)]
*  They're praying for them. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=619.1s)]
*  They are so sorry about their loss and devastation. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=620.3000000000001s)]
*  And Americans will step up. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=623.7s)]
*  Americans will donate. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=625.26s)]
*  If the government won't do it, we will. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=627.1800000000001s)]
*  Sara Carter, thank you. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd4RZrhfak&t=629.66s)]
