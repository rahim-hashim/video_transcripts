# Ron DeSantis: Kamala Harris is trying to ‘politicize the storm’
**Fox News:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo)
*  And this is a Fox News alert Florida is once again bracing for another massive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=0.0s)]
*  storm. Hurricane Milton is currently a category 5 hurricane barreling across [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=5.4s)]
*  the Gulf of Mexico right towards the Florida Peninsula on the east coast of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=10.74s)]
*  Florida and hurricane warnings have been issued for the entire Tampa area. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=15.3s)]
*  Evacuations have been issued. It has a population of 3.3 million people along [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=19.96s)]
*  with neighboring metros of Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Sarasota, even inland [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=25.96s)]
*  Orlando where another 3 million people live. This is a fast evolving extremely [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  dangerous situation. They're especially worried about swells of up to 20 feet [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=36.46s)]
*  but the state of Florida as usual is well prepared. Now you can't say the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=41.28s)]
*  same about Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. Now they have been MIA in Florida, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee but especially in North Carolina. Now today [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Kamala tried to insinuate that Governor DeSantis does not want federal help. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=55.08s)]
*  Well Governor DeSantis said he didn't even know she called. That is according [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=59.6s)]
*  to Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas. FEMA, he's saying they're [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=63.56s)]
*  bankrupt. According to FEMA's own website over a billion dollars went to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=68.52s)]
*  Harris, Biden, unvetted illegal immigrants and this week she is focused on fawning [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=73.08s)]
*  interviews as I've been telling you with the Call Me Daddy podcast, Stephen Colbert, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=78.8s)]
*  Howard Stern and the ladies of The View instead of being in North Carolina [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=83.52s)]
*  which she and Joe abandoned. It is the worst hurricane to hit the southeast [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  since Katrina and they have been missing in action. They haven't lifted a finger [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=92.36s)]
*  to help and now suddenly she's pretending to care and says this, take a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=96.36s)]
*  look. NBC is reporting Governor DeSantis is ignoring your calls on hurricanes, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  resources and help. How does that hurt the situation here? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  You know moments of crisis, if nothing else, should really be the moment that anyone who calls [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=113.56s)]
*  themselves a leader says they're gonna put politics aside, put the people first. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=120.24s)]
*  People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=125.0s)]
*  at this moment in these crisis situations. These are the height of emergency [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  situations. It's just utterly irretrievable and it is selfish and it is about [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=134.64s)]
*  political gamesmanship instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=140.08s)]
*  Make no mistake, Hurricane Helene is Kamala's Katrina. Joining us now, Florida [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=146.08s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis is with us on the latest on preparation. Alright, I saw the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=153.32s)]
*  statement from your office, number one, you did not hear about a call from Kamala. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  You would have taken the call, you said. I had you on my radio and TV show before [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=161.8s)]
*  Helene hit. You told me, and I had Governor Kemp on, and he told me in your case, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  you had 30,000 utility trucks staged to go in right after the hurricane. You had [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=172.12s)]
*  food, water, medicine, supplies ready to go right in behind the hurricane as [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=178.12s)]
*  usual. I'm assuming you have the same thing for Milton. Am I wrong, Governor? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=184.04s)]
*  No, you're right and Hurricane Helene was a category four storm. It did [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=190.28s)]
*  significant damage to the state of Florida. We've been on this footing now [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=194.96s)]
*  for two weeks straight in terms of preparation response and now we have an [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=198.6s)]
*  even bigger storm that's bearing down, as you pointed out, on a very populated [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=203.32s)]
*  area, potentially could do even more damage and we've been laser focused on [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=208.12s)]
*  leveraging all resources available, including from the federal government, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=212.36s)]
*  and I've been in touch with both FEMA and the president, as well as marshaling [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=216.08s)]
*  all our state agencies and working to support our local communities and so for [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=219.8s)]
*  Kamala Harris to try to say that my sole focus on the people of Florida is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=224.72s)]
*  somehow selfish is delusional. She has no role in this. In fact, she's been vice [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=230.52s)]
*  president for three and a half years. I've dealt with a number of storms under [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=237.48s)]
*  this administration. She has never contributed anything to any of these [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=241.32s)]
*  efforts and so what I think is selfish is her trying to blunder into this. No, and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=245.92s)]
*  here's the thing. She has no role. No, she has no role in this process. I'm in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=251.96s)]
*  contact with the president of the United States. I'm in contact with FEMA director. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=258.32s)]
*  I'm obviously managing all our state agencies. We're supporting all our local [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=262.16s)]
*  government and I will say this. I've had storms under both President Trump and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=266.76s)]
*  President Biden and I've worked well with both of them. She's the first one [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=270.48s)]
*  who's trying to politicize the storm and she's doing that just because of her [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=274.76s)]
*  campaign. She's trying to get some type of an edge. She knows she's doing [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=280.72s)]
*  poorly and so she's playing these political games. I don't have time for [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=284.92s)]
*  political games. I've got people's whose lives are on the line. I've got people's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=288.24s)]
*  whose homes and their possessions are on the line and we are focused 100% on that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=292.56s)]
*  mission. I'm not worried about playing her political games and so she is being [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  selfish by trying to blunder into this when we're working just fine. You know, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  you had properly staged. You are ready for Milton. You have all the utility [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=310.64s)]
*  trucks. You have food. You have water. You have supplies. All staged. All ready to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  come in right behind the hurricane as you always do. Governor Kemp, same thing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=321.4s)]
*  Governor McMaster, same thing. They have been missing in action. It took FEMA [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=325.68s)]
*  nearly an entire week to get to the people in North Carolina and we still [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=330.84s)]
*  don't know the death count in North Carolina. It is the worst, to me, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=334.56s)]
*  response ever in the history of hurricanes in this country, Governor, and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=340.04s)]
*  for her to be going on a, you know, stern, cold bear, the view, call me daddy, instead [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=344.4s)]
*  of being in North Carolina is unconscionable. Well, I'll tell you this, Sean. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=351.2s)]
*  We're gonna handle this incoming storm. It is right now much more powerful than [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=356.48s)]
*  what Helene was and we'll see. They say it's gonna weaken before it hits but we [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=362.24s)]
*  can't assume that. So this has the potential to be one of the most damaging [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=365.84s)]
*  storms in the history of our country. And can we not just focus on the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=370.2s)]
*  livelihoods and the well-being of the people? Why is she trying to politicize [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=374.67999999999995s)]
*  this? Why is she putting her campaign ahead of the well-being of the people of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=380.0s)]
*  Florida? We're laser focused on their well-being. This is gonna be a massive [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  effort. There's gonna be things we're gonna have to respond to that we've [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=389.35999999999996s)]
*  probably never had to respond in this kind in the history of our state and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=392.28s)]
*  we're gonna do it and we're gonna keep our eye on the ball and we're not gonna [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=396.96s)]
*  let her nonsense distract us from the task at hand. Governor, as a fellow [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=400.52s)]
*  Floridian, if there's anything I can do to help you, if you need these airwaves, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=406.4s)]
*  you need my radio show, we are on board for anything you need. I am urging people [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  to go to samaritanspurse.org. They're doing some really good work on in all of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=415.23999999999995s)]
*  these southern states and we appreciate you being on governor. We're praying for [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=420.24s)]
*  our state tonight. Thank you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgJxejyfaAo&t=424.68s)]
