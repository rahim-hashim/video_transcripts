# Judge Jeanine: The left had nothing to run on
**Fox News:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk)
*  I'm here with reaction co-host of the hit show The Five, our friend Judge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=0.0s)]
*  Juniu Pirro. You know, it's amazing. You know him well. We have both known him [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=3.44s)]
*  for 30 whatever many years and you know he was joking but he's saying yes day [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=7.2s)]
*  one for one day I'm going to fix the border be energy independent. Every [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=13.76s)]
*  Democrat, Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, Obama, he says he's going to be a dictator. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=18.64s)]
*  They were flat out lying, taking it out of context, but it didn't work. Judge [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=23.52s)]
*  did it. No, it didn't work because the American people are smarter than that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=28.08s)]
*  Look, the left had nothing to run on other than Donald Trump is this horrible [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=32.64s)]
*  human being. He's a Hitler and he's a, you know, he's a fascist. But then when [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=37.04s)]
*  they started coming after the rest of us and said, well, we're MAGA extremists [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=42.96s)]
*  and we're semi-fascists and we're garbage and you know we're deplorable and we [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=47.68s)]
*  cling to God and guns. I do religiously and I'm thrilled. Once the American [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=52.0s)]
*  people saw through that, they knew the president was right when he said, they're [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=57.16s)]
*  really coming for you. I'm just in the way. And what the president has an [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=61.0s)]
*  opportunity to do is exactly what he did in 2016. Sean, I went back and looked at [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  the president's acceptance speech in 2016. Do you know how much time he spent [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=70.84s)]
*  congratulating Hillary Clinton for her years of work for the American people [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=75.8s)]
*  that we owe her a major debt of gratitude? And he went on and on. He never [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=81.88s)]
*  indicted her. He never went after her. That's not who he is. And when the left [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=85.96s)]
*  now is standing up and they're saying, we're going to resist President Trump, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  will you go right ahead and do that, you fools? Because this president won the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=94.6s)]
*  popular vote. He's got a mandate from the Electoral College and this president [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=99.32s)]
*  has an obligation, Sean, to take down those institutions that have been [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=103.96s)]
*  politicized, whether it is the FBI, the intelligence agencies, the CIA. He's got [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=109.16s)]
*  an obligation to return them to the non-political nature that they are [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=115.64s)]
*  supposed to be. And that's what America wants. They don't want retribution. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, President Donald Trump, doesn't do that kind of thing. He wants [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=125.0s)]
*  success. That's why we have Elon Musk. RFK is going to make us healthy again. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=129.96s)]
*  And Tulsi Gabbard. All of these people are about working for Americans. And I [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=135.72s)]
*  am so sick of the left and all their nonsense. And the fact that they're not [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=140.76s)]
*  as self-introspective to realize they lost because they lied. They try to take [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=145.24s)]
*  him down politically, financially, emotionally, and they tried to kill him [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  twice. I don't know who it was. But you know what? Enough. This president has [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  earned the right to run this country the way the American people expect them to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=161.56s)]
*  run it. I can't say it any better, but you're right about one thing. I would [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=166.12s)]
*  like to see the FBI return to its former greatness. I would like American [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  intelligence agencies to be the envy of the world. Not weaponized, not politicized, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=178.84s)]
*  no fake FISA warrants, no 51 intel officials. I want the Department of Justice. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=186.36s)]
*  I would never want what has happened to him abusing power the way they did and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=193.88000000000002s)]
*  weaponizing that department to ever be done to anybody ever again. That will [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=200.12s)]
*  mean that you have to clean out those agencies of these operatives that are [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=204.68s)]
*  political when they have a job to do, which is to uphold the Constitution, the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=209.72s)]
*  rule of law. And that's all he's that that's all I want. You want it. And we [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=214.84s)]
*  know he wants. And my understanding is everyone in the FBI who is above a GS 14 [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=219.56s)]
*  level is scared to death as well. They should be. The FBI should not be going [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=225.32s)]
*  after parents and calling them domestic terrorists. They should not be going [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  after Catholics and pro lifers. Their job is not to indict a president of the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=233.48s)]
*  United States through this crossfire hurricane and lie to courts the way they [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  did with a Jim Comey unverified affidavits. And then you've got the so [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=243.72s)]
*  called intelligence community that lies and calls what is ultimately exhibit one [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  in the United States case against Hunter Biden. They call it Russian [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=254.44s)]
*  disinformation. They lied. We know they lied. And it's time for this president to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=258.52s)]
*  return America back to the institutions that our founding fathers believed in. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=263.56s)]
*  Judge, we'll see you down in Florida often. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSpy0rJ5Hk&t=268.84s)]
