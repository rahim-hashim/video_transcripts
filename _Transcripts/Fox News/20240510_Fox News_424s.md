# Jonathan Turley: This could end up as a reversible error
**Fox News:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM)
*  Here with analysis, Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan, I've been following your commentary very, very closely. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=3.7s)]
*  You've been dead-on accurate about this. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=7.32s)]
*  OK, none of the salacious material or talking to dead people is particularly relevant to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=9.84s)]
*  the law in this case. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=16.92s)]
*  I don't think any of it should have been admissible. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=18.48s)]
*  I do think the moment that Daniels had been claiming, oh, no, it wasn't about the money, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=21.36s)]
*  it was all about safety. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=26.16s)]
*  I kind of got blown out of the water by the tape recording today, but yet the jury is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=27.98s)]
*  hearing all of this, and they've not been hearing about the law, and that concerns me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=33.44s)]
*  Well, it should concern you, although I'm not too sure you're right about the immateriality [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=39.9s)]
*  in a case built on two dead misdemeanors. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=47.42s)]
*  Talking to the dead might be just the skill set you need as a witness. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=50.06s)]
*  This case itself died years ago and was sparked back into life with this bizarre theory, but [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=55.14s)]
*  we still don't even know the full extent of the theory because we don't know what actually [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=62.06s)]
*  is the crime that Trump was supposed to be concealing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=66.74s)]
*  And keep in mind that today's testimony also revealed for the jury another interesting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=70.66s)]
*  contradiction. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  You have all of this discussion of his signing the checks in the White House. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=76.98s)]
*  So it really sort of drove home this theory that he somehow falsely denoted the payments [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=82.42s)]
*  after the election to influence the election. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=90.44s)]
*  So the election was already over, he already won, and he classified them as legal expenses, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=93.78s)]
*  and somehow retroactively that was stealing the election. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=98.84s)]
*  It's that convoluted. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=103.04s)]
*  The problem that I have is not that the jury can't disregard what they've heard, they [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=104.92s)]
*  can't disregard all of it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=112.78s)]
*  I'm sure the judges are coming in and say, please forget you heard some of those details, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=113.78s)]
*  which is not going to happen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=118.14s)]
*  But she lacks such credibility. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  I'm hoping they see that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=122.06s)]
*  The problem is that the judge has already committed, in my view, reversible there before [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=123.66s)]
*  Daniels ever took the stand. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=128.88s)]
*  He allowed the government to repeatedly say that there were campaign violations in this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=130.68s)]
*  case. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=135.66s)]
*  They're all they know that Donald Trump did commit a campaign finance violation, election [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=136.66s)]
*  finance violation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=142.82s)]
*  That's just not true. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=145.3s)]
*  And that itself, I think, could end up a reversible error. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=147.18s)]
*  You know, all right, so the bookkeeping side of this under New York law would be a misdemeanor, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=152.14s)]
*  but a misdemeanor whose statute of limitations have long since passed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=158.18s)]
*  Now, you're a very prestigious law professor, and you're telling me that we're witnessing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  a trial that is taking place against a former president from eight years ago, that you have [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=169.86s)]
*  a judge who donated to his opponent in this upcoming election, whose family may very well [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=176.4s)]
*  be compromised or have family members benefit from this, that being his daughter. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  And then you have the third highest ranking DOJ official, Biden's DOJ, coming over to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=188.46s)]
*  try the case and explain to me, and we don't know what the actual crime they're prosecuting [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=195.10000000000002s)]
*  the former president is, because you happen to beâ€”I've asked this question of many [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  lawyers, and there's not one that can explain it to me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  You're saying we don't know what the crime is? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't somebody have a right to know what they're charged with? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  They do, and the judge has an obligation to bring some clarity, which he should have before [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=220.74s)]
*  this trial began, to say, I need you to state with absolute clarity, what was the fraud? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=226.5s)]
*  What was the effort to conceal what crime? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump did not commit a campaign finance violation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=236.9s)]
*  The Department of Justice chose not to charge it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  The only reason we're here is because Bragg has this bizarre theory that by alleging that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=242.88s)]
*  there was a crime that was being concealed, he can bring back into life a couple of bookkeeping [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=248.72s)]
*  misdemeanors. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=255.28s)]
*  Now, the judge seems perfectly happy to let him just drift along in the hopes that he's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  going to bump into an actual crime. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=263.44s)]
*  From this point so far, that jury has been told that there was a campaign finance violation [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=268.24s)]
*  by the prosecutors, and they're very careful not to explain by whom. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=275.08s)]
*  It was not by Trump. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=279.88s)]
*  It might have been by Pecker, although there's some debate on that, but it certainly was [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  not by Trump. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=286.04s)]
*  He's being tried for something that most of us really don't know the measure of or the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=288.36s)]
*  meaning of. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=292.8s)]
*  That's how bad this has gotten. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=294.6s)]
*  I have never in my career seen a trial like this one. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=295.84s)]
*  And nobody else would have been tried with this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=301.0s)]
*  The fact that they brought the third highest ranking DOJ official over to do all of this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=303.4s)]
*  The question is, will all the smoke and mirrors and opening statements, the prosecution is [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  talking about conspiracy, election fraud, and they're throwing out all of these names, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=315.24s)]
*  but they're not talking about the law or the crime. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=321.56s)]
*  The salacious nature of Stormy's testimony or talking to dead people, how is that relevant [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  to what would be a campaign finance violation? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=332.4s)]
*  And how do you get to a campaign finance violation, which is federal election law, and get to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=336.2s)]
*  bring it into the state of New York? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=341.24s)]
*  Well, it's not relevant. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=344.2s)]
*  And the interesting thing about the first day of Daniel's testimony is that the prosecutors [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  clearly wanted it to roll out that way. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=352.68s)]
*  She was coached by the prosecutors. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  She gave these lurid, disgusting testimony, and that doesn't win their case for them. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  It may be viewed as winning the election, but not the case. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  And so the prosecutors knew that she would be Cuisinarted the next day in cross-examination, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=368.0s)]
*  but they didn't care about that either. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  What they wanted was to get these salacious details out to embarrass, humiliate the former [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=376.88s)]
*  president. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=382.32s)]
*  And you have a judge who just sat there watching this dumpster fire in his courtroom. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  And at the end of the day, I'm hoping that some jurors will be insulted by all of this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=390.4s)]
*  I'm hoping that they will redeem the integrity of the New York system, because so far that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=396.68s)]
*  has not happened. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=401.8s)]
*  All right, Jonathan Turley, thank you for that important commentary. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=403.28s)]
*  Sad times we're living in. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=407.36s)]
*  This is what the weaponization of a Justice Department looks like. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqJNTR_rDM&t=408.48s)]
