# Josh Hawley sounds the alarm on this 'disaster'
**Fox News:** [February 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Biden's border crisis has taken a disturbing new turn [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=2.5s)]
*  as the illegals crossing our border [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=5.94s)]
*  now come from countries far beyond Mexico, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=8.3s)]
*  far beyond Central America. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=11.44s)]
*  Our colleagues Bill Mollusian and Griff Jenkins [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  have been reporting from the border in Hakuba, California, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=16.22s)]
*  about an hour east of San Diego. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=19.62s)]
*  And what they've encountered are migrants from Ecuador, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=22.06s)]
*  Syria, Turkey, China, comforting, right? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=25.32s)]
*  In fact, there has been a shocking rise [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=29.44s)]
*  in the number of illegal crossings from China. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  In fact, sources tell Bill Mollusian that over 20,000, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=35.06s)]
*  20,000 Chinese illegals have crossed the border [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=38.42s)]
*  so far this fiscal year, which began on October 1st. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=41.82s)]
*  Compare that to 2021, the entire fiscal year, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=48.0s)]
*  when just 450 crossed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=50.96s)]
*  That makes for a 4,000% increase in Chinese illegals. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=53.64s)]
*  Here with reaction is Missouri Republican Senator, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=59.339999999999996s)]
*  Josh Hawley. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  Senator Hawley, welcome. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=63.22s)]
*  And what is going on? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=65.42s)]
*  A 4,000% increase in Chinese nationals. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=67.17999999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, it used to be 30 years ago, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=72.46s)]
*  or really just for the last 30 years in total, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=75.4s)]
*  that Wall Street and the liberals [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=77.96s)]
*  and the multinational corporations [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=81.14s)]
*  would send our jobs overseas to China. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=82.56s)]
*  Now, they're actually letting the Chinese nationals [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=84.74s)]
*  come here to the United States [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=87.3s)]
*  and take the jobs right off from under our noses. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=88.74s)]
*  I mean, you talk about 20,000 Chinese nationals [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=90.6s)]
*  just since October coming into this country, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=94.08s)]
*  taking jobs, driving down wages. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=97.04s)]
*  Of course, China's already buying farmland, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  U.S. farmland at a record pace, Kayleigh. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=101.08s)]
*  I mean, this is unbelievable. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=103.18s)]
*  And clearly it shows that the border is completely open. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=105.58s)]
*  Joe Biden wants it open. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=108.16s)]
*  And for American workers, that is a disaster. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  So four and a half months, four and a half months, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=113.2s)]
*  20,000 Chinese nationals. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=115.5s)]
*  I mean, you talk about China buying up U.S. farmland. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  That's happening. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  TikTok infiltrating the minds of our young people. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=121.18s)]
*  That's what China's doing there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=124.42s)]
*  And then not to mention the illegal police stations [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=125.92s)]
*  they have across the world, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=128.66s)]
*  including here in the United States. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=129.76s)]
*  Are these Chinese nationals coming? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=131.76s)]
*  And I get that this is conjecture [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=133.4s)]
*  because the border is porous [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=135.4s)]
*  or could it be something more sinister? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=137.36s)]
*  Well, listen, I mean, we know that China has had a plan [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  to try and infiltrate U.S. campuses. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=143.94s)]
*  I mean, they've set up these Confucius centers [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  all over campuses across the country [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=147.46s)]
*  that were just basically glorified spy stations. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  We know their intentions toward us, Kayleigh, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  are totally ill founded. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=154.74s)]
*  I mean, they are not our friends. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  They are our opponents. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=157.68s)]
*  They are competitors. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=159.24s)]
*  They are our enemies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  And as to TikTok, I mean, as if it isn't bad enough [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  that the Chinese government's using TikTok [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=165.24s)]
*  to spy on every American who has it on their phone. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=167.12s)]
*  Now they're using TikTok to bring thousands [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=169.96s)]
*  of Chinese nationals across the border. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you can actually use TikTok [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=174.28s)]
*  or the Chinese version of TikTok [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=175.98s)]
*  to help get across the border now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=178.12s)]
*  I mean, it is unbelievable. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=179.78s)]
*  And as I say, I mean, if you're a worker in this country, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=182.06s)]
*  my gosh, Joe Biden's open border policies [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=184.66s)]
*  are costing you your job, costing you your security, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=187.26s)]
*  costing your family their safety. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=190.0s)]
*  It's out of control. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=192.2s)]
*  I'm glad you brought up President Joe Biden [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  because the image is happening on our screen, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=195.06s)]
*  not in a vacuum, happening because of the president. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=197.1s)]
*  And Axios is reporting this today. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=200.14s)]
*  I want your thought on this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  They're calling the State of the Union [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=203.8s)]
*  Biden's reset moment. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=205.2s)]
*  And they say one bold move that Biden is considering, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=206.8s)]
*  we're told, is an executive order [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=209.74s)]
*  that would dramatically staunch the record flow of migrants [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=212.1s)]
*  into the Southwest. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=215.62s)]
*  This could even happen in the two weeks before the address, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=216.98s)]
*  allowing Biden to say he took actions [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  while Republicans just talk. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=223.02s)]
*  Will that be enough for the American voter? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=225.82s)]
*  What executive order is he thinking about? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=228.22s)]
*  It won't be enough. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=231.22s)]
*  And listen, he's the reason why the border is open. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  There hasn't been any change in the law [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=234.86s)]
*  from the last president, President Trump, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  to this president. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=238.5s)]
*  The only change has been Joe Biden. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=239.5s)]
*  And I tell you what, Kayleigh, I've had Alejandro Mayorkas, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  Biden's Homeland Security Secretary, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  say to me directly multiple times [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=246.54000000000002s)]
*  that the Biden border policies are working. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=249.54000000000002s)]
*  And that's them telling the truth. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  They are working because they want the border open. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=253.94s)]
*  That's their policy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  This is their policy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=257.58s)]
*  So this is all because of Joe Biden. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=258.74s)]
*  It's 100% on him. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=260.78s)]
*  And he's the one American workers can look to and say, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=262.97999999999996s)]
*  man, you are costing us our jobs. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  You are costing us our security. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=266.88s)]
*  You're costing us our farmland. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=268.44s)]
*  It is on him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  It's on him. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=271.58s)]
*  And it's even spilling to our Northern border. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=272.41999999999996s)]
*  The New York Post is reporting that there are illegal [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=274.68s)]
*  immigrants considering crossing from Mexico City, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  Juarez, wherever in Mexico. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=281.65999999999997s)]
*  And if they have $350, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=283.46s)]
*  they just buy a ticket, a plane ticket to Canada [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  and cross our Northern border [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=289.76s)]
*  where border crossings are up 240%. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=292.0s)]
*  So is it so bad that now we're seeing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=294.46s)]
*  a Northern border problem as well, Senator? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=296.8s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=301.4s)]
*  I mean, it's anywhere that the illegals can get in. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=302.24s)]
*  And we should just be clear about this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=304.4s)]
*  The cartels are in charge here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2myhbGFEE&t=305.96s)]
