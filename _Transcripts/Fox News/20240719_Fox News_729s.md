# Ted Cruz: The Democratic nominee ‘is not Joe Biden’
**Fox News:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40)
*  Joining us now, Senator Ted Cruz, great state of Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=0.0s)]
*  How are you, my friend? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=2.6s)]
*  I don't ever get to see you in person. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=3.6s)]
*  Well, normally I'm talking to a TV camera. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=5.8s)]
*  It's good to be in person and it's even better to be at an amazing convention like this one. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=8.0s)]
*  Let's talk about it and all this talk. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=12.0s)]
*  By the way, Kai's coming for your job. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  She can have it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=16.4s)]
*  She's better than me already, I can tell. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about this convention, your speech last night. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=20.8s)]
*  We're 60 days away from early voting in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=25.6s)]
*  We don't even know who the Democratic candidate fully is. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=29.2s)]
*  Thoughts? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=32.0s)]
*  Look, it is not going to be Joe Biden. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=33.0s)]
*  And as you know... [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=35.2s)]
*  You've been saying that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=36.2s)]
*  Why are you so convinced? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=37.2s)]
*  I predicted that 10 months ago on my podcast Verdict. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=38.2s)]
*  I said 10 months ago... [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=40.8s)]
*  You did? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=42.2s)]
*  ...the Democrats are going to pull Joe Biden off the ticket. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=43.2s)]
*  They're going to replace him with Michelle Obama is what I predicted. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=46.4s)]
*  And at the time that the corporate media went nuts, said I was a moonbat lunatic, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=49.8s)]
*  I think we are days away from Biden being on the ticket. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=55.0s)]
*  By the way, we share that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=57.2s)]
*  I get called the same thing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=58.4s)]
*  My sources are telling me it's 50-50 still. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=61.9s)]
*  They're saying it, the White House is denying it, but more than before, it seems more real. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=65.4s)]
*  Look, I think it is north of 90% right now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=71.0s)]
*  You've got the entire Democrat Party that has come out against him. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=75.0s)]
*  You've got Obama that's come out against him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=78.6s)]
*  You've got Chuck Schumer. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=80.28s)]
*  You've got Pelosi. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=81.28s)]
*  You've got Jeffries. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=82.28s)]
*  You've got the donors. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=83.28s)]
*  You've got the corporate media. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=84.28s)]
*  You've got Hollywood. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=85.28s)]
*  Like everyone as a raid against him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=86.72s)]
*  And listen, think about how Nixon stepped down. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=89.72s)]
*  He stepped down because a handful of old bulls from the Senate... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=92.32s)]
*  Like Barry Goldwater. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=95.92s)]
*  ...went to the Oval. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=96.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=98.72s)]
*  And they didn't do so gently. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=99.72s)]
*  They said either you step down or the House will impeach you and will convict you and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=100.72s)]
*  remove you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=105.42s)]
*  At the end of the day, the hammer the Democrats have if they want to use it is the 25th Amendment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=106.42s)]
*  And the 25th Amendment takes the Vice President and half the capitol. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=111.92s)]
*  So explain this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=114.72s)]
*  So he's not qualified to run, but he's qualified to be president now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=115.72s)]
*  And by the way, they were surprised that he's a cognitive mess. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=120.12s)]
*  Senator, I don't think anybody in the country ran those tapes of Joe more than yours truly. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=123.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=129.32s)]
*  Look, everyone who was paying attention knew a year ago, two years ago, three years ago [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=130.32s)]
*  that Biden's mental capabilities had diminished. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=135.92s)]
*  You're right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=139.24s)]
*  No Democrat cared. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=140.24s)]
*  They didn't care until they believed he was going to lose. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=141.24s)]
*  So have you heard a single Democrat say the man is demented, he's not competent to tie [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=144.36s)]
*  his shoes, but he shouldn't be commander in chief right now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, listen, there comes a time where you take the keys away from grandpa. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  In this case, those keys are attached to ICBMs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  By the way, a frightening thought. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=160.8s)]
*  We're going to bring in a fellow senator. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  They're okay with you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=164.96s)]
*  I think you guys are friends. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=165.96s)]
*  You've got the Cuban caucus right here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=167.52s)]
*  Oh, geez. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=169.16000000000003s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  By the way, three is a conspiracy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=171.96s)]
*  Now, he was supposed to be on last night, but he ditched me to be in the box with President [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=173.76s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=178.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=179.76s)]
*  How should I take that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=180.76s)]
*  You're my senator. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=181.76s)]
*  I know, but he's the president from Florida too as well. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=182.76s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=184.32s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  I thought you gave a very great, gracious speech. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  You are the finalist really from all my sources. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=190.04s)]
*  What was that like for you? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=195.2s)]
*  It was great. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=196.34s)]
*  And I got to know President Trump even deeper. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=197.34s)]
*  I worked with him closely when he was president. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=200.04s)]
*  It was great. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=204.24s)]
*  But he had a lot of really good choices. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=205.24s)]
*  JD is going to be really, really good. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=206.24s)]
*  I think people got a glimpse of it last night. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=208.2s)]
*  I've known him now for about six years. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=210.0s)]
*  Started really interacting with him in 2018. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=212.6s)]
*  Actually helped us with some policy stuff. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  And then he's gone to the Senate. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  Ted will tell you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  He's one of the smartest people around. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  Right after Ted Cruz. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=220.96s)]
*  He's the second smartest guy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=221.96s)]
*  You know Alan Dershowitz says that he was, in all the years that he was a professor at [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=224.24s)]
*  Harvard, that this guy was his best student. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=228.96s)]
*  And you guys don't agree on much. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=232.6s)]
*  We don't. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=234.88s)]
*  But Dershowitz is an amazing professor. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=235.88s)]
*  And I'll tell you, like millions of Americans, Joe Biden is driving him away from the Democrat [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=237.96s)]
*  Party because they've gotten so radical. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=243.12s)]
*  When they're too far left for Alan Dershowitz, that tells you they've really gone off the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  cliff. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  There's so much at stake here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  You see, regardless of what happens to Joe, I make the point that policy-wise, everything [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=255.8s)]
*  is going to remain the same. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  Policies on open borders are not going to change. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=263.92s)]
*  I think the biggest national security threat we have. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=266.12s)]
*  Economic policy is not going to change. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=269.64s)]
*  Energy policy is not going to change. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=272.48s)]
*  The issue of law and order and safety and security, you know, defund dismantle, no bail, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=275.04s)]
*  that's not going to change. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=280.88s)]
*  The Democratic Party universally does not believe America should be the most dominant [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=282.24s)]
*  force on the world stage, or they think we're imperialist. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=288.8s)]
*  Well, you know, I think it's one of the reasons why for three and a half years they literally [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  had a conspiracy of silence to cover up his decline. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=297.88s)]
*  Because if you're a radical left-wing activist, Joe Biden's perfect career politician, 50-something [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=300.68s)]
*  years, generally been a centrist for most of his career in the old Democratic Party. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=306.48s)]
*  And he's just a figurehead, and they hide behind him and they implement all these policies [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=311.16s)]
*  until they couldn't cover it up anymore one night in a debate, but the rest of us could [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  see it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=318.0s)]
*  So now they're in a real bind. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=319.0s)]
*  I think you make a great point. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=320.0s)]
*  If he's not, if he doesn't have the mental acuity to be a candidate, how can he continue [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=321.68s)]
*  to be the president? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=325.6s)]
*  Because president's a lot harder than candidate. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=326.6s)]
*  And so they're in a mess. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=328.88s)]
*  And it's going to be Kamala Harris, and she's a legitimate left-winger. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=329.88s)]
*  You may have to debate your fellow Republican senator here. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=333.04s)]
*  He thinks Michelle Obama. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=336.32s)]
*  So I actually think it's a coin flip. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=337.92s)]
*  I think it's a coin flip now between Michelle Obama and Kamala. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=339.48s)]
*  Look, if I were a Democrat, I'd want Michelle Obama as a Republican. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=342.76s)]
*  She's by far the scariest nominee. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=346.84s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=349.6s)]
*  The Democrats are circling the wagons around Kamala. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=350.6s)]
*  I think it's about 50-50 between the two of them. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=353.64s)]
*  I think it's about 90-10. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  I think it's Kamala. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=357.96s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=358.96s)]
*  Well, I think it's hard. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=359.96s)]
*  If she's your vice president, that means you think she could be president, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=360.96s)]
*  How do you move her out of the way? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=363.8s)]
*  But look, I don't have deep insights into the DNC. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=366.28s)]
*  But how undemocratic they like to talk about democracy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=369.48s)]
*  This is basically an interparty coup. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=372.76s)]
*  Five or six good party leaders. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=374.44s)]
*  I've been using that word. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=375.96s)]
*  Right, coup. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=376.96s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=377.96s)]
*  I mean, they're basically telling this guy, you got to go. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=378.96s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  The voters picked you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  We're going to remove you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  We're going to cut off your money. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I've never seen anything like it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  It has no precedent in American politics. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=385.92s)]
*  It has no precedent at all. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  And again, 60 days outside of early voting in Pennsylvania, and then it rolls out around [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=389.48s)]
*  the country. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  I haven't spoken to either one of you about the issue of this assassination attempt. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=396.08s)]
*  And I am angry. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=401.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=403.72s)]
*  Angry at the failure of the Secret Service. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=404.72s)]
*  I really am. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=407.36s)]
*  The idea 130 feet away, that's a two foot putt, that's a layup in basketball. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=408.68s)]
*  And they knew this guy was a suspect at the time. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=414.88s)]
*  They had been following him. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=418.36s)]
*  They lost him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=419.52s)]
*  One, why did they let Trump go out and speak? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  They should have kept him in protective custody. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=423.44s)]
*  Two, when the Secret Service director, and by the way, will somebody please tell Joe [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=426.88s)]
*  Biden it's a her, not a him? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  That was a bad mistake. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  When she said, I bear all responsibility, buck stops with me, but I'm not quitting. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=436.67999999999995s)]
*  And then said, well, it was a slow group. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  Why didn't you have sniper eyes on that group? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=444.23999999999995s)]
*  And then we put them inside. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=446.84s)]
*  Why didn't you surround the perimeter knowing and acknowledging that it was a threat? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  Look, it was an absolutely catastrophic security failure. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=453.12s)]
*  And I believe if the director of the Secret Service had a shred of integrity, she would [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  have resigned that day. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  And if Joe Biden or anyone in the White House had any sense, they should fire her. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  She should be fired. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  I've joined with a number of other senators demanding emergency hearings in the Senate [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=469.67999999999995s)]
*  Judiciary Committee next week with her there with the head of the FBI. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  And you know, Marco and I were both yesterday on a briefing with all 100 senators and the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=478.2s)]
*  director of the Secret Service, the head of the FBI. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=483.84s)]
*  It was a complete CYA. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=486.8s)]
*  They spoke for 30 minutes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=488.88s)]
*  They talked about every detail of the day. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=490.6s)]
*  Well, we were in the field. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=492.76s)]
*  We were preparing this. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=493.92s)]
*  We were doing this. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=494.92s)]
*  Everything except the detail that they allowed the president of the United States to be shot. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=495.92s)]
*  And then they had a couple of questions, but they cut off the questions quickly. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=500.6s)]
*  And there are a whole bunch of questions she needs to ask. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=504.76s)]
*  She needs to be fired and fired immediately. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  I think all three of us agree with that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=509.0s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=510.64s)]
*  Let's get your thoughts on this. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=511.64s)]
*  How can this happen in this day and age? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=513.52s)]
*  I can tell you, look, there is no way in the world that there should be a 20-year-old kid. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=515.88s)]
*  This is not Jason Bourne. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=521.4s)]
*  OK, we're not talking about some secret agent here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=522.4s)]
*  Some 20-year-old kid climbs on top of a roof 150 yards away and takes a shot. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=524.36s)]
*  And he was identified hours earlier. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=529.08s)]
*  Now, they can blame it all they want and other agencies that were there. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  The responsibility of securing the perimeter in that event is the Secret Service. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm not talking about the guys. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=538.52s)]
*  You know some of these guys that are with Trump. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  By the way, the guys that protected the president on the stage, they were phenomenal. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=541.7199999999999s)]
*  They're heroes. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=545.64s)]
*  The agents themselves, they put their bodies in harm's way. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=546.64s)]
*  It's the political leadership that failed. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=549.3199999999999s)]
*  And that event was poorly advanced in terms of security. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=551.52s)]
*  And I want to know, is this a one-off or is this becoming a systemic problem within the agency? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=554.92s)]
*  Look, the Secret Service doesn't just protect the lives of presidents and vice presidents [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=560.16s)]
*  and candidates. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=563.64s)]
*  They protect our country. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=564.64s)]
*  Where would we be tonight if that thing at horror finally ended in the live execution [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=566.0s)]
*  of the next president of the United States in front of the eyes of the world? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=571.28s)]
*  Where would this country be tonight? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=574.44s)]
*  We would be in a catastrophic situation. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=575.88s)]
*  They also protect our country. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=578.08s)]
*  The leadership of that agency has failed us. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=579.72s)]
*  And why aren't they having daily press briefings providing as many details as possible? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=581.96s)]
*  Well, how is it that when we have a school shooting, almost within hours, we know a lot [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=586.6s)]
*  about the shooter? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=592.48s)]
*  And how is it in this case? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=594.08s)]
*  This happened on Saturday. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=595.6s)]
*  It is now Thursday. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=596.6s)]
*  We know little to nothing really about the person. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=598.2s)]
*  And on top of it, and this is your wheelhouse, Iran had issued an assassination order against [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, what, weeks earlier? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=608.72s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not new. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, they've gone after, they want him, Pompeo, there's a bunch of people that they [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=612.0s)]
*  threatened. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=615.04s)]
*  But here's why it's relevant. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=616.04s)]
*  There's no evidence that this is the guy that they would have hired. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=617.04s)]
*  But here's the, if you know that, that's even more of how can this be possible? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=619.56s)]
*  I mean, if this kid was able to get this off, what would an Iranian agent, trained agent, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=625.3599999999999s)]
*  be able to pull off? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=629.9599999999999s)]
*  This is very, very disturbing, very disturbing. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  And we need to get to the bottom of it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=633.7199999999999s)]
*  And quickly, we need to, and she needs to resign because she has no credibility left. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=635.4399999999999s)]
*  She literally has no credibility. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=640.4s)]
*  I imagine even with her own agent. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=641.92s)]
*  I'll tell you one last thing and I'll get this reaction from Senator Cruz. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=643.16s)]
*  Senator, it cannot be this agency investigating themselves. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=651.56s)]
*  We must have an outside agency. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=652.56s)]
*  Absolutely, and we need accountability to the American people. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=653.9599999999999s)]
*  They're obvious questions. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3J0dmFBz40&t=657.0799999999999s)]
