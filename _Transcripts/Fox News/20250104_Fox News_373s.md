# Mike Johnson is smart and resilient, Rep. Claudia Tenney says
**Fox News:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY)
*  New York Congresswoman Claudia Tenney, along with Congressman, representing Virginia's beautiful [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=0.0s)]
*  sixth district, Ben Klein, and Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs from a wonderful part of Arizona as [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=6.08s)]
*  well. All right. Thank you so much here. Claudia, I want to start with you, Congresswoman, I should [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=12.96s)]
*  say more officially. What was it like on the floor today? What did the, what was the feeling? I mean, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=18.0s)]
*  there was this, from the outside in, it looked like, hey, this could get a little contentious. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=25.84s)]
*  Who knows what these last few votes were going to bring. What really went down on the floor? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=30.64s)]
*  Yes. Well, it's great to see you, Jason, and my colleagues. I want to first say that I come from [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=36.4s)]
*  one of the most, if not the most beautiful district in the entire United States, New York 24, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  which spans the shoreline of Lake Ontario, has the Finger Lakes, and, you know, it's just an [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=45.36s)]
*  amazing place as well. So it was quite, it was a little harrowing a little bit today, but, you know, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=49.6s)]
*  I have to say, and I'm really excited that Mike Johnson has never lost a speaker race so far. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=55.12s)]
*  And it's because he's smart, he's resilient, he respects every single member. You never hear [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=60.32s)]
*  him say anything negative about them. He tries to work with each member. He understands how diverse [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=65.36s)]
*  our conference is. And he also understands that each member has a mission to represent that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=70.16s)]
*  district. And he's trying to do the best job he can with the narrowest majorities. And as, you know, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=74.96s)]
*  you just had the great former speaker, Newt Gingrich, on who has said it's the most difficult [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=79.68s)]
*  speakership that he's known of in the modern era, more difficult than even his job. And Mike [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=83.6s)]
*  does it with humility and patience. And he's a true constitutional conservative. But right now, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=88.0s)]
*  he's leading the House with very diverse views. So I think that's where he deserves his condaâ€”to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  be con- con- commended, because it is so hard to deal with all the divergent views, which is good. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  The Republican Party doesn't fall in lockstep. We think about a lot of things, and we stand up for [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=104.88s)]
*  our country. But we also, all of us, want to get the Trump agenda done. And it's Mike Johnson [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=110.4s)]
*  working yin and yang with Donald Trump that's going to make that happen. And I think they're [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=115.84s)]
*  a wonderful partnership, by the way. Congressman Klein, what's your perspective? Like, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=119.2s)]
*  what do you expect in this Congress? I mean, it seems like week in and week out, it's going to be [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=125.92s)]
*  high drama with such a small margin. One of you in the body goes the other direction. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=130.8s)]
*  It's hard to get everybody into HC5. And they're even offering Chick-fil-A, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=135.68s)]
*  and you can't get all the members in there. So how are they going to move votes in the House [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  is a big question. Well, it's going to take a uniter like Mike Johnson to get the job done. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=143.44s)]
*  We're about to enter into one of the most consequential periods in our nation's history, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=148.96s)]
*  but the next four years are going to be amazing. And I can't think of a better partnership than [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=154.16s)]
*  Donald Trump and Mike Johnson. Mike Johnson is a nice guy. He is an honest guy, a trustworthy guy, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  but he's a fighter. He was a fighter for Donald Trump on the Judiciary Committee, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=164.88s)]
*  on which Andy and I serve. And he is a fighter now as speaker for the values that the American [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=168.88s)]
*  people sought when they elected Donald Trump and when they elected Republican majorities in the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=175.2s)]
*  House and the Senate. So we're looking to implement and to actually get past legislation that's going [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=180.24s)]
*  to deliver for the American people, whether it's a secure border, whether it's tackling inflation, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=185.68s)]
*  whether it's returning education control to families, you name it. Those are conservative [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=190.8s)]
*  issues that Mike Johnson has fought for his entire career and that he's going to be [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  fighting for alongside Donald Trump for the next two years as speaker. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  Andy Biggs, you've, look, you've been in Congress a little bit. You're on the Judiciary Committee. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, you're, you know, the ropes there. Explain to us where this reconciliation package [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  is going, because I think that will be a tussle. I think generally Republicans want to have it all, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=216.32s)]
*  right? They don't want to settle for anything less, but you have to kind of pick and choose [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  what goes first, what comes later. So how is that going to play out? What do you see happening? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=226.0s)]
*  Well, as a lot of people don't understand, you only get two whacks at it, really, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=232.0s)]
*  two reconciliation bills. And Speaker Newt Gingrich just said, well, you should do the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=237.92s)]
*  easy stuff first, like border. I'm not sure that's where the Trump transition team is. I don't think [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=244.4s)]
*  we're kind of splitting the conference, but I think where it's going to go, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  and I think I'm going to use this phrase, big, beautiful bill, I think it's going to, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=253.12s)]
*  because I think it's going to have that border security stuff in it, but I also think it's going [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=259.68s)]
*  to have some tax policy in that first one. And why is that? Because I do agree with Representative [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=264.24s)]
*  Gingrich, Speaker Gingrich, you have got to get the tax package done as early as possible because [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=270.08s)]
*  that will be the kickstarter to the economy, and that's what saves the rest of the administration [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  for the next two years after that. But here's the thing to understand as well. The last time [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=283.52s)]
*  you actually were able to successfully pass two separate burbs in the same year, budget [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=289.2s)]
*  reconciliation bills in the same year, was when Newt Gingrich was the Speaker, 97, so almost 30 [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=296.64s)]
*  years ago. So that's why I think there's a lot of sentiment to say let's try to get the full enchilada [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=302.96s)]
*  at first, understanding that we might not be able to get all of it, and what we can't get done there [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=309.52s)]
*  we'll pull through in the second time, but you want to facilitate the quickest, largest, successful [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=314.0s)]
*  package that you can. Well, I think that's wise advice. And look, having been there, I served in [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=321.2s)]
*  Congress eight plus years with a margin this tight. You've got to make sure everybody's showing up. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=329.28s)]
*  Nobody can fall down. Literally, everybody's got to be there and be on their game. And that's not [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  just for reconciliation, that's for every single day and every single vote. And Democrats are going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=340.8s)]
*  to be ready to pounce, so good luck to you. Congratulations being sworn into this new Congress, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=346.56s)]
*  and the country's counting on you. There's big expectations, so congratulations to you. Thanks [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3FrVJFgtsY&t=352.48s)]
