# Rep. Jim Jordan responds to 'ridiculous' investigation by Fulton County DA Fani Willis
**Fox News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8)
*  While scandal-plagued Fulton County DA Fonny Willis wrote House Judiciary Committee Chairman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=0.0s)]
*  Jim Jordan a letter accusing him of bullying her and telling him to instead visit children [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  in his district and celebrate Black History Month. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=9.68s)]
*  And meanwhile, one anti-Trump IRS contractor allegedly released information on what now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=12.88s)]
*  appears to be hundreds and hundreds of thousands of taxpayers, but the left is worried about [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=17.78s)]
*  Doge. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, according to the House Judiciary Committee, Republicans' new disclosures show that Charles [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Little John leaked information on more than 405,000 taxpayers, including President Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=29.48s)]
*  Little John is currently serving a five-year sentence for the leaks, but the new filings [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=36.56s)]
*  reveal the leak was nearly six times larger than previously known. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=40.68s)]
*  Here with more, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=44.68s)]
*  All right, I'd like the answer the president gave on targeting. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about targeting. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=51.16s)]
*  And you were involvedâ€”you were on this program a lot when they lied and peddled the conspiracy [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=53.44s)]
*  theory about the Russia hoax. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  You were on about FISA abuse quite a bit on this program. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=60.64s)]
*  You were on when they targeted Donald Trump with jacked up charges in New York and a false [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  valuation of Mar-a-Lago and a double standard when it came to top secret classified information. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=69.64s)]
*  Let's talk about targeting. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=75.8s)]
*  Are we going to get to the bottom of these issues and who is corrupt? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=76.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's why we sent seven penis to the FBI yesterday to get the answers to the questions [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=79.6s)]
*  the American people have. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=85.32s)]
*  But you're exactly right, Sean. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  President Trump was targeted by Jim Comey, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Alvin Bragg, Fonny [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=88.48s)]
*  Willis, Jack Smith. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=93.44s)]
*  And now we learned the IRS. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  This Charles Littlejohn guy, he went to the IRS as a contractor with a specific goal [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  to get President Trump's tax return and release it to some left-wing media publication, which [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  is what he did. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=108.56s)]
*  But he also did it for 405,000 other entities, individuals and businesses. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=109.92s)]
*  And he gets charged with one count. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  One count is all the Biden, Garland, Justice Department went after this guy for. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, you're exactly right as well that when they go after Elon Musk, oh, he's going [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  to get access to information he shouldn't. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=127.0s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=128.96s)]
*  Look what they did. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=129.96s)]
*  Look what this guy did to the president of the United States and 405,000 other Americans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=131.0s)]
*  Didn't we learn that little old Sean Hannity, just a little talk show host that I am, that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=137.32s)]
*  my personal information was gone through? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=142.4s)]
*  When they suppressed my social media accounts, didn't thousands of my personal text messages [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  get released? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=150.32s)]
*  Do I not have privacy as a member of the press? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=151.32s)]
*  Nobody seemed to care when that happened to me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=156.76s)]
*  I don't recall anybody in the state-run legacy media mob defending me, not that I would expect it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=158.68s)]
*  No, they didn't defend you, but it happened to you because you make a difference, because [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=164.28s)]
*  you have an impact. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=168.32s)]
*  That's why it's always, you know, I always tell folks if the left isn't coming after [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=169.32s)]
*  you, you're probably not doing anything worthwhile. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=173.12s)]
*  You're doing things worthwhile. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  That's why they came after you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=176.52s)]
*  I remember when we got shadow banned back in 2018 during the whole Trump-Russia collusion [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=177.72s)]
*  thing, there were four members of Congress who just happened to be digging into what [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=182.4s)]
*  the Comey FBI had done to President Trump and we get shadow banned. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=186.0s)]
*  Thank goodness we've changed what Michael Schellenberger, who wrote some of the Twitter [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  files called this censorship industrial complex. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=195.24s)]
*  Thank goodness Elon Musk, President Trump, and I'd like to think some of the work we've [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=198.52s)]
*  done on the judiciary committee has made a difference in that area as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=201.8s)]
*  So we just got to keep that effort up and make sure that this censorship stuff doesn't [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=205.28s)]
*  happen anymore. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=209.8s)]
*  Okay, what about Fonny Willis writing you a letter accusing you of bullying her? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=211.08s)]
*  Really, what would you like to know from Fonny Willis? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=217.8s)]
*  Well, we've had outstanding requests to her for information. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  We've gotten some. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  There are people we want to talk to who worked on the Fonny Willis investigation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=225.52s)]
*  We've deposed Nathan Wade. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  He came here and basically didn't answer hardly any of our questions, so we want to do some [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=231.56s)]
*  follow-up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=236.16s)]
*  We're committed to getting the answers for the American people on that ridiculous investigation [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=237.16s)]
*  that she undertook, as well as the subpoenas we've sent to Cash Patel to get information [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=241.08s)]
*  on the school boards issue, the memorandum which said pro-life Catholics are extremists [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=246.24s)]
*  in the Richmond FBI field office. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=250.72s)]
*  We want information on those 26 confidential human sources, 17 of which entered restricted [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=252.88s)]
*  space. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=258.16s)]
*  None of them were charged. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=259.16s)]
*  They weren't authorized to go there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=260.16s)]
*  Four went in the Capitol, and two of the four who went in the Capitol were asked to be here [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  that day by the FBI. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=265.48s)]
*  I want to know how much were these people paid, how long they worked. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=267.72s)]
*  Lots of questions that we want to get answers to that we think the American people would [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=270.6s)]
*  like that information, so we're going to work on all that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=274.0s)]
*  Let me go back to weaponization, for example. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=277.04s)]
*  Those people that were involved in the weaponization of the DOJ, FBI, intel community, the people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=280.36s)]
*  that did the day-to-day work on issues that they never should have been involved in. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=288.48s)]
*  What should happen to them? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=293.64s)]
*  Well that's up to the Justice Department, and I'm very confident in Pam Bondi, Todd [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=295.84s)]
*  Blanchett, who was going to go there as Deputy Attorney General, Cash Patel, Dan Bongino, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=299.48s)]
*  that team that President Trump's put together. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=303.56s)]
*  I'm confident, and they're going to dig into this stuff just like we are, and if they think [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=305.48s)]
*  someone needs to be prosecuted, someone needs to be looked at, that's the Justice Department's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=309.24s)]
*  decision. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=313.08s)]
*  But I trust these individuals. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=314.08s)]
*  They're the kind of folks we want in these positions who are going to focus on protecting [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=315.12s)]
*  the American people, not going after the American people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  All right, Jim Jordan, we really appreciate you being with us, and it's going to be interesting [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  days ahead, and we've got to clean it up. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=327.4s)]
*  We've got to return the FBI to the world's premier law enforcement agency. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=329.68s)]
*  We can't have a weaponized Department of Justice. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=333.68s)]
*  Those people that have been involved, they've got to be removed, and you've got to have [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  people of integrity put in that place. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=339.44s)]
*  All right, when we come back, Congressman Byron Donalds will join us. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  Apparently, he has an announcement. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  You don't want to miss it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Straight ahead. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWRidw_hPs8&t=346.59999999999997s)]
