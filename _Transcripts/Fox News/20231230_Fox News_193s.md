# This is all about money: Former Trump adviser
**Fox News:** [December 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU)
*  May Mailman is a former Trump legal advisor and she joins us now. May, your take, Republican [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=0.0s)]
*  governor has an opportunity to sign a bill, doesn't, why? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=9.36s)]
*  Yeah, he's my governor and I testified on this bill alongside Riley Gaines and a bunch [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=15.0s)]
*  of detransitioners, people who really care about this, and the ACLU won. The ACLU congratulated [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=20.44s)]
*  Mike DeWine today and it's really perplexing because this is a 70-30 issue. 70% of Americans [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=25.72s)]
*  say no to carving up kids' genitals, say no to young men playing women's sports, and yet [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=33.24s)]
*  Mike DeWine can't agree with 70% of people. Why? And you nailed it. There is money involved. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=39.44s)]
*  If you look at nine of the top ten employers in the state of Ohio, they are related to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  healthcare like Cleveland Clinic and Abbott Labs, which is the original manufacturer of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=52.3s)]
*  Lupron, which is the puberty blocker drugs, they have a headquarters in Columbus, Ohio [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  for their nutrition branch. So this really boils down to money. I think there's also [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=64.82s)]
*  an age factor. I have to worry about my daughters participating in sports with boys and getting [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=68.82s)]
*  undressed in front of boys. Mike DeWine is 76. He doesn't have to worry about that. He [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=75.34s)]
*  doesn't have to worry about his kids getting carved up as minors. So you've got to follow [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=80.30000000000001s)]
*  the money, which you're exactly right. But it's just, if it is a 70-30, did he get hoodwinked? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=85.7s)]
*  Does he just have no courage? Is he afraid of the backlash? I mean, okay, the money thing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=91.5s)]
*  is legit. But what else? I mean, ultimately, you're the leader of a state where you know [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=95.86s)]
*  your voters agree with you on stopping something like this and yet you cave anyway. Yeah, so [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=101.06s)]
*  I guess the option number three is that he actually believes it. And that seems to be [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=108.46s)]
*  what the Ohio House leader, one of the authors of the bill, seems to think, which is that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=114.02s)]
*  he actually thinks that if you don't cut out a girl's uterus, that she might be at risk [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=120.3s)]
*  of dying. But you know what? The studies say exactly the opposite. People who are transgender, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=126.42s)]
*  there was a study in Europe, have an eight times higher suicide rate. That means that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=132.86s)]
*  the more that transgender ideology pervades our culture, the sicker our people become, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=138.38000000000002s)]
*  the sicker our kids become. So how about when someone comes in and they've got depression [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=144.18s)]
*  and they've got PTSD and they've suffered from sexual abuse and they're unloved and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  they're lonely and they're confused about their gender, we worry about all those other [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=154.38000000000002s)]
*  things first. We treat all those other things first. We help people find religion, we help [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  them find love, we help them find community, and then we worry about the gender transition [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=164.5s)]
*  later. Yeah, and in those cases, again, it goes back to a system that is incentivized [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=169.7s)]
*  to keep people to be patients. And Mike DeWine is furthering it. May Mehlman, thank you very [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=174.94s)]
*  much for your time. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGZiS5LtaU&t=179.7s)]
