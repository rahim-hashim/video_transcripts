# Sean Hannity: Journalism has been replaced by liberal activism
**Fox News:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg)
*  One big problem, journalism is dead. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg&t=0.0s)]
*  It is buried. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg&t=3.14s)]
*  This is something that I, well, accurately said back in 2007 or 2008, when the press [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg&t=4.54s)]
*  turned into giddy cheerleaders for the anointed one, Barack Obama. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg&t=10.52s)]
*  Now, for almost every newsroom in America, it'sâ€”they're not news. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg&t=14.74s)]
*  They're opinion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg&t=19.18s)]
*  They're talk show hosts. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg&t=20.18s)]
*  They're radical leftist talk hosts. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg&t=21.18s)]
*  With a few exceptions, journalism has now been replaced by liberal, radical activism. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg&t=23.32s)]
*  Journalists are far-left hacks, some of them flirting right on the borderline with communism. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVr2xqRMIEg&t=30.0s)]
