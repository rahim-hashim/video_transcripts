# Sean Hannity: These policies are dangerous
**Fox News:** [August 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o)
*  And welcome to Hannity, and in just a few short hours, the Democratic National Convention [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=0.0s)]
*  will officially get underway in the Windy City in Chicago, in Illinois. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=7.28s)]
*  As you can see, the protests have begun. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=10.84s)]
*  We'll have full coverage tonight. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=13.0s)]
*  Also, we're going to give you tonight the definitive and complete guide to what you [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=14.64s)]
*  will see and hear all week long, and more importantly, what you will not see and hear [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  all week long. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=24.8s)]
*  Don't expect any big revelations. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=25.8s)]
*  Look, conventions, they're so choreographed that the convention itself will be scripted [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=28.16s)]
*  to the second. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=33.44s)]
*  There will probably be more attention dedicated to smearing and slandering and besmirching [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=35.1s)]
*  Donald Trump than talking about their own candidates and their own failed records. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  And besides, party leaders, they'd frankly prefer—they've been doing a good job of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=44.08s)]
*  it so far, I don't think it'll last—they'd prefer that you know nothing about Kamala [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  and Tim Walz' radical positions. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=53.6s)]
*  Look at this new McLaughlin poll, very revealing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=56.28s)]
*  It found a huge majority of Democratic and independent voters are totally and completely [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=58.96s)]
*  unaware of her support for eliminating private health insurance. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=65.08s)]
*  And of course, that would include universal health care and Medicare for all. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=69.36s)]
*  They're unaware of her wanting to defund ICE, comparing them to the KKK, or her position [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=73.68s)]
*  of decriminalizing illegal immigration, and then free housing and education and health [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=79.12s)]
*  care. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=83.88s)]
*  And of course, defund, dismantle, no bail laws. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=84.88s)]
*  And that represents, to me—think about this—that is a huge opportunity for Team Trump to educate [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  and to inform the American people how radical, extreme, and they are dangerous. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  These policies are dangerous to the country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, the DNC will stay far and away, four very specific things. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  Now, they will not want to ever talk about Kamala, all the things she has said in her [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  own words, or any previous far-left policy issue. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  They will avoid at all costs playing Governor Walz in his own words about his own radical [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  beliefs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=125.64s)]
*  Thirdly, there will also be no mention of Kamala and Tim Walz' numerous flipping and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=126.64s)]
*  flopping and flailing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  See, it's very revealing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  The campaign knows that if they tell you the truth and you hear them in their own words, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=135.28s)]
*  the odds of them winning are next to zero. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=140.68s)]
*  So they've got to hide it, and they're going to try to hide it, just like they hid [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=143.56s)]
*  Joe Biden in the basement all through 2020. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=146.54s)]
*  And lastly, you're not going to hear about the, as you can see, beginning in Chicago—and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  this is the beginning of what will be a long week—the pro-Hamas lunatics, the people [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=155.76s)]
*  who support they need, protesting all over the city that Kamala has been and continues [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=162.5s)]
*  to appease. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=168.46s)]
*  They will try to ignore this crazy base that she needs to vote for her in order to win. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=169.8s)]
*  Kind of like Democrats lying, remember, all throughout the summer of 2020? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=177.4s)]
*  Oh, nearly 600 riots. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=180.94s)]
*  Let's see, dozens of dead Americans, billions and billions in property damage. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=182.9s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=188.5s)]
*  Cops pelted with bricks, rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails, thousands of injured cops. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=189.58s)]
*  And what did they tell us? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=195.78s)]
*  They said, mostly peaceful. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=196.78s)]
*  You see images of cities burning. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=198.82s)]
*  It's mostly peaceful. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=200.42s)]
*  Anyway, they were lying. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=201.74s)]
*  They were anything but peaceful. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=203.34s)]
*  On this program, we will do our best to remind you who Kamala Harris and Tim Walz really [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=205.1s)]
*  are, who their supporters really are. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=210.18s)]
*  You're seeing a lot of them right now marching on the streets of Chicago. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=212.78s)]
*  And we will share all of their radical views. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=216.3s)]
*  It's all up on my website, Hannity.com. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  You can download it, share it with friends, neighbors, coworkers. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=220.74s)]
*  You can put it on social media, share it with strangers. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=224.62s)]
*  Now, we start tonight with the board, Borders are, and her comments on immigration and customs [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=227.5s)]
*  enforcement agency, or ICE, as they call it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=233.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=235.94s)]
*  The Klan was what we would call today a domestic terrorist group. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=236.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  Why would we call them domestic terrorist group? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  Because they tried to use fear and force to change political environment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=246.62s)]
*  And what was the motivation for the use of fear and force? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  It was based on race and ethnicity. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=253.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=255.66000000000003s)]
*  Are you aware of the perception of many about how the power and the discretion at ICE is [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=257.06s)]
*  being used to enforce the laws? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=265.54s)]
*  And do you see any parallels? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=268.7s)]
*  I do not see any parallels between sworn officers and agents. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=270.38s)]
*  I'm talking about perception. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=274.26s)]
*  I do not see a parallel between what is constitutionally mandated as it relates to enforcing the law. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=276.02s)]
*  Are you aware that there's a perception? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=281.5s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question that we've got to critically reexamine ICE and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=283.06s)]
*  its role and the way that it is being administered and the work it is doing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=287.62s)]
*  And we need to probably think about starting from scratch. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=291.34s)]
*  Now, sadly, Como's hatred for border security doesn't begin and end with ICE. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=294.58s)]
*  In fact, she apparently wanted or still wants to decriminalize all illegal immigration and, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=299.9s)]
*  of course, as we told you, provide all illegal immigrants with your taxpayer-funded everything. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=305.82s)]
*  And apparently thinks that a border wall is—that's ridiculous. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=311.94s)]
*  It's a vanity project of Donald Trump. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=315.34s)]
*  And he believed that terrorists would be invading the country, would want to come across our [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=318.78s)]
*  wide-open southern border. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=324.3s)]
*  Why would anyone ever want to do that? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=326.38s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=328.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=329.38s)]
*  You support giving universal healthcare, Medicare for all, to people who are in this country, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  illegally? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=335.74s)]
*  Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=336.74s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=339.1s)]
*  to public safety, public education or public health, period. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=346.3s)]
*  We have to have a secure border, but I am in favor of saying that we're not going to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=351.38s)]
*  treat people who are undocumented and cross the border as criminals. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=355.54s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=358.74s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=359.74s)]
*  I believe if someone crosses over the border, it's illegally—it is illegal, and you would [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=360.74s)]
*  decriminalize it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=363.98s)]
*  I would not make it a crime punishable by jail. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=365.22s)]
*  It should be a civil enforcement issue, but not a criminal enforcement issue. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=368.62s)]
*  It's a height of irresponsibility for the commander-in-chief to suggest that we have [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=372.66s)]
*  to build a wall across our southern border because there are terrorists who are trying [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=379.22s)]
*  to invade the country. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=384.70000000000005s)]
*  It couldn't be farther from the truth. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=387.98s)]
*  They're actually here. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=393.02000000000004s)]
*  We know they're here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=394.56s)]
*  They confirm being here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=395.56s)]
*  Now, of course, this week, you also won't hear whether or not Kamala still supports [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  these insane policies. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  Take a look at your screen, along with her big supporters in Chicago. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  The DNC is not going to dare mention the names of the people, those that were murdered, those [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=406.56s)]
*  that were raped, the victims of other horrific, violent crimes by the unvetted Harris-Biden [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  illegal immigrants. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=419.64s)]
*  Also this week, they're not going to mention all the people with the terror ties that are [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=421.48s)]
*  confirmed in the country because of Kamala and Joe's open border policies, but they [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=425.8s)]
*  kept telling us for three-plus years, the border's secure, the border's closed. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=430.52s)]
*  And now she wants a pathway to citizenship. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=434.88s)]
*  Well, a pathway to citizenship would be called amnesty, in other words, simply rewarding [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=437.84s)]

*  Here's her, in her own words. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=444.28s)]
*  They won't mention it this week. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=446.66s)]
*  We know our immigration system is broken and we know what it takes to fix it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=449.32s)]
*  Comprehensive reform that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=456.68s)]
*  And her Bernie Sanders running mate, well, isn't exactly, you know, bringing anything [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=470.24s)]
*  better to the table, but the convention, it won't mention that Wall supports sanctuary [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=474.44s)]
*  cities and states and that he signed legislation to give illegal driver's licenses and free [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=478.92s)]
*  taxpayer-funded college educations. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=485.44s)]
*  How nice of him to spend your money this way. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  There is no moving too fast on driver's license for all. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  Should Minnesota be a sanctuary state? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  If the definition of that is that the federal government enforces immigration law and local [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  law enforcement enforces local law, then yes. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=503.16s)]
*  Should cities be allowed to be sanctuary cities? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=506.12s)]
*  Yes, local control. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=508.24s)]
*  He's not going to do anything. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=509.24s)]
*  You know, he talks about this wall. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=510.24s)]
*  I always say, let me know how high it is. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=512.16s)]
*  If it's 25 feet, then I'll invest in the 30-foot ladder factory. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=513.64s)]
*  30-foot ladder factory. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=518.56s)]
*  How nice of them. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=520.28s)]
*  Don't expect to hear this week about the, you know, walls are common and they're flip-flopping [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=521.28s)]
*  on the issue of defund, dismantle, no bail laws, even for illegals and every other criminal. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=526.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=532.12s)]
*  Eliminate cash bail. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=534.12s)]
*  I've been a leader on that in the United States Senate. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=535.12s)]
*  Cash bail is not only a criminal justice issue, it's an economic justice issue, meaning people [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=538.92s)]
*  are sitting in jail because they don't have the money to get out. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=543.08s)]
*  Talk to me about the defund the police movement. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=548.96s)]
*  And what do you think is the most, the first piece of legislation that should happen towards [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=551.36s)]
*  reforming the police? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=557.76s)]
*  So at its essence, Andy, it really, I believe, is about reimagining public safety and how [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=560.6s)]
*  we achieve it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  Now think about this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  Walls did nothing for days and days on end while Minneapolis was burning, although his [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=572.9200000000001s)]
*  family, they did open the windows to their family home. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=578.72s)]
*  They wanted to smell burning rubber from the riots. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=583.4000000000001s)]
*  People died. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=587.1600000000001s)]
*  Police were injured. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=588.48s)]
*  There was hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=589.48s)]
*  because he did nothing, nothing at all. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=594.96s)]
*  And they even burned down a police precinct, ransacked business after business, setting [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=599.2800000000001s)]
*  fire to many of them along the way. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  But the DNC, by the way, they're not going to mention that four days after the police [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=606.32s)]
*  precinct was burned to the ground, that Kamala Harris herself tweeted out support for that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=611.6s)]
*  Minneapolis Minnesota bail fund. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=615.7s)]
*  And as a result, they raised over $40 million. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=618.46s)]
*  She also tweeted out that money was used to release rioters and other violent offenders, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=622.44s)]
*  including those accused of murder onto the street. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=627.44s)]
*  And she famously told, of course, the, well, ever so not funny Stephen Colbert, take note, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=630.44s)]
*  beware, they're not going to stop. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=637.44s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=639.44s)]
*  We're not going to stop. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=641.44s)]
*  Take note, beware. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=642.44s)]
*  Look. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=643.44s)]
*  This is a movement, I'm telling you, they're not going to stop. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=644.44s)]
*  Because they're not going to stop. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=648.44s)]
*  It is going to, they're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=649.44s)]
*  not going to stop after Election Day. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=652.44s)]
*  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels, that this isn't, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=654.44s)]
*  they're not going to let up, and they should not. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=659.44s)]
*  Beware, take note, they're not going to let up. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=662.44s)]
*  Anyway, nearly 600 riots, a couple dozen dead Americans, thousands of injured cops, billions [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=666.44s)]
*  in property damage as a result. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=671.44s)]
*  By the way, Liz Cheney and Never Trumpers, your silence is deafening because I think [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=673.44s)]
*  she sounds like an insurrectionist and riot supporter. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=679.44s)]
*  But, of course, no investigation. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=682.44s)]
*  But this won't be mentioned this week either. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=685.44s)]
*  They also won't discuss the insanity of Bidenomics, which until recently, Kamala was praising [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=687.44s)]
*  as her own too. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=694.44s)]
*  Think it's the greatest thing ever. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=695.44s)]
*  She's proud of it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=697.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=698.44s)]
*  All that, ladies and gentlemen, and everyone else, that is called Bidenomics. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=699.44s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics, and we are very proud of Bidenomics. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=705.44s)]
*  And as today's jobs numbers make clear, Bidenomics is working. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=713.44s)]
*  I forgot to mention that strange, nervous, giggling thing that goes on all the time. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=719.44s)]
*  Anyway, then I've got to mention Harris Biden inflation up over 20-plus percent overall [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=726.44s)]
*  from when Donald Trump was president. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=731.44s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=733.44s)]
*  Every American is paying more for everything they buy and every store that they go to. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=734.44s)]
*  Now ironically, in her speech Friday on price gauging, which she was supposed to say price [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=739.44s)]
*  gouging, take a look. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=745.44s)]
*  As president, I will go after the bad actors. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=747.44s)]
*  And I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gauging on food. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=757.44s)]
*  No price gauging. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=766.44s)]
*  She also referenced how badly people are feeling economically and the high prices of everything. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=767.44s)]
*  She didn't mention under their watch, but take a look. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=773.44s)]
*  As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=777.44s)]
*  cost of food. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=785.44s)]
*  We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=787.44s)]
*  and failed. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=794.44s)]
*  But our supply chains have now improved, and prices are still too high. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=796.44s)]
*  A loaf of bread cost 50 percent more today than it did before the pandemic. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=804.44s)]
*  Ground beef is up almost 50 percent. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=810.44s)]
*  Now she's saying on the campaign trail she's going to fix inflation. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=816.44s)]
*  Day one she's going to tackle inflation. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=820.44s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=822.44s)]
*  Kamala, where have you been? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=824.44s)]
*  You've been the vice president of this country for nearly four years, and you bragged that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=826.44s)]
*  you're the last person in the room when all these important decisions were being made. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=831.44s)]
*  You're proud of that. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=836.44s)]
*  So in other words, you're responsible for it. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=837.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=839.44s)]
*  President Biden always said that he wants you to be the last person in the room, particularly [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=841.44s)]
*  for big decisions, just as he was for President Obama. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=846.44s)]
*  He just made a really big decision. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=849.44s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=851.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=852.44s)]
*  Were you the last person in the room? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=853.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=854.44s)]
*  And you feel comfortable? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=855.44s)]
*  I do. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=857.44s)]
*  And I'm going to add to that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=858.44s)]
*  This is a president who has an extraordinary amount of courage. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=864.44s)]
*  Well, another disaster, by the way. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=872.44s)]
*  If she's the last person in the room when all these big decisions were made, why did [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=874.44s)]
*  she lie over and over again and say that the pullout in Afghanistan was fine, inflation [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=879.44s)]
*  is transitory, and brag up until now how great Bidenomics is, and lying and say that the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=885.44s)]
*  border was secure, even though she never went there, but she never went to Europe either. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=890.44s)]
*  And by the way, her social scheme to fight price gauging in the grocery industry is ridiculous. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=895.44s)]
*  It's costly. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=901.44s)]
*  It would decimate the entire economy. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=902.44s)]
*  Didn't work in the 70s in this country. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=904.44s)]
*  Didn't work in the former Soviet Union, Venezuela. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=907.44s)]
*  Why does she think it would work now? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=910.44s)]
*  Now, the profit margin in the grocery industry is only 1.6 percent. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=912.44s)]
*  That is the lowest level in like five years. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=916.44s)]
*  And get this, not too long ago, she vowed she would use the power of the federal government [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=919.44s)]
*  to steal, to take patents if she doesn't like how companies are running their company. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=925.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=931.44s)]
*  She has the power to do it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=932.44s)]
*  I will snatch their patent so that we will take over. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=933.44s)]
*  And yes, we can do that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=937.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=940.44s)]
*  Yes, we can do that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=941.44s)]
*  Yes, we can do that. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=942.44s)]
*  It's what it's the question is, do you have the will to do it? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=943.44s)]
*  I have the will to do it. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=948.44s)]
*  You spend billions. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=951.44s)]
*  And yes, we could do it. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=953.44s)]
*  We'll just steal it from you. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=954.44s)]
*  That's the power of government. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=955.44s)]
*  This week, don't expect to see any mention of that plan to steal patents from private [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=957.44s)]
*  companies. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=961.44s)]
*  They also won't mention this week that Kamala cast a tie breaking vote on the Inflation [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=962.44s)]
*  Reduction Act. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=967.44s)]
*  Now, that's the one that allocated billions and billions of dollars to the IRS with a [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=968.44s)]
*  plan to specifically go after service workers and take on their tips and tax them, which [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=974.44s)]
*  she's now flipping on. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=980.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=981.44s)]
*  The yeas are 50, the nays are 50. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=982.44s)]
*  The Senate being equally divided. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=985.44s)]
*  The vice president votes in the affirmative, and the bill, as amended, is passed. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=987.44s)]
*  I'm going to hide all of this this week. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=993.44s)]
*  She's not going to mention that she referred to higher gas and energy prices under the [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=998.44s)]
*  Harris Biden administration as the cost of democracy. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1004.44s)]
*  You love paying more, don't you? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1008.44s)]
*  President Biden has said that Americans will feel some pain for the sake of defending freedom [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1011.44s)]
*  and liberty, but there does seem to be no end game in sight. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1015.44s)]
*  How long should Americans expect? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1020.44s)]
*  How long should we be bracing for this really sort of historic inflation and some unprecedented [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1022.44s)]
*  gas prices? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1030.44s)]
*  So we are committed in everything we are doing. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1032.44s)]
*  And yes, then the president did say in the State of the Union, there is a price to pay [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1035.44s)]
*  for democracy. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1043.44s)]
*  Got to stand with your friends. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1045.44s)]
*  Now, they inherited next to zero inflation rate from Donald Trump gas prices on average [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1050.44s)]
*  less than 250 gallon. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1054.44s)]
*  And you have now been paying anywhere from an average of 350 gallon or higher the last [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1056.44s)]
*  three years, all in the name of her radical socialist Marxist redistributive status Green [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1061.44s)]
*  New Deal. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1067.44s)]
*  But they won't mention she supported a complete ban on fracking or drilling either. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1068.44s)]
*  She's trying to flip and flop on that. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1072.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1074.44s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1075.44s)]
*  adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1081.44s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1085.44s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1088.44s)]
*  So would you ban offshore drilling? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1089.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1091.44s)]
*  And I've again worked on that. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1092.44s)]
*  Now, apparently she only changed the position since she became the presumptive nominee. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1096.44s)]
*  Nobody believes this is real. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1101.44s)]
*  Her staff knows that she will lose this race if Americans fully understand how extreme [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1103.44s)]
*  and radical she is and frankly how dangerous these policies are. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1111.44s)]
*  So this week, they're not going to mention she supported co-sponsored in the Senate with [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1115.44s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, the Medicare for All bill, universal health insurance, the elimination [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1120.44s)]
*  of your own private health insurance, so much for keep your plan. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1125.44s)]
*  What does the government run? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1128.44s)]
*  Well, the post office, Social Security, and the federal government. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1129.44s)]
*  Social Security and Medicare, they're headed towards insolvency. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1132.44s)]
*  They're going broke. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1135.44s)]
*  How's Obamacare working out for you? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1136.44s)]
*  Millions of Americans lost their doctors. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1138.44s)]
*  Millions lost their plans. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1140.44s)]
*  And the average American isn't saving a penny. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1142.44s)]
*  You're paying about 300% more. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1144.44s)]
*  Again, she co-sponsored in the U.S. Senate also the $93 trillion Green New Deal. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1146.44s)]
*  Call it communism, socialism, statism, but capitalism has been the single greatest wealth [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1153.44s)]
*  creator system, creating system ever designed by man. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1159.44s)]
*  That will cease to exist if she's elected and her Green New Deal and she would eliminate [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1164.44s)]
*  the filibuster to do it ever went into effect. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1169.44s)]
*  This too will be hidden all week long. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1173.44s)]
*  And you know, you're not going to hear much about the insanity of her foreign policy views [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1176.44s)]
*  like her stance on having the courage to say no longer say radical Islamic terrorism or [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1181.44s)]
*  illegal alien. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1186.44s)]
*  Those are forbidden words with Kamala. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1188.44s)]
*  We must have the courage to object when they use that term radical Islamic terrorism, which [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1191.44s)]
*  is more homophobic and over-dominant than the greatest victims of terror. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1200.44s)]
*  And we must also have the courage to reject that term illegal alien. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1209.44s)]
*  I have seen some of the worst of criminal behavior. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1218.44s)]
*  I have seen the worst of crime. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1223.44s)]
*  An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1226.44s)]
*  Now this is madness. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1231.44s)]
*  Under the Harris-Biden administration, the world is deteriorating before your very eyes. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1232.44s)]
*  Ukraine, their policy has been a disaster. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1236.44s)]
*  Putin, Russia, and Bolden, President Xi, China and Bolden, Kim Jong-un, North Korea and Bolden, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1239.44s)]
*  war in the Middle East, made possible in large part because Harris-Biden, they turned [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1245.44s)]
*  a blind eye to Iran, the number one state sponsor of terrorism, to sell oil in the world [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1250.44s)]
*  markets, and they got hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1255.44s)]
*  They waived sanctions to allow tens of billions into the hands of the mullahs in Iran. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1259.44s)]
*  They even wanted to give them six billion themselves in ransom. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1264.44s)]
*  The result? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1267.44s)]
*  Iranian proxy wars have escalated. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1268.44s)]
*  Iran planned and plotted and schemed and provided weaponry for the October 7th attack. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1271.44s)]
*  And when Iran fired weapons directly at Israel, well, okay, Harris and Biden, they did help [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1277.44s)]
*  Israel in their defense, but they surrendered, refused to support Israel in their right to [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1284.44s)]
*  retaliate and win their war against terrorists that killed the equivalent of 40,000 Americans [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1289.44s)]
*  in a single day. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1294.44s)]
*  And by the way, that has been their policy. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1296.44s)]
*  All Harris-Biden did was pressure Israel constantly, show restraint, show restraint, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1298.44s)]
*  take the win. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1303.44s)]
*  They didn't hit you with many rockets when they should have supported the full complete [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1304.44s)]
*  victory against the people that murdered, raped, tortured, kidnapped and beheaded their [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1308.44s)]
*  own citizens. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1312.44s)]
*  They show weakness. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1314.44s)]
*  They show appeasement and a degree, frankly, of utter ignorance at a level that is beyond [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1315.44s)]
*  chilling and scary for the entire world. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1320.44s)]
*  If America abandons its role on the world stage as the leader in the cause for liberty [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1322.44s)]
*  and freedom, well, this is the predictable, sad and tragic result. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1327.44s)]
*  But this is what you will see in Chicago this week. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1332.44s)]
*  None of that. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1336.44s)]
*  But you will see free vasectomies and abortions paid for by Planned Parenthood. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1337.44s)]
*  They get a whole lot of money from your tax dollars. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1342.44s)]
*  We'll hear also about, you know, unlimited abortion, no restrictions on abortion whatsoever [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1346.44s)]
*  until the moment of birth, brought to you courtesy of both Harris and Walls. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1352.44s)]
*  Then you've got, of course, here they've advocated for gender-affirming care with no [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1356.44s)]
*  parental notification. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1360.44s)]
*  Oh, parents, there's just mere obstacles in the way. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1362.44s)]
*  And by the way, Tampon Tim wants female hygiene products in boys' bathrooms in school. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1365.44s)]
*  Now, of course, this week in Chicago will be a complete Adam Schiff show, as, you know, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1373.44s)]
*  we're going to be showing you tonight. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1377.44s)]
*  But they will definitely try their hardest to ignore the expected chaos and rioting all [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1379.44s)]
*  around the convention. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1384.44s)]
*  Those are their supporters. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1385.44s)]
*  Now, coming up, Chicago bracing for thousands of anti-Israel protesters. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1387.44s)]
*  They have already taken to the streets tonight. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1391.44s)]
*  We'll show you what's going on as we continue this Sunday night edition of... [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3vyuCoMc0o&t=1394.44s)]
