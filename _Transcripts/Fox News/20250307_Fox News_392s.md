# Homan doubles down on warning to blue cities: 'We ARE bringing hell!'
**Fox News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY)
*  All right, President Trump's plans to secure our border and crack down on illegal immigrant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=0.0s)]
*  crime are working. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=5.92s)]
*  Earlier today, the Department of Homeland Security announced on X that under President [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=6.92s)]
*  Trump and Secretary Noem's leadership, and of course, Tom Homan, border crossings have [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=11.68s)]
*  dropped a whopping 94 percent. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=16.64s)]
*  Small business administrator Kelly Loeffler announced that the SBA will be moving regional [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=19.48s)]
*  offices out of sanctuary cities. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=24.52s)]
*  But after the mess left behind by the Biden administration, there's still a lot of work [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=27.26s)]
*  to do. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=30.740000000000002s)]
*  According to a new report, illegals are now cloning border patrol vehicles, all in an [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  attempt to bypass President Trump's border crackdown. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=37.7s)]
*  While the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, this story should numb the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=41.06s)]
*  conscience that almost 100 terror-linked illegals that they knew were terror-linked were released [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=45.38s)]
*  into the U.S. in 2024 alone. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=53.36s)]
*  And during her visit to New York City yesterday, Secretary Noem announced on X that ICE launched [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=56.66s)]
*  a detainer to take into custody the illegal who set a woman on fire at a subway station [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=63.419999999999995s)]
*  in Brooklyn, New York. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  But because of New York's sanctuary city status, the Department of Corrections will [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=70.74s)]
*  not honor that detainer. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=74.86s)]
*  Here with reaction is Border Czar Tom Homan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=76.97999999999999s)]
*  OK, they're not going to abide by it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=79.66s)]
*  What happens next, Tom? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=81.94s)]
*  Then Pam Bonnie sues them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=85.7s)]
*  We take them to court. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  But he's not going to get away. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=89.74s)]
*  You know, we have to sit outside that jail every day, 24-7. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=90.74s)]
*  We'll get our hands on them, because New York City or any other sanctuary city is not going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=94.66s)]
*  to stop ICE from keeping President Trump's promise to eradicate every criminal, illegal [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=98.46s)]
*  alien, every public threat, illegal alien, every nationalist threat, illegal alien from [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=103.9s)]
*  this country. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=107.78s)]
*  We'll get it done. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=108.78s)]
*  These just sanctuary cities make it harder and they make it more dangerous. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=109.78s)]
*  They're not going to stop what we're doing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=112.66000000000001s)]
*  OK, the Biden administration locked up or deported only eight out of the more than 100 [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=114.7s)]
*  illegal immigrants that they knew had suspected ties to ISIS who were crossing illegally into [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  the U.S., according to Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=127.9s)]
*  They knew who they were from. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=130.26s)]
*  They knew these illegals, you know, had connections or were known to have ties to ISIS-affiliated [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=131.58s)]
*  networks, and they still let them go in the country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=139.62s)]
*  Can you explain that to me? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=144.06s)]
*  Because I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=145.74s)]
*  No, I can't. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=148.02s)]
*  I appreciate your honesty. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=149.02s)]
*  And I'm with you, Sean. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=150.02s)]
*  I've been doing this since 1984. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=151.02s)]
*  I can't understand everything that Biden administration did. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=156.02s)]
*  I can't understand the 2.2 million known gotaways that they release in this country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=159.9s)]
*  And who the hell are those people? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=164.86s)]
*  2.2 million people paid more to get away. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=166.74s)]
*  They paid more not to take a free airline ticket to the city of choice, not to get a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=169.3s)]
*  free hotel room, not to get free medical care, not to get free meals a day, not to get a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=173.02s)]
*  free work authorization. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=178.82000000000002s)]
*  2.2 million people paid more not to take advantage of that giveaway program. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  How many of them came to come to the country sponsoring terror? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration had one thing in mind, optics. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=188.18s)]
*  Release them as quick as possible. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  Release them many times before the betting even came back because if there's no overcrowding, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=193.66000000000003s)]
*  they can keep making that false claim. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=198.98s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  It's all about optics. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  There was nothing, nothing about national security. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=203.26s)]
*  Well, and then there was the big lie that the border is secure and the border is closed, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  none of which was true. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  Are we making progress on the issue? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=213.14s)]
*  And I was asking Secretary Noem last night, are we making progress on identifying the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=215.92s)]
*  tipping off certain groups about pending ICE raids, which, as you know, puts the lives [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=223.14s)]
*  of officers at risk because the element of surprise has taken away and now they're walking [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=230.77999999999997s)]
*  into a trap and somebody's going to get killed unless we get to the bottom of who's tipping [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=237.17999999999998s)]
*  them off, meaning some innocent people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  Yes, we are making progress. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=246.14s)]
*  We are making progress. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=248.17999999999998s)]
*  Secretary Noem has opened up her own investigations through DHS IG. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=250.18s)]
*  We already found one dealing with that under investigation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=253.3s)]
*  Department of Justice, the FBI, the Deputy Attorney General, Emile Bové, he opened up [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=256.94s)]
*  another criminal investigation into the DOJ. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=263.94s)]
*  We will find them. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=266.9s)]
*  We will prosecute them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=268.4s)]
*  The least they're going to do is lose their jobs, but they need to be prosecuted and sent [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=270.26s)]
*  to prison because, as you said, this job is already dangerous enough. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=273.06s)]
*  What Trump has promised American people is we're going to concentrate on the most significant, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=276.82s)]
*  worst of the worst public safety threats. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=280.42s)]
*  The job's already dangerous and when they know we're coming, it's only a matter of time [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=282.38s)]
*  before an agent walks into an ambush because TDA don't care about life or death. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=286.82s)]
*  He does MS-13 and that's what we're looking for. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=290.9s)]
*  So this is discussing on every level. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=293.9s)]
*  Whoever it is needs to be prosecuted. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=295.7s)]
*  AG, Bondi is bringing lawsuits to states like New York and Illinois. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=297.9s)]
*  How many states do you identify right now that you think are having sanctuary status [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=302.62s)]
*  and aiding and abetting in the law breaking that also need to be sued? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=308.74s)]
*  You've got California, you've got Illinois, you've got New York, you've got Colorado, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=312.74s)]
*  you've got Washington State. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=319.94s)]
*  You've got many of them, but we have prepared a list for the AG and everybody she needs [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=321.54s)]
*  to look at. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=326.62s)]
*  And yesterday, hearing yesterday on sanctuary cities, you had four mayors sat there in [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=327.62s)]
*  Lydon and North Consolidate attacking me for a statement I made at CPAC that I'm going [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=332.4s)]
*  to go to Colorado. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=337.0s)]
*  I'm going to go to Boston. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=338.0s)]
*  I'm bringing hell with me because they've released 10 child rapists to the streets of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  that state. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=345.4s)]
*  So you're damn right. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=346.4s)]
*  I said I'm going to bring hell and I meant it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=347.4s)]
*  I said it, I meant it, we're going to do it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  We're bringing hell to every immigrant that commits crime in this country, especially [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=352.08s)]
*  those who rape children. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  I won't pull back on that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=358.28s)]
*  I said it, I meant it, we're doing it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=360.12s)]
*  That's what I like about you, Tom Holman. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=362.88s)]
*  You really pull your punches, you're a straddle of the fence, but in all honesty, if we can't [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  protect children, then what is the purpose of government? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=368.2s)]
*  This is fundamental and having somebody that committed gives a lot of Americans comfort. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=372.52s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=377.64s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=378.64s)]
*  We appreciate all the updates. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_2DLv1oFY&t=379.64s)]
