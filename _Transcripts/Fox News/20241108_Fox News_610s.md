# ‘ANNIHILATION’: Stephen A. Smith reacts to Trump’s comeback win
**Fox News:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM)
*  All right, here with his take. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=0.0s)]
*  I admit it publicly, he's a friend of mine. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=2.2s)]
*  We don't agree a lot on politics. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=5.32s)]
*  It's ESPN host. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=7.16s)]
*  He's a rock star. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=8.88s)]
*  There is no—as far as I'm concerned, there is no ESPN without my friend Stephen A. Smith. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=11.36s)]
*  I watched you on The View today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=16.64s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=17.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=18.64s)]
*  How are you doing, Sean? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=19.64s)]
*  Congratulations on the election and results. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=23.32s)]
*  You called it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=24.32s)]
*  You said it was going to happen. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=25.32s)]
*  I can't refute it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=26.32s)]
*  I can't refuse the fact that the president of the United States, the president-elect, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=27.48s)]
*  is well-deserving of it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  It was a romp. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=33.7s)]
*  It was an annihilation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=34.7s)]
*  I know a lot of people are trying to, you know, labor the—like, you know what? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=35.7s)]
*  He won a little bit in a lot of different places. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=39.24s)]
*  I don't want to hear that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  He won, and he won in absolutely convincing fashion, so much so that I think that in light [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=44.0s)]
*  of those results, we have to look at this election as a referendum on a Democratic Party [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  in America saying, we're not feeling where you are, we're not feeling where you tried [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=55.44s)]
*  to go, we want no part of it, we're not having it, and they made their choice, and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=59.68s)]
*  we all have to accept it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=65.32s)]
*  And you were very gracious, by the way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=67.48s)]
*  Privately, we have our own conversations, and you said that to me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=69.12s)]
*  And I'll live with it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=72.2s)]
*  And I've had elections that I really wanted my side to win, that they lost. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=74.0s)]
*  And you know what, Stephen A., I go on, and I plow through, and I do my job. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=78.32s)]
*  There's not going to be retribution. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=85.32s)]
*  None of the hosts of The View are going to be taken off. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=87.44s)]
*  I used to go on that show. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't even allow—they wouldn't accept a conversation with me at this point. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Isn't that pretty pathetic? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=96.36s)]
*  Because I used to like Whoopi Goldberg. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=97.36s)]
*  Joyless Behar, just a little— [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, listen, I would ask that you don't look at the show. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=100.88s)]
*  What you look at—what you should look at is the ideological tilt that has taken place [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=106.52s)]
*  in our country. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  We've gotten to a point where, God forbid, somebody has a difference of opinion and a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  different form of ideology than your damn near the Antichrist. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=118.76s)]
*  And that's not what makes this country great. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=122.92s)]
*  I mean, the reality is, is that, you know what, we could sit up there and we could say [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=124.72s)]
*  what we want, and everybody has their different opinions about Donald Trump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=128.12s)]
*  You know how I felt. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=131.76s)]
*  You knew why I didn't vote for him. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=132.76s)]
*  I don't like the way he behaves. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  I think the presidency is a statesmanship position, and I think that level of hubris [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=135.32s)]
*  that he's accustomed to showing needs to be dialed back significantly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=139.96s)]
*  But having said that, the bottom line is simple. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=143.4s)]
*  You can look at a lot of things on the right or the left. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=146.48s)]
*  He talked about the economy, OK? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=149.12s)]
*  He inherited—you know, Biden inherited—what was it? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=151.28s)]
*  Like 1.5 percent in terms of inflation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=153.56s)]
*  It ballooned to over 9.1 percent before it got dialed down a little bit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=156.44s)]
*  We looked at open borders. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=160.6s)]
*  Barack Obama was once considered the deporter-in-chief, because he actually deported more folks than [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=167.52s)]
*  So Biden comes into office, and the first thing he does, day one, executive order, he [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=168.56s)]
*  opens the borders. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=173.36s)]
*  And obviously, that created so much tension. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=174.56s)]
*  And then you look at the culture wars, the identity politics, you know, some of the transgender [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=177.12s)]
*  issues that people were bringing up in terms of individuals transferring—transitioning [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  from male to female and wanting to participate in female sports and stuff like that, or sharing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  the same bathrooms, females, and all of this other stuff. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=193.08s)]
*  America said, hey, we're not down for that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  We're not going for it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=198.6s)]
*  And no matter what you try to throw in our direction, that's not what we're concerned [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  about. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  We're primarily concerned about the economy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  We're primarily concerned about our borders and about being safe. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=206.16s)]
*  And they voted that way to send that message. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  And all we've heard over the last couple of days, those folks going absolutely back [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=213.56s)]
*  crazy because the candidate that they prefer to win didn't win. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=217.88s)]
*  And I just want to take a moment to remind everybody, this is America. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=222.2s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=225.6s)]
*  You don't get what you want. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=226.64s)]
*  But we are known for having intestinal resolve and making sure we're able to march forward [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=227.96s)]
*  and work with whoever candidate—whichever candidate ends up being in office and winning, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  and find a way to work with one another and reach some degree of compromise so we have [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=237.24s)]
*  civility in this country instead of chaos. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=242.64s)]
*  It's going to be up to Donald Trump to contribute to that, no doubt. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=245.12s)]
*  But the way I've seen some of the Democrats reacting since Kamala Harris' loss, to be [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=248.26s)]
*  quite honest with you, is utterly ridiculous. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=253.48s)]
*  I'm not going to get into any names, but it's been utterly ridiculous. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=255.48s)]
*  You know, one thing, when I'm on your show, I do all the talking. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  When you're on my show, I let you do all the talking. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=263.76s)]
*  We kind of have this unspoken agreement, because I always—together, when we have conversations, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  they're really thoughtful conversations. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=273.2s)]
*  They're real. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=274.68s)]
*  We keep it real. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=275.68s)]
*  You know, you always tell me to stay in my lane politics. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=276.68s)]
*  I tell you to stay in your lane sports. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=279.0s)]
*  But you're making a lot of sense tonight. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=280.84s)]
*  And they would be wise to listen to you, and more importantly, the spirit in which you're [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=282.88000000000005s)]
*  telling it, and I give you a lot of credit for that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=287.04s)]
*  You know, here's where I see it, and tell me what you agree or disagree with. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=289.44000000000005s)]
*  They could not run on one thing that they could point to where we were better off than [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=295.16s)]
*  we were four years ago, one major thing that improved the lives of the American people. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  The campaign ended with, you're a racist, you're a Nazi, you're a fascist, a misogynist, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  even Barack Obama and Stacey Abrams calling African-American men misogynists and sexists. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  Stacey Abrams says they're racist. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=319.04s)]
*  And a lot of what they said was just flat-out lies. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=321.68s)]
*  Kamala told us for three years the border was secure. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  It was not. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  Everybody knew it wasn't. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  She said for three years that inflation was transitory and denied that we had an inflation [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  problem. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=336.04s)]
*  She also lied during the campaign, her final argument. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=337.6s)]
*  She told American women. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=340.18s)]
*  She told them that Donald Trump's going to sign a national abortion ban. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=342.08s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  She said Donald Trump will limit your access to contraception. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=346.35999999999996s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=349.56s)]
*  She said that he would ban IVF. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=352.65999999999997s)]
*  She tried to scare seniors and say that he's going to take away your Social Security and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=353.8s)]
*  Medicare. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  He promised he would not do it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=359.47999999999996s)]
*  Benefits went up in his first term when he was president. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=360.64s)]
*  So analyze that strategy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  did or what you succeeded at. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=368.72s)]
*  So you're going to go to the lowest level, tell lies and call people Nazis and fascists. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  Not a good strategy, Stephen A. Not nice either. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=377.0s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to deny that it's not the greatest strategy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if you're entirely completely accurate in everything that you're saying, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=383.72s)]
*  because I can think of lies that the other side as well. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=387.8s)]
*  But I will say this to you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=390.32000000000005s)]
*  If you're Kamala Harris, what you could have done is lean on the reports that the economy [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=391.98s)]
*  was actually getting better and it actually is in a good place compared to where it was. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=397.36s)]
*  You could have acknowledged that guess what? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=402.64s)]
*  I was a bit wrong in a position that I took on the border. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=404.6s)]
*  And obviously it's not about flip flopping. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  It's about me correcting the error of my ways. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=411.88s)]
*  She didn't do that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=414.32s)]
*  But in the end, I will tell you, I'll do you a favor and tell you where the biggest [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=415.32s)]
*  crime came about from the Democratic Party. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=419.64s)]
*  You had a situation with Biden who promised to be a transitional president. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  He labeled himself a stopgap, somebody that was going to come in there, sort of calm the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  waters and then move out the way for young blood to come into the fray and new blood, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=434.32s)]
*  rather, to come into the fray and be the next president of the United States. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=440.36s)]
*  There was supposed to be a red wave in the midterms. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=443.90000000000003s)]
*  It didn't happen. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=445.76s)]
*  What does he do? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=446.92s)]
*  He's the incumbent. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=447.92s)]
*  He gets comfortable and says, I'm not going anywhere. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=448.92s)]
*  And that threw everything up in flux. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=451.12s)]
*  So suddenly he's debilitated a bit. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=452.92s)]
*  The cognitive decline is something that we were witnessing. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=455.52s)]
*  People were noticing it but didn't want to speak about it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=458.62s)]
*  You let him go on stage and get embarrassed. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=461.36s)]
*  June 27th, three and a half weeks later, you elevate her. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=463.48s)]
*  She never went through a primary or anything like that, which raised question marks. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=467.52s)]
*  And then what do you do from there on, Sean? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=471.48s)]
*  You've got—obviously they felt they needed to do whatever they could to get votes. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=473.76s)]
*  This is what they were doing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=479.64s)]
*  And it didn't work. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's what you have to applaud. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  The American people are smoking this shit. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=484.8s)]
*  We're not going for that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=486.08s)]
*  We're looking at policies. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=487.08s)]
*  We're not going for all of that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=488.08s)]
*  One last question. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  We don't have a lot of time. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  She never had to explain one time why she co-sponsored the Green New Deal, $93 trillion, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=492.68s)]
*  and said she'd eliminate the filibuster. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  She never had to explain her position on gun mandatory buybacks. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  She never had to explain why she said the rioters in 2020, 574 of them, won't stop, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  and she won't stop supporting them. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=510.6s)]
*  She never had to explain—she never had to explain, you know, why we're going to pay [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=512.6s)]
*  for free sex change operations for illegal immigrants. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=518.04s)]
*  Can I help you out? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=521.52s)]
*  And give them amnesty when they don't respect our laws. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=522.52s)]
*  Will you agree with me—and we have 30 seconds for you to answer—that legacy media is dead? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=525.24s)]
*  Do you agree or disagree? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=532.08s)]
*  I'm not going to say it's dead because I'm holding out hope that it can be resuscitated. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=535.12s)]
*  But hold on to this moment, Sean, because it's a rarity. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=540.36s)]
*  Hold on to this for the rest of your life, okay? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=543.4s)]
*  I am going to agree with you from the standpoint that what was done was inexcusable because [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=546.98s)]
*  it was favoritism in the media, and it had no place in it for a presidential election. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=553.68s)]
*  You've got to call balls and strikes, and that's not what people on both sides are doing, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=560.2399999999999s)]
*  but especially the left over the last couple of days. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=564.2399999999999s)]
*  They ain't calling balls and strikes, and they're wrong. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=567.2399999999999s)]
*  You're right, and it's your day. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=569.2399999999999s)]
*  Enjoy it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=571.2399999999999s)]
*  It's a rare moment, but you got it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=572.2399999999999s)]
*  I'm not looking for a rare moment. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=574.2399999999999s)]
*  You know, you and I have an announcement we're going to make pretty soon I think will shock people. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=576.2399999999999s)]
*  Fair enough? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=583.2399999999999s)]
*  Can I tease it that way? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=584.24s)]
*  Oh, Lord. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=585.24s)]
*  No, there's nothing to tease as of yet. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=586.24s)]
*  Oh, there is. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=589.8s)]
*  And I know your family. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=591.8s)]
*  I've met your family. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=592.8s)]
*  They're wonderful people. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=593.8s)]
*  You're a good man, Steve and I. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=594.8s)]
*  Appreciate you being with us. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDRhNT5ZUM&t=596.8s)]
