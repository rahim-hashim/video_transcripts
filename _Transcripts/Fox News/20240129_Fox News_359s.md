# We can't play whack-a-mole with the Houthis, Hezbollah and Hamas: GOP lawmaker
**Fox News:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k)
*  action. Florida Congressman Michael Waltz is with us. Fox and Friends Weekend co-host, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=0.0s)]
*  our friend Pete Hegseth is back with us too. You know, I listen to Joe Biden and I hear what he [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=5.12s)]
*  has to say here, and I listen, you know, and I'm just shocked, Congressman, because Iran's gotten [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=9.92s)]
*  the message that they can—what? You know, they've gotten the message? You know, don't is the message? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=17.04s)]
*  Well, they're not—they're not listening to don't, because they do and they do and they do [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  again and again and again. Well, Sean, as we all know, don't isn't a strategy. And on top of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=28.16s)]
*  the 165 attacks that you mentioned, they conduct—that's since October—they had conducted [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=38.0s)]
*  78 on top of that since Biden came into office. And I'll remind everyone, the reason we have small [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=45.28s)]
*  numbers of special operators, drone operators and others in the Middle East is they're still going [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=54.72s)]
*  after ISIS and keeping a boot on their neck so they don't hit us here. But, you know, right now [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=60.64s)]
*  they're sitting ducks for Iran and their militias. Sean, it is a simple reversal of policy. You hit [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=66.48s)]
*  the IRGC operatives that are running around the Middle East, including Soleimani's successor. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=75.68s)]
*  Number two, you drive up—you dry up the cash. Iran's received over $100 billion in oil sales, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=81.76s)]
*  waivers and hostage money since Biden has come in. And number three, that no one's talked about, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=89.84s)]
*  you've had multiple uprisings within Iran, the Green movement that Obama ignored and Massa Amini, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=95.92s)]
*  the poor woman who was murdered for daring not wear a hijab, and the uprising that followed from [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=104.48s)]
*  that murder. Let's not sit on our hands the next time the Iranian people say they want some change. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=110.4s)]
*  But look, we've got to reverse policy all roads lead back to Tehran instead of playing whack-a-mole [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=116.56s)]
*  with the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas, these militias. And I'm telling you, I'm talking to soldiers down [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  range right now. We are bombing empty warehouses in the middle of the night so that this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=130.24s)]
*  administration can check the box and say they're doing something. They're doing nothing that is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=135.68s)]
*  meaningful. And now we have more Gold Star families because of it, and it's infuriating. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  It is infuriating. And, you know, at some point when they attack our troops nearly 200 times, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, you know, when do we come to the conclusion that the only thing that they're going [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=152.48s)]
*  to listen to is force? Now, add one other component to this, and that would be I keep reading and I [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=157.04s)]
*  keep talking to sources and they keep telling me that Iran is a lot closer to nuclear capability [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=163.52s)]
*  than they've ever been, maybe just months away. Yes. And I can't imagine a world where that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=169.28s)]
*  radical ideology is married to nuclear weapons. I don't think mutually assured destruction would [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=175.12s)]
*  actually deter them. No, you hit the right point, Sean. That's the headline in this is this situation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=180.4s)]
*  gets that much more dangerous and difficult if Tehran has nuclear weapons. And that is that's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=188.8s)]
*  laid at the feet of Obama and Biden's appeasement strategy, who've gotten them that much closer. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  And they know it. And now they're counting on Russia to China to have their backs as well. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, Colonel Walsh has been on remote bases like I have in the middle of nowhere [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  in Iraq and Afghanistan. The only security you have, you don't know if your air defenses will [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=208.96s)]
*  ultimately hold in any particular situation. The only security you have at a unit level and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=213.2s)]
*  overall is whether or not you can go on the offensive. Can you push the initiative to kill [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  the bad guys and make sure they know if you attack Americans, you're dead? And what Colonel Walsh [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=223.44s)]
*  said is right at the micro level at the base level, I'm hearing from guys too overseas, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  they're not allowed to conduct aggressive offensive operations to secure their perimeter [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=233.76s)]
*  perimeter and take out bad guys to secure themselves. So they're sitting ducks in that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=238.32s)]
*  context. And then they're sitting ducks on a geopolitical context because the mullahs in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=242.24s)]
*  Tehran believe they have free range. And what is this White House talking about, Sean? What's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=246.96s)]
*  their strategy besides don't is we want to ceasefire in Gaza because they somehow believe that the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=251.44s)]
*  Houthis and the Iranians ultimately, if there's a ceasefire in Gaza, they'll stand back when all [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  they're using that as an excuse to hit us even more. And one more thing, these three Georgia [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  reservists, three Georgia reservists, God bless them, deployed out of Fort Moore. Do you know [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=267.84s)]
*  where Fort Moore is? I don't either. Do you know why? Because they renamed it. It was Fort Benning [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=273.2s)]
*  in Georgia. See, this administration has been more interested in renaming bases and social [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=278.56s)]
*  engineering. These guys, by the way, could be guarding the southern border. Instead, they're [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=283.44s)]
*  guarding the Jordan-Syrian-Iraq border and they're sitting ducks and it is on this administration. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=287.2s)]
*  There's no strategy. The problem is, Sean, I want them to be aggressive, but who do I trust? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  CQ Brown, Morgan Austin, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris? What do you do? You can't trust any of them. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=297.12s)]
*  No, it's scary. And, you know, what would, what does the net result here? We're going to have a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=303.2s)]
*  nuclear armed Iran. That ought to put fear into the hearts of every American. And, Congressman, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=307.68s)]
*  go ahead. Last word. No, I was just going to say, look, I mean, who do we trust? Well, I'll tell you, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=314.08s)]
*  under President Trump, ISIS was defeated. Baghdadi was dead. Iran was broke. And we [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=320.64s)]
*  had the Abraham Accords with multiple Arab countries and Israel, our greatest ally, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=328.0s)]
*  was stronger and vibrant and thriving. So I think we know our answer come this November. Let's get [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=333.76s)]
*  Donald Trump back in the White House that our enemies fear. All right, Congressman Walz, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=339.76s)]
*  Pete Hicks, thank you both. We appreciate you. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQ2jWKwL1k&t=345.28s)]
