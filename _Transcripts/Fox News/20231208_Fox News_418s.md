# Hannity: The Biden brand has never looked worse
**Fox News:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg)
*  And welcome to Hannity. And tonight, a major U.S. embassy hit with rockets, a shooting at a synagogue [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=0.0s)]
*  in New York and calls for a global Islamic antifada on American streets. And by the way, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=6.0s)]
*  that southern border, yeah, wide open, leaving our country totally vulnerable to terrorists. Now, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=12.56s)]
*  the president's mind is elsewhere. His big Hollywood fundraiser, that's going on today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=19.6s)]
*  His 53 year old son is in major trouble. The Biden brand has never looked worse than now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=24.24s)]
*  So don't expect to hear much from Joe Biden in the days and weeks ahead. Now, over and over again, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=30.32s)]
*  Joe Biden has been angry, demanding that Americans pay their fair share. He accused American families [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=36.0s)]
*  and businesses of being greedy and selfish. At the very same time, while his own beloved son, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=42.8s)]
*  was not paying any taxes on what amounts to millions of dollars in income, according to a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  federal indictment. And this, by the way, wasn't just your normal everyday kind of income. Now, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=55.12s)]
*  according to a federal indictment, Hunter was raking in tons of money from Ukraine and Romania [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  and China, all while daddy and pops was vice president and gearing up for a presidential run. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=66.48s)]
*  Joe Biden lied to your face over and over and over again. Take a look. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  for a Ukrainian energy company. When you were vice president in retrospect, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=83.36s)]
*  was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=87.28s)]
*  Nothing was unethical. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about what are you talking [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=91.36s)]
*  about? China. I have not had the only guy made money from China is this guy. He's the only one. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=98.4s)]
*  Nobody else has made money from China. That was a lie. And now that Biden's own DOJ [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=104.56s)]
*  has established that the president is a liar, I think the American people, you deserve to know [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=110.88s)]
*  exactly why. Well, well-connected people in China, Ukraine, Romania, Kazakhstan, you know, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=117.36s)]
*  why were they paying Hunter Biden and admitted addict at the time millions of dollars? Oh, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=123.76s)]
*  by the way, with no experience. Now we, the American people, we deserve answers from this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=129.68s)]
*  weaponized DOJ. Why was prosecutor Weiss prepared to put all of this under the rug? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=135.52s)]
*  He wanted no charges, despite what is a mountain of evidence that he just now revealed. Now, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=141.76s)]
*  if not for two brave IRS whistleblowers telling the truth and one Delaware judge asking questions, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=148.88s)]
*  if not for Rudy Giuliani, his attorney Bob Costello and the New York Post telling the truth [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=155.2s)]
*  about Hunter's very real laptop. Guess what? None of these charges would have been filed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=160.48s)]
*  Now, why is that? Why were Weiss and Garland, you know, why were they doing Joe Biden such a favor? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=166.32s)]
*  Were they trying to influence an election? Do they usually give a pass to tax cheats? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=172.96s)]
*  Now, the crimes listed in this indictment, they are egregious. Now, Biden is accused of willfully [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  refusing to pay taxes in 2016, 17, 18, 19, and in 2017 and 18, he didn't even bother filing a tax [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=185.76s)]
*  return. And remember, prosecutor Weiss, he let the statute of limitations run out in the unpaid taxes. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=193.84s)]
*  Those were the barisma years. How convenient. He also accused of committing fraud by deducting a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=201.12s)]
*  sex club membership and porn subscriptions as business expenses. Are you kidding me? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, during this time, Hunter lived a quite extravagant lifestyle, according to the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=214.72s)]
*  indictment, spending nearly $700,000 on various women, another $400,000 on clothing, accessories, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=219.44s)]
*  $188,000 on adult entertainment, whatever that means, another $215,000 on restaurants and food, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=229.04s)]
*  and get this, he took out more than $1.6 million in ATM withdrawals. In other words, Hunter was [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=238.16s)]
*  spending millions on quote drugs, escorts, girlfriends, luxury hotels, rental properties, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=245.68s)]
*  exotic cars, clothing, other items, all while dodging both taxes and child support payments. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=251.84s)]
*  But in a newly released podcast, Hunter, well, he tells the world that he and his father, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=258.56s)]
*  they are victims. A vast right-wing conspiracy is now back. According to Hunter, Republicans [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=264.16s)]
*  are trying to kill him. Take a listen. They're trying to destroy a presidency. And so it's not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=270.24s)]
*  about me. And their most base way, what they're trying to do is they're trying to kill me, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=278.24s)]
*  knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle. And so therefore, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  destroying a presidency in that way. Poor Hunter, how dare those Republicans demand, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=294.0s)]
*  oh, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws. The president's what? They [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=299.44s)]
*  shouldn't have to pay taxes or follow the law. Well, I guess not if you're a Biden. Until now, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=305.84s)]
*  the Bidens have been able to do pretty much whatever they want. Now, the country just [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  spent four, what, hysteria-filled years on Trump-Russia collusion, the witch hunt that never [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=316.0s)]
*  happened, that went nowhere, all lies, all conspiracy theories. But Hunter takes millions [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  from the first lady of Moscow. That's right. Millions of dollars. And no one bats an eyelash. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  Nobody. He takes millions from members of the Chinese Communist Party and the media mob. Oh, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=335.28s)]
*  no questions from them. As vice president, we know Joe Biden interacts with Hunter's business [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=341.52s)]
*  partners on a regular basis. We learned that this week through phone calls, through emails, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=347.12s)]
*  through golf outings and dinners. And what? Nobody sees a problem. According to John Solomon, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  there were at least six suspicious activity reports detailing a whopping $12 million [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=358.24s)]
*  in wire payments to Joe Biden's Delaware home. What? Nobody on the left, nobody in the media [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=364.48s)]
*  has anything to say. By the way, where is Adam Schiff or Eric Swalwell or Liz Cheney or Fake News [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=370.24s)]
*  CNN or MSDNC or the New York Times or the Washington Post? They accused Trump of being a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=377.12s)]
*  Russian plant for four long years. Then they elect a guy who is credibly accused of peddling [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=383.04s)]
*  the Biden brand to every sketchy oligarch in the world, including Russian oligarchs. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=390.0s)]
*  Now, clearly there is a political rot in our government, our media, our justice system today. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=396.56s)]
*  It's now been exposed for all to see. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkCvhUz6yCg&t=404.16s)]
