# I think they’ll ‘replace’ Biden: Sen. Lindsey Graham
**Fox News:** [July 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo)
*  Joining us with his reaction, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Graham, let me put that question right to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=4.48s)]
*  If the man that we see in front of us on the screen cannot handle an answer to an obvious [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  debate question, feet away from Donald Trump, how can he handle being the commander-in-chief [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=12.9s)]
*  of our armed forces, feet away from world leaders who don't exactly always like America? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=18.36s)]
*  How does he absorb what's going on in the world, given what we saw in the debate? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=24.88s)]
*  Our enemies are watching that debate. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=31.28s)]
*  I'm very worried about what they took away from this debate. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=33.16s)]
*  If you're Iran, do you really push before November to get a nuclear weapon, thinking [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=36.56s)]
*  that Biden's compromised? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=40.8s)]
*  The bottom line here, this is a very dangerous time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  When President Trump told our enemies, I'm watch what you're doing here, don't take [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=46.08s)]
*  advantage of this situation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=50.78s)]
*  I hope our enemies are listening. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=52.919999999999995s)]
*  But 76% of the American public believe that Joe Biden is not capable, mentally, of having [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=55.08s)]
*  the job. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=61.059999999999995s)]
*  If you're a Democratic senator in these contests, Joe Biden is going to sink you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=62.4s)]
*  I think they'll replace him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=67.96s)]
*  I think it's going to be abundantly obvious you cannot convince the American people this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=69.74s)]
*  guy can serve another four years, that he's not mentally with it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=74.56s)]
*  The world is too dangerous to have him in the commander-in-chief chair. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=78.56s)]
*  So I think there's going to be a real move here soon to replace him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=83.06s)]
*  But here's what I want you to know. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=86.8s)]
*  You may change the name of the person, but they all have the same policies. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=88.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  That's what's important. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  I think it's not just the energy, but the policies. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  And trying to convince us for years now that Joe Biden is some kind of secret trapeze artist [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=96.88s)]
*  or triathlete behind the scenes, nobody's buying it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=101.84s)]
*  Senator, I wanted to ask you something I asked Congressman Donalds just a segment or two [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=105.56s)]
*  ago. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=109.72s)]
*  Do you see anybody in the Democratic Party in the United States Senate with whom you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=110.72s)]
*  serve who's actually willing to stand up and be maybe the first or second person to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=113.96s)]
*  say, Joe, you got to go? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=117.76s)]
*  I think you're going to see more and more of that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=120.88s)]
*  If you're Tester in Montana, you're Brown in Ohio, you're Jackie Rosen in Nevada, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=122.48s)]
*  you're Bob Casey, you're going to be asked until the cows come home, do you think Joe [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  Biden's fit to serve four more years? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you think he's mentally capable of being commander in chief? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=134.56s)]
*  And 70 percent of the people in those states say he's not. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=137.2s)]
*  So you're going to be running against the headwinds of the folks in your own state. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=140.96s)]
*  I think that we need the tapes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=146.16s)]
*  Did he have a cold? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=149.56s)]
*  Does that explain his behavior on that night? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=150.96s)]
*  Or is it deeper? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=154.12s)]
*  Is it what Carl Bernstein said, it's been a long time in the making? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=155.12s)]
*  Had they been lying to us for over a year? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=158.16s)]
*  So remember when the special counsel interviewed President Biden and they concluded they would [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=160.48s)]
*  have a hard time convicting him because the jury would believe he's a nice man with a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=165.8s)]
*  bad memory? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=170.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=171.6s)]
*  I want those tapes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=172.6s)]
*  I want to hear those tapes because that will that will be a good comparison as to whether [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=173.6s)]
*  or not it was a cold or has this been a continuous problem or they withholding information to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=179.12s)]
*  the American people to make a good judgment about should Biden serve four more years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=184.04s)]
*  I want to hear those tapes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=188.96s)]
*  I don't think this is a cold. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=190.76s)]
*  I think this is a problem been in the making for over a year and they've been lying to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=192.24s)]
*  us and covering up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=196.24s)]
*  We deserve to know Senator Robert Herb released the tapes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=197.76s)]
*  I know people of power trying to get those tapes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=200.2s)]
*  Just quickly, Senator, you serve with Kamala Harris in the Senate and on the Judiciary [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  Committee. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=206.04s)]
*  Is she up to the job of president? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=207.04s)]
*  I think all of her instincts are bad when it comes to making a safe and prosperous. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=209.96s)]
*  She's capable physically, but her policy choices are horrible. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=214.84s)]
*  A nightmare for the American people if she gets to be president of the United States. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=219.4s)]
*  Take it to the bank, folks, because Senator Graham has spent more time with her than the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=223.4s)]
*  rest of us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=226.16s)]
*  She's turned the vice presidency into a no-show job. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=227.16s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1bWDAl2Moo&t=229.68s)]
