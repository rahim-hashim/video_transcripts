# Trump: Kamala Harris has the ‘ideology of a communist’
**Fox News:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI)
*  Is there rhetoric put in your life in jeopardy? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=0.0s)]
*  Further jeopardy? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=3.0s)]
*  I can't—look, you have a lot of very— [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=7.0s)]
*  Deranged people in this country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=10.0s)]
*  You have a lot of— [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=11.0s)]
*  And assassination squads. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=12.0s)]
*  You have a lot of deranged people. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=13.0s)]
*  I looked at the two that we're talking about. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=14.0s)]
*  I'm disappointed that the FBI hasn't opened up some of these phones. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=16.0s)]
*  And one guy had six phones, and the other one had three apps. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=21.0s)]
*  And two of the three apps, supposedly, were foreign-based. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=24.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe there was something, too. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=27.0s)]
*  They should be looking at it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=29.0s)]
*  They should be opening up those phones. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=30.0s)]
*  Why haven't they opened up the six phones? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=32.0s)]
*  And why haven't they opened up the three apps? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=34.0s)]
*  So the first one had three apps, and I think they were encrypted, and it was—they were foreign. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=37.0s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=44.0s)]
*  These were foreign apps. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=45.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you think they'd be opening them up? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=47.0s)]
*  We need to answer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=50.0s)]
*  It's a strange—look, we have a strange situation going on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=51.0s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=54.0s)]
*  I don't think there's ever been a president that's had more support and strong support than I have. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=55.0s)]
*  When you mentioned Madison Square Garden before, everybody said, you can't do—how are you going to ever fill up Madison Square Garden? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=61.0s)]
*  I said, well, I filled up the Nassau Coliseum, and it's almost the same size, and we could have filled it up three or four times. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=68.0s)]
*  I mean, the crowds there were the same thing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=76.0s)]
*  And when I saw that, I said, let's go for Madison Square Garden. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=78.0s)]
*  New Jersey wasn't that small. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=81.0s)]
*  You've had a number of big rallies. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=82.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=84.0s)]
*  New Jersey was—yeah, New Jersey was 107,000 people. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=85.0s)]
*  If you were president and your opponent was being targeted in our country by Iranian assassination squads and you're president, what would you do? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=88.0s)]
*  I would tell them—and even if I didn't like my opponent, they can't love me because I'm very critical of them, but I'm critical for a reason, because they don't know what they're doing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=101.0s)]
*  Look, we have wars. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=110.0s)]
*  The Middle East is blowing up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=111.0s)]
*  Ukraine would have never been attacked by Russia if I were president. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=113.0s)]
*  October 7th would have never happened in Israel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=116.0s)]
*  All those people would be alive. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=119.0s)]
*  We wouldn't have had inflation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=120.0s)]
*  We would have had Afghanistan, the most embarrassing day in our history. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=122.0s)]
*  It would never have taken place like that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=126.0s)]
*  We would have kept to Bagram because it was one hour—the biggest air force base, one of the biggest in the world. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=129.0s)]
*  We gave it up to China. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=134.0s)]
*  China occupies it now, not Afghanistan. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=135.0s)]
*  We gave it up to China. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=138.0s)]
*  One hour away from where China builds its nuclear weapons. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=139.0s)]
*  Wouldn't it be a great thing if we had that? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=142.0s)]
*  We walked away. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=144.0s)]
*  We have incompetent people running our country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=145.0s)]
*  They're very dangerous people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=148.0s)]
*  They're dangerous because they're incompetent. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=149.0s)]
*  She's grossly incompetent. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=152.0s)]
*  Plus, she's a radical left person. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=153.0s)]
*  And any person that has her ideology—I mean, you could go through her ideology. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=156.0s)]
*  It's the ideology of a communist. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=161.0s)]
*  And this country is not ready for that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=163.0s)]
*  And I don't think it ever will be. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=165.0s)]
*  If it is, we're in big trouble. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=167.0s)]
*  Let's go to your closing arguments. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=169.0s)]
*  McDonald's, Al Smith dinner, three hours on Joe Rogan, your rallies at Madison Square Garden. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=172.0s)]
*  I've known you a long time, long before you ever decided to get into this crazy political world that you're in. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=181.0s)]
*  I think I know you well enough to see that you're having a lot of fun. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=187.0s)]
*  It's a lot at stake, but I can tell that you are definitely having a good time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=192.0s)]
*  Am I wrong? Am I perception? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=197.0s)]
*  Not only are you right when you say that—when you say good time, it's hard to say, I'm having a good time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=199.0s)]
*  Because, you know, yesterday I did three rallies. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=208.0s)]
*  But when you're in front of a crowd— [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=211.0s)]
*  I've gone 58 days in a row, no days off. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=213.0s)]
*  I'm amazed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=215.0s)]
*  She's taken two days off in the last few days. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=217.0s)]
*  I said, you know, you're getting down—I think it was down to, like, we were down to 14 days, and she was taking days off all the time. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=219.0s)]
*  And, you know, she only does—she'll do, like, one little event, and they don't get any people at their events. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=226.0s)]
*  You know, they bust some men. I don't bust anybody. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=232.0s)]
*  They bust some men. They don't get people. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=234.0s)]
*  And when they leave, you saw Beyoncé. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=236.0s)]
*  They came in to see Beyoncé. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=238.0s)]
*  Beyoncé didn't sing. They all left. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=240.0s)]
*  And she's standing there making a speech. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=242.0s)]
*  There was nobody there, and everybody was screaming and cursing because of what happened. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=244.0s)]
*  Look, we have a real campaign. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=248.0s)]
*  This is a movement like we've never had in this country. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=250.0s)]
*  And it's not a question of, am I having a good time? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=254.0s)]
*  I think we're making tremendous progress. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=258.0s)]
*  We have to save the country. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=260.0s)]
*  Our country—we are a nation in decline. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=262.0s)]
*  I say it, we're a nation in serious decline. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=264.0s)]
*  And we can't go through another four years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=266.0s)]
*  I don't think we could go through another year like this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=268.0s)]
*  We have criminals coming into our country at a level that's never been seen before. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=270.0s)]
*  And to me, the biggest thing—I know the polls say the economy and inflation and everything, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=276.0s)]
*  but—and the border is number three. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=280.0s)]
*  I think the border is number one. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=283.0s)]
*  For a really great American, the border is number one, because we're allowing tens of thousands— [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=285.0s)]
*  think of it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=291.0s)]
*  We just announced the Border Patrol, which is so great. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=292.0s)]
*  They did things which they've never done before. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=295.0s)]
*  They announced last week how many of different crimes are coming in. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=298.0s)]
*  They said 13,099—exact—murderers, people that murdered people that were in jail, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=302.0s)]
*  have been released into our country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=308.0s)]
*  They said 16,000 drug lords, drug dealers. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=311.0s)]
*  I mean, everything's exactly detailed on—they never did that before. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=314.0s)]
*  They never—they announced the total, but they wouldn't say what the crimes were. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=318.0s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=322.0s)]
*  They've released over 13,000 convicted killers. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=323.0s)]
*  Many of them killed far more than one person. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=328.0s)]
*  And they're now roaming the fields of our country. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=331.0s)]
*  We made America great. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=333.0s)]
*  And now we're going to make America great again. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=335.0s)]
*  We're going to make it great again. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=337.0s)]
*  And we have the formula. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=339.0s)]
*  It's down pat. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=340.0s)]
*  This country, we're going to have jobs. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=342.0s)]
*  We're going to have countries pouring back into our country. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=344.0s)]
*  You're going to see something. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=346.0s)]
*  And now I know everybody in Washington. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=348.0s)]
*  I didn't know anybody. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=350.0s)]
*  I was not a Washington person. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=352.0s)]
*  I was rarely there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=353.0s)]
*  I know everybody. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=355.0s)]
*  I know the good, the strong, the weak, the stupid. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=356.0s)]
*  I know everybody. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=359.0s)]
*  And we're going to make this country great again. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=361.0s)]
*  And we have to save our country. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=364.0s)]
*  If they won this election, our country is finished. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=366.0s)]
*  She's going to raise everybody's taxes. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=372.0s)]
*  Every company is going to move out of America. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=374.0s)]
*  We're not going to have any—she would force them out of America. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=377.0s)]
*  She doesn't know what she's doing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=380.0s)]
*  She's not a smart person. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=381.0s)]
*  And she doesn't know what she's doing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=383.0s)]
*  We're going to use certain things against other countries that have taken advantage of us, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=385.0s)]
*  having to do with the most beautiful word in the dictionary called tariff. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=390.0s)]
*  And we're going to make so much money in this country. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=394.0s)]
*  We're going to pay off our debt. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=397.0s)]
*  We're going to do things that nobody thought possible. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=398.0s)]
*  It's going to happen all quickly. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=400.0s)]
*  I'm going to make a prediction. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=402.0s)]
*  Your threat of tariffs is going to prevent them from putting tariffs on us. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=403.0s)]
*  So, in Mexico, which is a real threat to us, by the way, in two ways. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=407.0s)]
*  They're killing hundreds of thousands of people by letting fentanyl, another thing, come through our border. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=412.0s)]
*  We should stop it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=419.0s)]
*  I had it stopped. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=420.0s)]
*  I had it very close to stopped. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=421.0s)]
*  I had the strongest border in history. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=422.0s)]
*  Now we have the worst border in the history of the world. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=424.0s)]
*  I had the strongest border. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=427.0s)]
*  The day you saw the chart, the day I left office, I had the strongest border in the history of our country. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=428.0s)]
*  Now we have the worst border ever in the world. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=434.0s)]
*  There's never been a border in the world where 21 million people were allowed to come across almost at one time. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=436.0s)]
*  It's crazy what we're doing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=443.0s)]
*  But we're going to have a country that's going to be strong and respected again. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=446.0s)]
*  We're going to have a country where the taxes are going down, where the quality of life is going up. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=449.0s)]
*  We're going to have a country. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=454.0s)]
*  They don't respect us. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=455.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=457.0s)]
*  I went to Abe of Japan, Shinzo. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=458.0s)]
*  He was a great friend. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=461.0s)]
*  He was assassinated. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=462.0s)]
*  He was a great gentleman. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=464.0s)]
*  I said, Shinzo, your deal with us is horrible. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=465.0s)]
*  He said, I know you were going to come. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=469.0s)]
*  I said, what do you mean? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=472.0s)]
*  He said, I knew at some point you would come. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=474.0s)]
*  For 25 years, nobody came. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=477.0s)]
*  He said, no American ever came to renegotiate the deal. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=479.0s)]
*  I knew you were going to do it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=482.0s)]
*  And I renegotiated the deal. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=484.0s)]
*  And I was stuck with a bad deal to start off with. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=485.0s)]
*  We had a bad deal with Japan. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=487.0s)]
*  This is Japan. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=488.0s)]
*  But I renegotiated with South Korea with this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=489.0s)]
*  Now, don't forget, I'm negotiating from a bad place because they have these deals that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=493.0s)]
*  were made by people that were either really stupid or corrupt. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=497.0s)]
*  They had to be corrupt to make these deals. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=501.0s)]
*  We have the worst trade deals. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=503.0s)]
*  I was fixing these trade deals. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=505.0s)]
*  I was taking care of our country. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=507.0s)]
*  But the bottom line is this. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=509.0s)]
*  We're going to be respected again. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=510.0s)]
*  We're going to make America great again. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=512.0s)]
*  And there's nothing in the world I'd rather be doing. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=513.0s)]
*  I don't want to be in some beautiful beach. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=516.0s)]
*  I don't want to be sitting in some faraway hotel where it's very nice and watching television [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=517.0s)]
*  or doing something. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=525.0s)]
*  I want to be doing what I'm doing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=526.0s)]
*  It's so incredible. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=527.0s)]
*  We've made such. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=528.0s)]
*  And this is a movement. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=529.0s)]
*  By the way, this isn't this is a movement maybe like the world has never seen. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=530.0s)]
*  Mega. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=534.0s)]
*  Make America great again. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=535.0s)]
*  The world has never seen a movement like this. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=536.0s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=539.0s)]
*  We're leading everything. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=541.0s)]
*  We're against the opposition. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=542.0s)]
*  And the opposition is also the fake news media. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=544.0s)]
*  They're terrible. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=545.0s)]
*  Awful. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=546.0s)]
*  So we're not going to have the Americans won't have to settle as the Washington Post [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=547.0s)]
*  suggests. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=549.0s)]
*  You may have to lower your expectations. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=550.0s)]
*  It sounded a lot like Jimmy Carter telling America to put on a sweater. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=551.0s)]
*  Look, we're not going to lower expectations and get a townhouse instead of a real house [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=552.0s)]
*  with a backyard where you could have a dog and you could actually we should have higher [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=553.0s)]
*  aspirations. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=554.0s)]
*  Wouldn't oil be that it would neutralize Putin's [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=555.0s)]
*  It would neutralize Iran and it would make America rich. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=569.34s)]
*  Interest rates are coming down big. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=578.7s)]
*  Energy prices are coming down. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=581.88s)]
*  I'm going to have everybody's energy bill from a year from January 20th when you take [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=583.84s)]
*  office cut in half. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=588.22s)]
*  When that happens, everything else comes down with it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=590.7800000000001s)]
*  Oil is so big. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=593.26s)]
*  It's so important. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=594.26s)]
*  And everything's going to come down. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=596.1s)]
*  We're going to have inexpensive energy. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=599.06s)]
*  We're going to have companies moving to our country at record at record clips because [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=601.02s)]
*  otherwise they're going to have to pay to do business with our country. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=607.2199999999999s)]
*  And you don't have to pay if you build your plant inside our country and you hire our [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=610.8199999999999s)]
*  workers. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=614.54s)]
*  We are going to have a country the likes of which and we were getting there. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=615.8s)]
*  We were very close. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=618.7399999999999s)]
*  Look, I had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=619.7399999999999s)]
*  I met with two pollsters, McLaughlin and Fabrizio. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=622.7399999999999s)]
*  They said, if George Washington came back from the dead and he brought along Abraham [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=626.34s)]
*  Lincoln as his vice president, they couldn't beat you, sir. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=632.9s)]
*  And then two days later, we had the period of time where we had the COVID. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=636.7s)]
*  Trump says he beat Lincoln and Washington combined. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=640.5s)]
*  They said it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=642.98s)]
*  I mean, they said it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=643.98s)]
*  So if you get back to the White House, I get the first interview, right? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=644.98s)]
*  You have a deal. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=649.7800000000001s)]
*  No, you've been a great friend. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E479RswkKeI&t=650.7800000000001s)]
