# Hannity: Kamala’s border trip ‘reeks’ of political desperation
**Fox News:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI)
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=0.0s)]
*  This Friday night, we start tonight with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=1.0s)]
*  Three U.S. warships were attacked tonight while entering the Red Sea. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=3.56s)]
*  The American vessels were forced to intercept nearly two dozen missiles and drones, launched [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=7.92s)]
*  by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel militants. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=12.9s)]
*  We have a full report on this coming up with Trey Yank straight ahead. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Also tonight, three individuals with ties to Iran have been indicted in a plot against [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=25.78s)]
*  Also, Israel just delivered a massive major blow against the Ebola terrorists deep inside [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  Beirut. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=33.56s)]
*  And coming up, Trey Yank reports on all of it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=34.56s)]
*  He's on the ground in Israel tonight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=36.8s)]
*  But first, our top story. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=39.12s)]
*  With only 39 days until this inflection point of our country, and that means the election, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=40.68s)]
*  and nearly four years into her role as border czar, Kamala Harris has now figured out, and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  pretending she knows that she cares and has solutions for the crisis of her own doing, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  that she created at the border with Joe Biden. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=56.6s)]
*  Now, of course, this is all an act. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=59.0s)]
*  Her statements were obscene, absurd, dishonest, fake, phony, fraudulent. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=61.84s)]
*  And we're watching and witnessing one of the most dishonest presidential campaigns [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=66.68s)]
*  in American history, all aided and abetted by a complicit and abusively biased media. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=71.08s)]
*  Tonight's trip to the border reeks of nothing but political desperation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=77.32s)]
*  But according to Kamala, she has finally found, after three and a half plus long years of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=81.2s)]
*  looking, the root cause of illegal immigration. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  And she knows how to fix it, although she wants more bureaucrats to process more fake [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=90.12s)]
*  asylum claims to allow more illegal immigrants into the country. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's a genius idea. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=98.92s)]
*  And one more agent for every five miles. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=101.28s)]
*  What a genius. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=103.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=104.8s)]
*  So I've just come from visiting the border in the port of entry in Douglas. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=105.8s)]
*  I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs Officers who every day [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=110.04s)]
*  see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  keep our nation secure. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  And they need more resources to do their jobs. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=129.56s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=134.0s)]
*  But she's been telling us for three and a half years, no, the border is secure. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=135.0s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=138.0s)]
*  In other words, she wants the federal government to facilitate an even greater volume of illegal [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=139.24s)]
*  immigrants quickly dumping them into your town, your city, all across the country without [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=144.64s)]
*  all the burdensome, chaotic scenes at the border. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=150.32s)]
*  That is her plan pretty much in a nutshell. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=154.0s)]
*  Not only will it not work, it is completely insane, which brings us to a quick Hannity [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=156.16s)]
*  history lesson, shall we? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=160.64s)]
*  Four years ago, Kamala Harris inherited the most secure border on record. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=162.64s)]
*  And as president, Donald Trump made it a top priority to implement enhanced security measures. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  He's called racist and all sorts of names for doing so. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=172.64s)]
*  But that included miles and miles of new border wall, new funding for Border Patrol, critical [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=176.28s)]
*  diplomatic agreements with multiple countries, especially Mexico. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=181.88s)]
*  State of Mexico policy may sound familiar, all to prevent illegal immigration at the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=187.04s)]
*  source. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=191.88s)]
*  But during their very first week in office, Joe Biden and Kamala, they repealed with the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=192.92s)]
*  stroke of a single pen all of those measures. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=197.44s)]
*  They repealed all of them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=201.6s)]
*  They bragged about repealing all of them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=203.12s)]
*  They even halted all ongoing border wall construction and got rid of the materials for pennies on [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=205.44s)]
*  the dollar, leaving millions of dollars worth of materials to rot and decay in other cases [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=211.68s)]
*  in the elements. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=216.84s)]
*  Just overnight, the border went from completely safe and secure to a full-blown crisis, the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=218.56s)]
*  likes of which this country has never seen. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=224.28s)]
*  Take a look at the chart. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=226.48s)]
*  Numbers don't lie. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=227.48s)]
*  Neither do scenes from the border that you can see with your own eyes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  And that is illegals—oh, yeah, camped underneath bridges, the shelters that are overwhelmed. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=232.8s)]
*  Oh, remember the kids in Harris-Biden cages at the height of COVID overcrowded, a border [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  totally overrun by millions of unvetted illegal immigrants from over 180 countries. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=245.72s)]
*  Many were terrorized, some of our top geopolitical foes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=251.4s)]
*  No documentation, no identification. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=254.88s)]
*  And that was just the beginning of what is now a full-blown national security public [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=257.44s)]
*  safety crisis for everyone in this country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=262.92s)]
*  They have known suspected terrorists. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=266.1s)]
*  Yeah, they have flooded into our country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure many are plotting and planning and scheming an attack on our country. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=270.04s)]
*  Traffickers, drug traffickers at levels we've never seen before as a country, fentanyl deaths, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  overdose deaths at record highs, violent gangs now. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=280.8s)]
*  They're taking over neighborhoods, towns, New York City, Chicago, schools, hospitals, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  affordable housing, all overwhelmed by the 11.5 that we know about, unvetted Harris-Biden [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=289.56s)]
*  illegal immigrants, countless numbers of American citizens. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=299.76s)]
*  They have been murdered. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=300.76s)]
*  They have been raped. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  They have been victims of other horrific crimes, all by Harris-Biden unvetted violent [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=303.24s)]
*  criminals who never should have been allowed into your country, but are because of them [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=309.04s)]
*  and their stupidity. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  And then they're lying about, oh, the border's secure, border's closed, border's secure, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=317.48s)]
*  border's closed. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=321.36s)]
*  But they have blood on their hands as a result. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=322.6s)]
*  Think of Maryland Mother of Five, Rachel Moore, brutally beaten, brutally raped, stuffed into [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=325.52s)]
*  a drainpipe by a Harris-Biden unvetted illegal immigrant who abducted, murdered her along [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=330.44s)]
*  with her—along a popular hiking trail. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=336.24s)]
*  Then you've got this young Houston girl, 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungary. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=339.6s)]
*  We had her mother and grandfather right here on this program raped and brutalized for two [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=345.64s)]
*  hours by two unvetted Harris-Biden illegal immigrants. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=349.64s)]
*  They dumped her body in a river. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  You have a nursing student by the name of Lake and Riley. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=355.88s)]
*  Remember her? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=359.0s)]
*  She was murdered by an illegal immigrant along a running trail near the University of Georgia. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=360.64s)]
*  And look at all the other names of victims. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=364.28s)]
*  Look at these names. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=366.38s)]
*  It goes on, dozens and dozens and dozens of Americans rape, murdered victims of violent [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=367.38s)]
*  crimes because of their wide-open borders. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=373.04s)]
*  And breaking today, a scary new report. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=376.24s)]
*  The director of ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirming to FoxNews.com that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=379.04s)]
*  more than 13,000 Harris-Biden illegal immigrants who are convicted of murder are now roaming [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=385.28s)]
*  around your country. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=391.0s)]
*  13,000 murderers on the loose inside our country, along with an additional 2,000 with pending [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  murder charges. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=398.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, more than 15,000 convicted rapists, sex offenders, are also in your country illegally. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=399.52s)]
*  And more than 2,500 kidnappers are on the loose, all told more than 400,000 criminal illegal [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=407.28s)]
*  immigrants, even those with terror ties, spread across America. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=414.32s)]
*  And you can thank your border czar, Kamala Harris, along with, what, let's see, another [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=417.92s)]
*  222,000 pending criminal charges. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=422.56s)]
*  Kamala did all of that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=426.44s)]
*  She's the border czar. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=428.8s)]
*  She left these people, she let these people in. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  And make no mistake, this is beyond a dereliction of duty. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=432.36s)]
*  This is the most preventable, but yet vulnerable domestic security failure in the history of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=437.52s)]
*  this country. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=445.44s)]
*  Why did Kamala put so many American lives at risk? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  Why did she allow so many Americans to die, get raped, be victims of violent crime? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=451.4s)]
*  The answer, unfortunately, is pretty simple, is that Kamala represents a dangerous mix [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=457.03999999999996s)]

*  Take a look. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=479.2s)]
*  I am in favor of saying that we're not going to treat people who are undocumented across [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=480.2s)]

*  That's correct. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=485.32s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=486.32s)]
*  Also, I have the courage to reject that term, illegal alien. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=488.32s)]
*  I have seen some of the worst of criminal behavior. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=493.32s)]
*  I have seen the worst of crime. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=500.32s)]
*  An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=503.32s)]

*  An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=514.68s)]
*  Being an undocumented immigrant is not a crime. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=517.28s)]
*  No, it's a crime. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=520.68s)]

*  for anyone in the world that walks across this border. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=535.76s)]

*  Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=562.3000000000001s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=564.7800000000001s)]
*  to public safety, public education, or public health, period. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=571.98s)]
*  For the commander in chief to suggest that we have to build a wall across our southern [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=577.5s)]
*  border because there are terrorists who are trying to invade the country, it couldn't [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=583.9s)]
*  be farther from the truth. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=590.84s)]
*  On the subject of transnational gangs, let's be perfectly clear. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=592.34s)]
*  The president's medieval vanity project is not going to stop them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=597.62s)]
*  I believe if someone crosses over the border, it's illegally, it is illegal, and you would [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=602.0600000000001s)]
*  decriminalize it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=606.0600000000001s)]

*  It should be a civil enforcement issue. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=610.76s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question that we've got to critically reexamine ICE and its role [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=613.02s)]
*  and the way that it is being administered and the work it is doing, and we need to probably [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=618.18s)]
*  think about starting from scratch. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=621.82s)]
*  We have murderers, we have rapists, we have people with known terror ties, we have gangs, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=624.52s)]
*  we have drug traffickers, all that she has let in. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=629.92s)]
*  Oh, and we have Iranian assassins looking to kill Donald Trump. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=632.6s)]
*  As borders are, when Kamala's radical policies led to a full-blown crisis, she lied straight [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=636.0s)]
*  to your face. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=641.64s)]
*  She acted like it's not happening. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=643.0s)]
*  The border's secure. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=644.4s)]
*  She looked at scenes like the ones you're looking at right there and flat out told you, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=646.26s)]
*  no, this isn't happening. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=650.68s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=652.34s)]
*  She told you over and over again. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=654.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=655.88s)]
*  Would you call the border secure? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=656.88s)]
*  I think that there is no question that we have to do what the president and I asked [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=660.0s)]
*  Congress to do. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=666.08s)]
*  The first request we made, pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=667.24s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  You're confident this border's secure? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=676.72s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=680.36s)]
*  our administration. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=688.36s)]
*  For three and a half years, she flat out refused to even visit the southern border as borders [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=689.36s)]
*  are to see the crisis up close and personal and firsthand. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=695.52s)]
*  After all, why go to the border? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=700.24s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=702.08s)]
*  If you haven't been to Europe, why would you go to the border? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=703.08s)]
*  You decide. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=707.84s)]
*  The notion that the border is closed. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=709.72s)]
*  Why should they believe you when they know that people are getting in? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=712.48s)]
*  Well, Lester, here's the thing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  I've been working on this issue for a very long time. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=717.96s)]
*  Do you have any plans to visit the border? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=721.48s)]
*  I'm here in Guatemala today at some point. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=725.88s)]
*  We are going to the border. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=731.36s)]
*  We've been to the border. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=732.36s)]
*  So this whole thing about the border, we've been to the border. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  We've been to the border. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=738.6s)]
*  But you haven't been to the border. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  And I haven't been to Europe. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=741.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't understand the point that you're making. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=743.76s)]
*  I haven't been to Europe either. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=750.6800000000001s)]
*  Europe, get ready. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=752.2s)]
*  She's probably on her way. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=753.52s)]
*  After lying about the border crisis for years, pretending it wasn't a real crisis, terrible [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=755.0400000000001s)]

*  day. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=766.28s)]
*  She wasn't actually willing to put in the work to fix the wide open southern border. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=767.28s)]
*  Instead, she tried to blame or pass the blame, actually blame Donald Trump, who gave her [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=771.16s)]
*  the most secure border in history. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=776.8s)]
*  But you know, when all else fails and the dog bites and the bee stings and you're [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=778.9599999999999s)]
*  feeling sad and you left the border wide open, just blame Trump. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=783.48s)]
*  Easy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=787.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=788.72s)]
*  We do have a broken immigration system. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  And it needs to be fixed. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=792.92s)]
*  And if we take a step back, months ago, some of the most conservative members of the United [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=794.24s)]
*  States Congress came together with others, proposed a border security bill. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=798.72s)]
*  Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=803.36s)]
*  run on and told them to kill the bill, don't put it up for a vote. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=807.92s)]
*  He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution because he wants to run on [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=811.4s)]
*  a problem instead of fixing a problem. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=814.28s)]
*  OK, let me, this lie needs to be debunked. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=817.32s)]
*  This was never a border security bill, one of the dumbest bills in history. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=822.32s)]
*  It was blocked by Senate Republicans because it did nothing to secure the border. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=826.0400000000001s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it wouldn't even kick in until four or five thousand illegals actually [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=831.0s)]
*  crossed into the country illegally. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=835.12s)]
*  And then they had the discretion whether to enforce it or not, which would codify what [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=837.32s)]
*  they've been doing into law. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=841.48s)]
*  It enabled, it encouraged the illegal immigration by reducing wait times at the border for illegals. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=843.46s)]
*  So again, codified open borders into law. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=849.88s)]
*  That was not a border security bill. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=853.42s)]
*  Now, the photo op in Douglas, Arizona today is nothing but a slap in the face to every [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=855.2s)]
*  American. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=860.4s)]

*  Why do you think she's here? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=882.76s)]
*  Uh, cause she's the flip flopper and she's trying to get some votes at the last minute. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=884.8399999999999s)]

*  What would you tell her? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=899.7399999999999s)]
*  I'd say, about time you visited the border, let me show you what it's really like. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=900.7399999999999s)]
*  It's all publicity. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=906.32s)]
*  It's kind of like she's here. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=909.32s)]
*  She doesn't care. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITe9xbtuXqI&t=912.84s)]
