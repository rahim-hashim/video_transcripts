# Voters think Kamala Harris is ‘more to the left’ of Biden: Mark Penn
**Fox News:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ)
*  All right, here with reaction pollster Matt Towery of Insider Advantage and Harris Poll [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=0.0s)]
*  chairman Mark Penn is with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=5.48s)]
*  Matt, start with you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=7.04s)]
*  I found those headlines, especially Reuters, New York Times, not exactly conservative outlets. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=9.36s)]
*  Those dials were interesting as well. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=15.6s)]
*  And I spoke to two other pollsters today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=18.0s)]
*  They said they got the same reaction. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=21.16s)]
*  So there seems to be widespread consensus on that issue. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=28.12s)]
*  Well, I think it's pretty clear. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it was not Trump's best debate. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  We know that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=33.52s)]
*  But it didn't hurt him at all. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=34.52s)]
*  Apparently, we had a poll that Robert Cahaly and I did last night during the debate and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=36.08s)]
*  afterwards it showed undecideds didn't move as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=40.28s)]
*  And I want to mention this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=43.32s)]
*  I'm in the field in Michigan. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=44.32s)]
*  And in 2020, Insider Advantage had the best, the most accurate numbers in Michigan of the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  final five in the Real Clear Politics Average. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=51.64s)]
*  I don't have the final numbers, but I can look at them enough to tell you right now [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=53.92s)]
*  Trump is either even or ahead in Michigan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=58.08s)]
*  And if that's the case, then whatever boost she gets from this debate is going to be short-lived [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=60.08s)]
*  if she gets one at all. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=64.6s)]
*  Let me ask you, Mark Penn. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=66.8s)]
*  I have worried that some of Kamala's radical positions, like no restrictions, even late-term [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=68.72s)]
*  abortions, mandatory gun buyback, no border wall, decriminalize illegal immigration, free [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=75.4s)]
*  education, and now taxpayer-funded sex change surgery for illegals and for convicted felons. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=82.84s)]
*  Her sponsorship of the $93 trillion Green New Deal, she would literally eliminate the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=93.08s)]
*  filibuster. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=98.94s)]
*  I would argue that's the end of capitalism, eliminating private insurance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=99.94s)]
*  Again, her bill she supported, government-run healthcare. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=103.56s)]
*  You can't say radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=107.48s)]
*  You can't say illegal alien. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  All the taxes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=111.32s)]
*  I would have been worried that that's not permeating into the consciousness of the American [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=113.16s)]
*  people fast enough, especially with early voting. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=118.63999999999999s)]
*  Now, when I hear independence and watch independence on dials like that, I begin to think people [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=122.16s)]
*  really are starting to get it in spite of a media blackout. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=131.76s)]
*  Am I wrong in my analysis? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=135.6s)]
*  Well, you're not wrong in your analysis because we asked in the polls pretty much, what do [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=139.28s)]
*  you think Kamala Harris's views are? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=146.12s)]
*  And they guessed more correctly than you would think. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  They think she is more for open borders and policies and that she is more to the left [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=151.68s)]
*  of Biden. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  So I think some of this stuff is really sinking in and it's raising questions. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=158.28s)]
*  And that's why you have a bunch of undefided voters who are not moving that quickly until [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  they hear more about what she stands for and particularly more about the economy because [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=168.2s)]
*  most undecided voters, they're not voting on immigration or abortion. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=174.04s)]
*  They're really deciding on the economy and who they think will be a better president [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=179.0s)]
*  who will make things better for their own lives. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=187.16s)]
*  I mean, how do you sponsor the Green New Deal? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=188.16s)]
*  Co-sponsor it with Bernie. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=192.32s)]
*  How do you co-sponsor government healthcare for all, universal healthcare, eliminate private [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=193.84s)]
*  insurance? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=198.06s)]
*  How do you, how do you want to decriminalize illegal immigration, free housing, healthcare [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=199.06s)]
*  education and sex change operations? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=204.86s)]
*  And is there any way voters won't know those views before the election? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=208.58s)]
*  How do you separate yourself as she seems to be trying to do by not talking very much [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=214.58s)]
*  about them? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=219.12s)]
*  Mark. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=221.16s)]
*  Well, so far she's been pretty successful at keeping those views behind the scenes. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=223.5s)]
*  And also, I think the Trump campaign hasn't really created an emotional reason why those [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=231.70000000000002s)]
*  views matter to the voters. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=238.26000000000002s)]
*  When I did the 3 a.m. ad, I made commander in chief relevant to the voters and everybody [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  then voted on that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  And so they're kind of getting the sense maybe she's too far to the left, but maybe [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=249.6s)]
*  not. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=254.68s)]
*  They're not really sure. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=255.68s)]
*  But Trump hasn't really been able to drive that difference. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=257.0s)]
*  And last night, they didn't give him a chance to do that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=260.6s)]
*  And let me just, let me just add, by the way, when the refs are not fair, the score of a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=264.2s)]
*  game generally doesn't count. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=269.88s)]
*  What do you think, Matt? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=273.56s)]
*  Well, I think this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=275.36s)]
*  I think the Trump campaign and their messaging. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=277.32s)]
*  I watch their ads. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=279.2s)]
*  I think they're pretty good, actually. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=280.2s)]
*  I think the problem that the Republicans have is all these other PACs that are raising all [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=281.64s)]
*  this money in the name of Donald Trump, they're running mediocre ads. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=285.24s)]
*  They don't hit on any of the points you're talking about, Sean. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=289.4s)]
*  Trump cannot do this on his own. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=293.2s)]
*  I mean, there are super PACs all over this country helping the Democrats, big money. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=294.48s)]
*  Somebody's got to get the messaging down for Trump other than just Trump, because he can't [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=298.96s)]
*  do it all on his own. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=303.8s)]
*  I think the campaign's doing a pretty good job, to be honest with you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=304.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=307.76s)]
*  I appreciate both of you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=308.76s)]
*  Mark Penn, thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=309.76s)]
*  Matt Towery, thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajbrNsy3_PQ&t=310.76s)]
