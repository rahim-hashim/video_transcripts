# Hannity: Biden is about to make the most consequential decisions of his presidency
**Fox News:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk)
*  But we begin tonight with this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=0.0s)]
*  It is time to stop funding the United Nations, the WHO, the WEF, get out of the climateâ€”Paris [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=1.56s)]
*  climate accords, and all these other globalist organizations. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=8.6s)]
*  Why are we supporting these groups? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=12.76s)]
*  Historically, the U.N., for example, has been anti-American, anti-Semitic. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=14.92s)]
*  The WHO was the propaganda wing of China during COVID, and now a new Israeli intelligence [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=19.76s)]
*  document spelling out very disturbing allegations against a dozen employees working for a U.N. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=26.6s)]
*  agency, the U.N. RWA, which, by the way, claims to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=33.44s)]
*  Now, according to the document, well, 12 employees took part in the October 7th Hamas terror [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=40.64s)]
*  attacks, including seven who stormed into Israeli territory or allegedly responsible [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=46.32s)]
*  for truly despicable acts. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=52.8s)]
*  And intelligence shared with the United States estimates that about 1,200 employees of this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=55.32s)]
*  agency have links to Hamas or the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=61.36s)]
*  In light of these allegations, the U.S. and many other countries, they have cut funding, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=67.24s)]
*  rightly so to the agency, which has sparked outrage from the radical left. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=72.12s)]
*  Even Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is calling for funding to be restored immediately. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=76.52s)]
*  And it's a shocker, as did Bernie Sanders, who said, quote, we cannot allow millions [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  to suffer because of the alleged actions of 12 people, echoing remarks from the White [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  House yesterday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=92.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=93.08s)]
*  Let's not impugn the good work of a whole agency because of the potential bad actions [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=94.08s)]
*  here by a small number. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=99.32s)]
*  I am not dismissing the seriousness of the allegations against those employees. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  And whether there's going to be more that will be found, hopefully the investigation [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=106.08s)]
*  will give us more insight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=109.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  This administration is once again a day late, dollar short. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  Now, since 2021, they have funneled more than one billion of your tax dollars to this agency. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  Back in 2018, former President Donald Trump, he cut all U.S. funding to the UNRWA. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  And once again, he's been proven right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=131.88s)]
*  Now, last night, the New York Post editorial board, they stepped up and they took it one [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=133.92s)]
*  little step further by calling for the U.S. to stop funding the United Nations altogether. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=138.76s)]
*  You know what? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=144.68s)]
*  I completely agree. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=145.68s)]
*  It is time for America to now take a stand, stop being a sucker nation, stop paying the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=146.88s)]
*  bulk of the freight, meaning your tax money, to organizations that don't even like us [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=153.64s)]
*  and basically side with our enemies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=159.12s)]
*  And that brings us to the country of Iran. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=161.88s)]
*  Joe Biden, your appeaser in chief, is about to make some of the most consequential decisions [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=164.12s)]
*  of his presidency. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=168.88s)]
*  There have now been at least 166 attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=170.56s)]
*  That's only since October 17th, all done by Iranian proxies. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=176.56s)]
*  So the big question is, what is Joe Biden going to do? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=181.6s)]
*  Will it be a typical meaningless response, a pinprick, like, you know, striking an empty [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  warehouse and claiming victory? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  Will the administration botch the response altogether? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=192.28s)]
*  Now according to new reports, officials are now worried about large-scale attacks on Americans [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=195.4s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=200.6s)]
*  Secretary Blinken added this yesterday. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=202.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=204.8s)]
*  I think it's very important to note that this is an incredibly volatile time in the Middle [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=205.8s)]
*  East. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=214.48s)]
*  I would argue that we have not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we're facing now [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=216.12s)]
*  across the region since at least 1973 and arguably even before that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  Americans, Mr. Blinken, are already under attack abroad. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=230.04s)]
*  This weekend we lost three brave soldiers and 40 others plus injured. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=235.52s)]
*  But still, this White House says there's no scheduled remarks addressing the vile [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=240.88s)]
*  attack. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=245.16s)]
*  Three American troops are dead, others injured. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=246.16s)]
*  Isn't it time we hear from the president? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=249.6s)]
*  But instead of addressing the nation, what is Joe doing today? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=251.84s)]
*  Oh, he spent the day campaigning in southern Florida. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  He could have come to visit me. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=259.18s)]
*  But before departing the White House, he offered another tepid, vague response. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=260.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=264.94s)]
*  That's not a response. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=275.04s)]
*  The administration's reaction to the deadly attack this weekend has been downright embarrassing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  Yesterday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre offered these very bizarre comments. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=295.44s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=300.92s)]
*  Three folks? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=302.92s)]
*  What you just heard is an utter embarrassment, a disgrace to those soldiers that died and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  frankly their families. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=332.2s)]
*  They did not die fighting for this administration. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=333.64s)]
*  They died because of this administration's weakness and incompetence. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=336.2s)]
*  That's what happened here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=340.88s)]
*  And the fact that they have allowed attack after attack after attack to go unanswered. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=342.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden is being slammed after John Kirby refused to say whether or not he would [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  attend the dignified transfer at Dover Air Force Base. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=351.62s)]
*  But maybe that's for the better. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  You may recall the last time he was there for a dignified transfer. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=357.44s)]
*  Remember the 13 Marines that died during his disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, remember, Joe was pretty bored. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=366.08s)]
*  He was checking his watch every two seconds. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=367.88s)]
*  Just in case you don't remember. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=370.55999999999995s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=371.55999999999995s)]
*  Well, apparently we don't have that cut. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=372.55999999999995s)]
*  I'm sorry about that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=379.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=380.52s)]
*  Now, I'm not advocating for foreign conflict. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=381.52s)]
*  I want to be very clear here. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  However, let me be very clear. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=384.76s)]
*  No one person, no country on this earth gets away or has the right to kill and or injure [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=387.46s)]
*  Americans abroad. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=395.34s)]
*  Now, if they attack you nearly 200 times, yes, that does warrant a fierce response, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=397.38s)]
*  one proportional to what it is they've been up to. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  If Joe Biden wants to show the world that he's serious, well, maybe he wants to take [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=409.65999999999997s)]
*  out Iran's refineries. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=413.97999999999996s)]
*  That is the main source of the Iranian mullahs money. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=415.74s)]
*  It's oil hidden where it hurts. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=419.38s)]
*  They are fast also approaching the ability to produce nuclear weapons. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=421.82s)]
*  And according to an IAEA report last month, they have undone the slowdown in enrichment [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=425.94s)]
*  of uranium to near weapons grade, but they face no consequences from Europe's are in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=432.58s)]
*  chief. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=438.22s)]
*  Joe Biden turned a blind eye to nearly 200 attacks against our military in Iraq and Syria, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=439.22s)]
*  leading up to what happened this past weekend. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=445.54s)]
*  He spent the better part of his presidency sucking up to Iran and helping the Iranian [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=447.82s)]
*  mullahs get rich. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=453.02000000000004s)]
*  Now, between reportedly turning a blind eye to their oil sales, you know, tens and tens [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=454.34000000000003s)]
*  and tens of billions of dollars for the mullahs to foment more terror and aid in a bet in [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=459.86s)]
*  terror wars and fighting proxy wars. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=466.54s)]
*  Remember, none of this happened under Donald Trump. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=469.26s)]
*  Joe offered them also $6 billion, the ransom payment for a prisoner swap, and then extended [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=471.98s)]
*  a waiver that allowed them to take in $10 billion from Iraq for electricity sales. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=477.42s)]
*  In other words, this administration has frankly opted for a policy of ass-kissing appeasement [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=483.7s)]
*  and sadly, the chaos, the destruction carried out by Iranian proxies was predictable. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=490.34s)]
*  This was all predictable. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=497.74s)]
*  How many times do you have to get attacked before, and your troops targeted, before you [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=499.62s)]
*  realize one of these attacks is going to kill people? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  This would never have happened if Joe Biden dealt with the nearly 200 previous attacks. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFCoQVGFMKk&t=508.5s)]
