# Karoline Leavitt: Trump is building the greatest political movement in history
**Fox News:** [December 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec)
*  is the next White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, and she will be the youngest person [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=0.0s)]
*  in United States history to assume that role. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=6.54s)]
*  Caroline, I cannot wait to see you behind that podium without a big stuffed binder of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=8.88s)]
*  nonsense. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=12.84s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=13.84s)]
*  I think it is so fascinating, Caroline. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=15.84s)]
*  You saw it happening a little bit during the campaign, but an awful lot since President [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=18.0s)]
*  Trump won. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=22.22s)]
*  So many people are falling out, ripping out their DEI programs, taking down references [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=23.22s)]
*  to January 6th on their websites and saying, we want to help the public sector, President [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=28.259999999999998s)]
*  Trump and his team, through the private sector, to get things done for the country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=33.86s)]
*  That's right, Kellyanne, and thanks for having me. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=40.86s)]
*  It's so great to be with you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=42.7s)]
*  And we really are witnessing President Trump build the greatest political movement in history. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=44.06s)]
*  The GOP is no longer a political party. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  It is a movement, a pro-America movement with Americans of all demographics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=52.5s)]
*  We saw President Trump win the election on November 5th with a resounding mandate. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=57.82s)]
*  He picked up support from historically Democrat demographics up across the board, and 70, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=62.42s)]
*  70 million forgotten men and women in this country made their vote and made their voices [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=67.78s)]
*  heard. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=73.22s)]
*  And that gave the courage of the billionaires in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street to finally [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=74.22s)]
*  express their open and public support for President Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=78.5s)]
*  And as President Trump has said, everybody wants to be his friend right now, and he's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=82.42s)]
*  okay with that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=86.7s)]
*  He is building a team of people from Wall Street to Main Street who want to make this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=88.58s)]
*  country great again and help him deliver on the promises that he made to the American [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=92.7s)]
*  people on the campaign trail, common-sense solutions to fix the problems in their lives, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  cutting taxes, ending inflation, securing the southern border, deporting illegal criminals, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=102.78s)]
*  rapists and murderers from our American communities, and using peace through strength to end the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=108.42s)]
*  chaos that we've seen the Harris Biden administration cause abroad. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=114.7s)]
*  It's truly a unifying message. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=118.34s)]
*  And as President Trump has repeatedly stated, this country will be unified through success, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=119.78s)]
*  and success is Donald Trump's number one goal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=125.54s)]
*  It's very obvious, Caroline, that President Trump has a lot of faith and trust in you [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=128.78s)]
*  to do this job of White House press secretary. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  Even though he communicates directly with the American people, he relies upon the people [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=134.78s)]
*  around him to do the same. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=139.26s)]
*  So let's picture you behind the podium for a moment, and you see the White House press [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=141.34s)]
*  corps in front of you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=144.78s)]
*  Will it look roughly the same in those rows? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=145.94s)]
*  And the reason I ask is, the whole media landscape is changing now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=148.02s)]
*  President Trump was able to leverage TikTok. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=151.86s)]
*  Instead of Bandit, he got on it, and it really helped him to disseminate his message to connect [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=154.5s)]
*  with young people, I think a plus-23% margin from before. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=160.78s)]
*  Also, all these new podcasts. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=164.34s)]
*  So as legacy media is trying to figure out its next move and survive all these changes, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  how do you see the White House press corps rows looking when you are peering out at them? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=173.94s)]
*  Well, three weeks from today, President Trump will be inaugurated, and I very much look [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=180.66s)]
*  forward to getting behind that podium. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  He has put together a team of exceptionally qualified individuals to serve in both the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=188.38s)]
*  White House and across the federal government in his Cabinet. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=193.06s)]
*  I'm so excited to get to work with my colleagues and my friends to make this country great [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=195.98s)]
*  again. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=200.42s)]
*  As for the press briefing room, we are certainly exploring ways on how to make sure that room [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=201.42s)]
*  reflects the media habits of the American people in 2024, not in the 1980s. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=206.9s)]
*  And if this election proved anything, it proved that the American people are no longer listening [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  to the mainstream bias, anti-Trump legacy media. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=217.62s)]
*  In fact, the ratings of many networks—not this one, but some others—are in the tank, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=221.62s)]
*  and Americans are consuming their news from podcasters, social influencers, and yes, TikTok, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=226.22s)]
*  as President Trump so exceptionally used on the campaign trail. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=231.38000000000002s)]
*  So we will look to effectively communicate his message through all mediums so that all [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  Americans are hearing the facts from the White House directly, not through the lens of the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=240.34s)]
*  ever-biased anti-Trump legacy media. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=245.46s)]
*  And I think that President Trump is going to bring back what I call, Caroline Levitt, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=248.66s)]
*  the democratization of information where everyone—the stay-at-home mom, the welder [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  on the job looking at his phone at that moment, the billionaire who has 25 people looking [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=256.3s)]
*  over social media for him—everyone receives a presidential communication instantly and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=260.22s)]
*  free of charge. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=264.86s)]
*  We miss that kind of transparency. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=265.86s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, a new mom and our youngest White House press secretary in American history, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=267.66s)]
*  thank you so much. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=272.62s)]
*  We can't wait to see you behind that podium next month. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=273.62s)]
*  Happy New Year to you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=276.3s)]
*  Thank you, Kellyanne. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  Happy New Year to you and your family. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=279.74s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2-Irixpfec&t=281.18s)]
