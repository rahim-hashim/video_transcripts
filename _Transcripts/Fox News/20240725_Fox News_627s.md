# Ted Cruz: They're going to 'muzzle' Kamala Harris to avoid gaffes
**Fox News:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I)
*  Here with reaction Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, I know that's a lot, but the media is never going to do what I just did here, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=2.2600000000000002s)]
*  and that is play her in her own words. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  And what they should be doing is playing it and getting answers to every one of those [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=10.66s)]
*  comments that she made. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=16.04s)]
*  Well, they're not going to do that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=18.76s)]
*  You're right. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=21.48s)]
*  Her record is extraordinarily radical. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=22.48s)]
*  Let me say at the outset, Kamala can't have my guns. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=24.28s)]
*  She can't have my gasoline engine and she sure as hell can't have my steaks and cheeseburgers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=27.22s)]
*  She is a radical California leftist. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=31.78s)]
*  And to be honest, she perfectly captures where today's Democrat Party is. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=35.1s)]
*  Every one of the disastrous policies of Joe Biden the last four years, Kamala Harris supports [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=40.12s)]
*  when it comes to open borders. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=45.42s)]
*  Listen, as Republicans, if we do not refer to her every moment of the day as border czar [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=47.06s)]
*  Kamala Harris, we're committing a political malpractice because she was the one put in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  charge of the border. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  She's the one in charge of it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=60.459999999999994s)]
*  As you know, she didn't even bother to come to the border. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  She went once to El Paso and they cleaned it up. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=63.699999999999996s)]
*  So she saw no illegal aliens, but she never went to the Rio Grande Valley. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=65.92s)]
*  She never went to Eagle Pass. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=69.16s)]
*  She never went to Del Rio. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=70.34s)]
*  And just like Joe Biden, just like the Democrats in Congress, just like Colin Allred, my Democrat [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=72.06s)]
*  opponent, they support open borders. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=77.5s)]
*  They look at 11 and a half million illegals invading this country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=80.26s)]
*  They see future Democrat voters. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=83.86s)]
*  And we need to make sure every voter in America knows her record. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=87.06s)]
*  And it's dangerous. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=90.94s)]
*  Look, I got to tell you, coming out of the Republican convention last week, on one level, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=91.94s)]
*  I was encouraged. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  It's the best convention I've ever seen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  It's the most unified we've ever been. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=99.44s)]
*  But on another level, I was very worried because I was worried that Republicans, we were overconfident, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=101.66000000000001s)]
*  that there was an air of celebration. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=107.30000000000001s)]
*  Listen, there's a time to celebrate after the election, but we got a lot of work to do. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=109.7s)]
*  We're 103 days out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=113.86s)]
*  And the media is getting ready to spend billions of dollars building Kamala up, telling the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  American people she is a combination of Mother Teresa and Oprah and Gandhi. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=121.94s)]
*  And that is dangerous. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=127.06s)]
*  And by the way, they're also going to do a Joe Biden basement strategy with her. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=129.14s)]
*  They're going to lock her in the basement. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=132.9s)]
*  They know she commits a lot of gas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=134.38s)]
*  So they're going to muzzle her. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  They'll roll her out for one debate with Trump. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=138.62s)]
*  We'll see how that goes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=141.02s)]
*  And other than that, they're just going to spend billions of dollars in TV ads and trust [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=142.02s)]
*  the corporate media to create a fake image of her. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=147.02s)]
*  It's dangerous, and it means all of us need to focus on her actual record. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=150.14s)]
*  She lied about Joe's cognitive decline. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=155.18s)]
*  She lied and said the economy inflation was transitory. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  She lied about the border, said the border was secure. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=160.94s)]
*  She lied about basically every issue. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=164.46s)]
*  She's extreme on abortion. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=166.46s)]
*  She's extreme on the environment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=167.94s)]
*  She supports the New Green Deal. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=170.18s)]
*  She doesn't want fracking. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=171.82s)]
*  She doesn't want drilling. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=172.94s)]
*  She wants to reduce meat consumption. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=175.58s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=177.74s)]
*  I'm a paleo, you know, keto-friendly diet person, and all of which is, you know, her track record. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=178.74s)]
*  But you know, she's going through this honeymoon phase, the sugar high the Democratic Party [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=186.38s)]
*  and the media mob the state-run media is feeling. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=191.26s)]
*  How long do you think that lasts? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=194.1s)]
*  Because I don't think it's going to last, Senator. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=195.58s)]
*  I don't think there's any way it lasts, because whether they like it or not, this information, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=197.34s)]
*  these tapes I'm playing, these comments you're making, they're going to get to the American [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=203.02s)]
*  people. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  Young people 18 to 24 are going to know she called them stupid. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, listen, you know, you look at the timing the Democrats did this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=215.74s)]
*  They did this right after the Republican convention. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=222.1s)]
*  The reason they did that is typically a candidate enjoys a bounce from a convention. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=226.1s)]
*  The historical average is about four points. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=231.02s)]
*  It was savvy of them to do this right after the convention to try to cut off the bounce. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=233.22s)]
*  Now, the Democrat convention is coming up in about a month. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=237.18s)]
*  Their plan is for the next month to be a month-long Democrat convention. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=240.62s)]
*  And I think the media intends for the next 103 days to do nothing but puff her. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=245.54s)]
*  And look, put yourself in the mind of a radical leftist, whether you're a donor, whether you're [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=251.14s)]
*  an activist, whether you're a corporate media reporter. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=255.34s)]
*  Two weeks ago, you were despondent. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=259.06s)]
*  Your candidate had dementia. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  You knew you were going to lose. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=263.66s)]
*  You're terrified about Trump being president. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=265.18s)]
*  They're all now like a drowning man who's been thrown a life vest. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=267.74s)]
*  They're ecstatic. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=271.74s)]
*  They're jubilant. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=273.06s)]
*  And listen, I served in the Senate with Kamala. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=274.7s)]
*  I know her well. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=276.54s)]
*  Joe Biden was hapless, and he was a puppet who was moved by left-wing forces controlling [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=278.18s)]
*  his administration. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=283.02s)]
*  Kamala's a true believer. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=284.86s)]
*  She believes this stuff. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=285.86s)]
*  And you want to see an illustration of that? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=288.14s)]
*  Look at today. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=289.94s)]
*  Today, Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed the joint session of Congress. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=290.94s)]
*  I was there for the speech. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=294.54s)]
*  I sat down and spent 40 minutes with Prime Minister Netanyahu one-on-one right after [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=296.42s)]
*  the speech. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=301.14s)]
*  Democrats in both the Senate and the House, dozens of Democrats boycotted the speech, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=303.38s)]
*  including Kamala Harris. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=307.98s)]
*  She's the vice president. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=309.98s)]
*  She's supposed to sit right behind him during the speech. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=310.98s)]
*  And she's the presumptive Democrat nominee. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=313.74s)]
*  And she said, I will not attend. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=315.62s)]
*  She believes in this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=318.58s)]
*  You want to look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel radical front in the Democrat Party. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=319.7s)]
*  Kamala Harris embodies it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=325.66s)]
*  And I've got to say, for every down-ticket Democrat, I've encouraged Colin Allred, my [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=327.74s)]
*  Democrat opponent in Texas, you ought to campaign with border czar Kamala Harris. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=332.18s)]
*  Come down to the Rio Grande Valley. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=336.5s)]
*  Defend 11.5 million people invading this country. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=338.3s)]
*  We've got to make it about their records, because their record has been disastrous for [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=341.82s)]
*  this country. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=345.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, in fairness to Prime Minister Netanyahu, I think it was one of the most compelling [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=346.97999999999996s)]
*  speech ever given in that chamber. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=355.14s)]
*  And it really defined. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=356.14s)]
*  He has the moral clarity to understand the moment and the imperative nature of our alliance [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=357.14s)]
*  with Israel. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=362.82s)]
*  And one of the things, perhaps maybe one of the biggest failures of Joe and Kamala is [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=364.41999999999996s)]
*  the fact that they have surrendered in the war against radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  And by that, they didn't support the offensive efforts. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  Israel lost the equivalent of 40,000 Americans in one day, and nearly 10,000 Americans would [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=379.14s)]
*  have been taken and held captive in one day. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=386.74s)]
*  And not supporting Israel's right to win that war and putting the pressure on Israel the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=391.26s)]
*  way that they have and not supporting their offensive efforts, to me, was a complete capitulation [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=396.24s)]
*  and surrender. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=403.0s)]
*  That might be the biggest moral failing of this administration, because if you're not [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=404.8s)]
*  going to fight, if you don't have the moral clarity to see the difference between, you [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  know, let me ask, put it another way. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=415.0s)]
*  What part of murder, Senator? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=416.92s)]
*  What part of rape? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  What part of kidnapping? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=420.34000000000003s)]
*  What part of beheading? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=422.04s)]
*  What part of torture? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=423.48s)]
*  Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, that idiot George Clooney, his wife understand. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=425.92s)]
*  What are they missing? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  Because I'm having a hard time understanding it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  Look, the tragedy is when they see these radical terrorists, when they see the protesters burning [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=434.92s)]
*  the American flag, hoisting the Palestinian flag over Union Station, Kamala Harris and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  the radicals of the Democrat Party, they're cheering for the protesters. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=446.72s)]
*  That's who they are. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  And you know, I agree with you. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=451.92s)]
*  This speech was remarkable. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=454.1s)]
*  As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu afterwards, it was Churchillian. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  And that is an adjective I have not used for any other world leader. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=459.98s)]
*  I think Benjamin Netanyahu appreciates the gravity of the situation, the existential [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=463.02000000000004s)]
*  threat to Israel and to America. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=468.18s)]
*  Listen, those who hate Israel hate America. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=470.86s)]
*  Those who hate Jews hate Christians. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=473.42s)]
*  And Kamala Harris wants the votes of the radicals on campus who are anti-Semites. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=475.46000000000004s)]
*  As you noted in your opening monologue, Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, they're [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=480.6s)]
*  talking about him. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=484.6s)]
*  But CNN reported just matter of fact, well, it's a problem in the Democrat Party that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=485.6s)]
*  he's Jewish. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=490.24s)]
*  They're now admitting that the Democrat Party has mainstreamed anti-Semitism because they [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=491.44s)]
*  want the votes of the radicals. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=496.64s)]
*  And I got to say again, my opponent in Texas, Colin Allred. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=499.38s)]
*  She supported them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=502.16s)]
*  Happily. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=503.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=504.16s)]
*  She supported those people at Columbia. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=505.16s)]
*  Sorry Senator. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=509.04s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=510.52s)]
*  She also bailed out the Black Lives Matter, Nantifa rioters who were burning shops, who [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=511.52s)]
*  were committing assaults. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=517.56s)]
*  When it comes to radicals, when it comes to people threatening violence, Kamala Harris [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=519.28s)]
*  and the radical left, they side with those radicals. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=523.68s)]
*  And it is, it's dangerous. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=527.4s)]
*  And listen, I'm not saying that while Netanyahu was speaking that Kamala Harris went to Union [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=530.16s)]
*  Station, pulled the American flag down, lit it on fire and then started dancing around [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=535.48s)]
*  a Palestinian flag. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=539.88s)]
*  She didn't quite do that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=541.72s)]
*  But I'll tell you this, her sympathies are more with the lunatics and radicals who did [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=542.84s)]
*  than they are with Prime Minister Netanyahu who is standing up trying to save Israel [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=548.32s)]
*  and America from radicals who when they chant death to Israel and death to America, they [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=552.7s)]
*  mean it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=558.12s)]
*  And the stakes on this election, they are existential. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  And as I noted, Colin Allred, my Democrat opponent, he welcomed a radical Islamic cleric [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=564.0400000000001s)]
*  from Texas as, quote, the he always represents the best of North Texas. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=569.4s)]
*  Well, that cleric today tweeted out an image of Benjamin Netanyahu as a war criminal. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  That's who the Democrat Party is. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=582.72s)]
*  And let me say to your viewers, Schumer is spending $100 million against me. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=584.64s)]
*  So please go to Ted Cruz.org. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=588.8s)]
*  I need your help because this is a three point race right now. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=590.56s)]
*  It is a battle between the radicals that have taken over the Democrat Party and common sense [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=595.0s)]
*  that stands up and defends America. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=600.72s)]
*  Senator, you have been a outspoken voice for the cause of liberty and freedom and a staunch, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=603.48s)]
*  solid conservative. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=610.1999999999999s)]
*  We need you back in the Senate. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=611.8s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz, thank you. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=613.0799999999999s)]
*  Anywhere else. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNEAWbpm5I&t=624.52s)]
