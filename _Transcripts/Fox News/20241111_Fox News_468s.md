# The media has a lot of ‘inward’ reflection to do: Eric Trump
**Fox News:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE)
*  Here now with more from the Trump Organization. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=0.0s)]
*  Eric Trump is with us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=2.2s)]
*  You know, let me deal with this issue. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=3.72s)]
*  By the way, can you confirm, has the secretary of state been chosen? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=5.88s)]
*  Is it Senator Marco Rubio? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=10.24s)]
*  Listen, Sean, I'll let my father confirm that one, but I'm a big fan of the senator. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=11.8s)]
*  He's an amazing guy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=18.48s)]
*  He was just with him a couple days ago. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=19.48s)]
*  He worked very hard on the campaign. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=20.84s)]
*  And we're a big fan, as a family, of the senators. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  But I'll let my father break that news. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=25.72s)]
*  OK, fair enough. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=28.36s)]
*  You are the head of the Trump Organization. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=29.96s)]
*  I thought I'd give it a shot. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  I'd give it my best shot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=32.88s)]
*  Let's talk about the death of legacy media. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  What you and your family have been through since the moment your dad came down that escalator [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  and all the lawfare and all the weaponization and all—everything—Russia, Russia, hoax, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=45.32s)]
*  hoax, 51 former intel officials, FISA warrants, you know, trials, charges, depositions, the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=50.8s)]
*  whole bit. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=59.32s)]
*  The media went hogwild over all of it, and the American people didn't buy any of it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  That's what I interpret out of this election. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=67.76s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, the media has lost all their credibility. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Listen, my father won the popular vote by, what, 5 million votes, the largest electoral [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=74.92s)]
*  college victory in, what, 50, 60 years in this country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=79.72s)]
*  And clearly, he had a media that was 98 percent against him every single day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=84.4s)]
*  And by the way, Sean, let me just remind you, this is the same media that we as a family [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  knew so well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  You see Joe and Mika on MSNBC every single morning, and they're trashing him every morning. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, they used to spend half the weekends at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=96.64s)]
*  They were there all the time with my father, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=99.64s)]
*  This is Oprah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=101.56s)]
*  Oprah, another person who used to love going to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=102.56s)]
*  Erin Brunette, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=105.56s)]
*  Same thing, was always around. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  We'd have lunch with her in Trump Tower all the time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=109.24s)]
*  The Anderson Coopers, the Don Lemons, I mean, we literally knew them all, and they loved [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=111.44s)]
*  us, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  They loved us. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=116.91999999999999s)]
*  He was begging to be on The Apprentice every—they loved us until my father decided to go down [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  that escalator. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  And then, like this, it all changed, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  It just all changed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=125.76s)]
*  It was a pylon all day, every single day. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  They knew his heart and soul. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=130.36s)]
*  They knew us as a family. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=131.52s)]
*  They were friends of ours. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=132.72s)]
*  And it all changed when he went down that escalator. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=134.28s)]
*  But clearly, they got the American people wrong, because no matter how bad their coverage [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=136.24s)]
*  was, my father had maybe the most decisive victory in the history of American politics. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=139.84s)]
*  And so I think the media has a lot of inward reflection to do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=145.88s)]
*  I'm not actually sure if they're capable of doing it, because they are elitist and, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=149.44s)]
*  you know, they pretend to be smarter than everybody else, and what they say goes, right? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=153.36s)]
*  And we've seen that for years and years and years. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=157.12s)]
*  But I do think that the media in this country has less credibility than it's ever had [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=160.36s)]
*  before. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=163.84s)]
*  You know, hence the reason that the podcasts are doing so well, hence the reason that Joe [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=164.84s)]
*  Rogan's doing so well, hence the reason when my father goes on with Elon Musk on Twitter [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=168.2s)]
*  He had 2.1 billion total impressions from that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=173.0s)]
*  I mean, the landscape of the media is changing drastically, because the American people do [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=177.0s)]
*  not trust them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=181.24s)]
*  They don't trust them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=183.68s)]
*  And by the way, they have earned that distrust. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=184.68s)]
*  And you know, I feel like I was in the forefront of this revolution and this shift between, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  you know, now being on radio for over 30 years and being here on Fox for 29 years, and legacy [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  media, they have no influence at this point. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  And they thought for sure that they had called this election. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=202.16s)]
*  Tom Homan is going to be on. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=204.72s)]
*  I went through all the numbers, all the statistics. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=206.0s)]
*  We know that there are known terrorists, there are cartels, we know about the drugs, the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=210.0s)]
*  murder, the rape, you know, the violent crime, all of it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=213.88s)]
*  And we're going to talk about something that your father has promised to do, and that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=218.52s)]
*  is to get rid of people that did not respect our laws, borders, sovereignty, especially [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=223.76s)]
*  criminal illegals that Harrison and Biden led into the country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, I think there's ways to do it and do it compassionately. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  Maybe give people a window, a period of time. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  They can self-report, and then they will be deported, we'll fly them back to their home [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=241.48s)]
*  country, maybe put some money in their pocket and let them rebuild their lives and allow [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=246.12s)]
*  those people in a year to apply to come into the country legally. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=250.76s)]
*  But if people don't self-report, then at that point, when they get caught, they're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  going to be flown out of the country, returned to their home country, and they will never [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  have a chance to become a legal citizen. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=264.76s)]
*  Does that sound like a decent idea? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=267.08s)]
*  No? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=269.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=270.24s)]
*  Sounds like a great idea. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=271.24s)]
*  I mean, listen, you've had 20 million people come across the southern border and you wonder [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=273.24s)]
*  why housing prices have gone through the roof. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=275.92s)]
*  I personally lost four friends to fentanyl, meaning four friends of mine have children [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=278.36s)]
*  that have died to fentanyl. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=282.28s)]
*  Geez. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=283.28s)]
*  You have police departments all over the country that are running out of Narcan, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=284.28s)]
*  That's how much fentanyl is coming all over the border, and they're not doing a damn [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=287.2s)]
*  thing about it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=289.4s)]
*  And I can't tell you how heartwarming it is when I see a guy like Holman, who's dead [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=290.4s)]
*  serious about solving this problem, making sure—I mean, you had a great little segment [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  just now on terrorists that are inevitably coming into the country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  There are people coming into this country over the southern border that want to do this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  country harm. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=303.44s)]
*  It's just a matter of time. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=304.56s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=305.56s)]
*  It's not if, it's when. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=306.56s)]
*  And that cannot happen in the United States of America. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=308.2s)]
*  Second of all, there's millions of people who want to come into America and they want [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  to do so legally, and they're willing to wait in line and they're willing to learn [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=313.2s)]
*  the language, willing to pay the taxes, they're willing to verify who they are. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=317.24s)]
*  And we know that they're not going to be bad actors, and yet they're denied every [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=322.36s)]
*  single day. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=325.68s)]
*  Yet you have 157 hotels in New York City that are full of illegal immigrants who literally [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=326.68s)]
*  broke the law, and us as taxpayers are paying for every single one of them to literally [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=331.44000000000005s)]
*  be housed in the nicest hotels in New York. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=335.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  We're not doing anything about the drug pandemic. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  We don't know who these people are. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  They are going to inflict harm on the United States, and they did so— [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, it's got to happen. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=345.64000000000004s)]
*  And I can't tell you how much safer it's going to—of course it is. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=347.12s)]
*  It's just a law of big numbers, Sean. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=350.28s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmuHo78JbsE&t=351.28s)]
