# This feels like 'deja vu': Eric Trump
**Fox News:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE)
*  All right, joining us now to react to the second now assassination attempt against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=0.0s)]
*  former president and presidential candidate Donald Trump, the executive vice president [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=3.96s)]
*  of the Trump Organization. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=8.64s)]
*  Eric Trump is with us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=9.96s)]
*  Eric, I want to be very clear, as I was with Steve, I cannot praise the agents around your [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=11.28s)]
*  dad enough for their heroism. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=18.0s)]
*  They dove on your dad. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=21.22s)]
*  They did everything right. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=22.72s)]
*  They got him out of there quickly. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=24.52s)]
*  The one agent that just happened to see the barrel of this gun, amazing work on that agent's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=26.52s)]
*  part in every way, probably, it sounds to me, your dad was in within seconds yet again [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=33.04s)]
*  of being assassinated. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=40.36s)]
*  That's how I read this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=42.2s)]
*  The question I have for you, and you happen to be a marksman that can hit a target from [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=44.64s)]
*  a mile away. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=50.64s)]
*  I know how skilled you are. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=51.839999999999996s)]
*  You shoot with the top shooters in the country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  My question for you is, how is it possible this treed area where your dad was playing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=56.54s)]
*  at this time, by the fourth, fifth, sixth hole over there, is well known for where paparazzi [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=63.8s)]
*  get pictures and videos of your dad playing golf. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=71.28s)]
*  It's the only—they hide in the bushes and they get the pictures. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=73.72s)]
*  And what I don't understand is why that area was not swept and why there weren't [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=77.04s)]
*  agents preventing anybody from getting into that area after it was swept. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  That to me is a massive security failure. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=86.68s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=89.64s)]
*  Well, Sean, my reaction is it feels like deja vu. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=94.64000000000001s)]
*  It feels like five weeks ago you and I were having the exact same conversations we're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  having today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, let me just be very clear. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  They are trying to kill the man. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=101.68s)]
*  They are trying to kill my father. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=102.68s)]
*  They are trying to kill the 45th president of the United States. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=104.0s)]
*  You've seen two attempts on his life in the last five weeks. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=106.76s)]
*  You know, and I have to—I agree with Steve 100 percent. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=108.84s)]
*  The Secret Service, men and women, I knew the people on stage in Butler and I knew many [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  of the people that were on the ground, you know, literally two days ago. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I know these people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  These are the greatest people you'll ever meet. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  These people will take a bullet from my father. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=121.28s)]
*  They'll take a bullet for any side. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=122.76s)]
*  That's their job. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=124.36000000000001s)]
*  They love their job. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  They're incredibly good at their job. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=126.36000000000001s)]
*  And if I could give that agent who saw the rifle barrel popping through a chain-link [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  fence in the middle of, you know, big Eureka bushes, if I could give them a big hug, I [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=131.4s)]
*  would do so right now because there's no question that that person saved lives these days. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=137.08s)]
*  At the same time, I agree with you 100 percent. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=141.96s)]
*  I mean, what's happening with the perimeter to these sites? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  How can that possibly happen? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=146.32s)]
*  I mean, you're showing a picture on TV right now of an AK-47 with a scope, you know, and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  a former president and very likely future president based on the poll numbers and everything [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=151.8s)]
*  else who was less than 300 yards away. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=155.96s)]
*  I mean, one bullet. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  This country, the history of this country changes forever. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=160.28s)]
*  One bullet. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=163.0s)]
*  You know, the way the U.S. is perceived changes in a flash. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=164.0s)]
*  How many other close calls do we have to have? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=170.26s)]
*  When can we finally get our act together? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  And so, you know, those agents on the ground, they are remarkable. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=174.5s)]
*  They are remarkable. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  And thank God they were there and the way they respond. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=179.12s)]
*  But there is a breakdown. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=182.2s)]
*  At some point, there has to be. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=183.2s)]
*  I mean, this is two assault rifles within 300 yards of the president. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  The first one being 130 yards of the president in a five-week period of time. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=188.2s)]
*  And there's only so many chances in the world that you get. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=192.28s)]
*  There are only so many lives that you're given. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=195.04s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, just God bless. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=197.44s)]
*  What happens if the agent would have missed that little skinny rifle barrel popping through [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=200.88s)]
*  a fence? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=204.2s)]
*  I mean, what happens if they just would have been looking the other way? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=205.2s)]
*  What happens if a bird would have flown overhead and distracted them in some way, shape or [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=208.2s)]
*  form? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, the future of this country could be very different. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  So, you know, Sean, I am so grateful in so many ways to them, some of my closest friends. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=215.72s)]
*  At the same time, on the perimeter, somebody is letting those incredibly brave agents down [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=222.16s)]
*  because this cannot happen. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=227.36s)]
*  And just remember one other thing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=228.36s)]
*  I mean, the reports just came out that it looks like that person, based on their cell [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=229.36s)]
*  phone records, started showing up in that location at 1 o'clock in the morning. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=233.18s)]
*  1 o'clock? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=236.96s)]
*  I mean, that person had been there for, what, close to 12 hours at that point? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=237.96s)]
*  It's incredibly disconcerting. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  It's concerning for the country. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  It's concerning for the hundreds of millions of Americans who would march to the end of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  the world for a man that they love, a man that they adore, a man that's leading the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=247.8s)]
*  race for 47th president of the United States. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's definitely deep concerning for, you know, for his family and for guys like me [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  who love him deeply. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=259.8s)]
*  You know, I agree with you and I agree with Steve. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=263.0s)]
*  The agents around your dad, there are no better people on the face of the earth. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=266.18s)]
*  I completely agree. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=270.36s)]
*  However, that area that is wooded, you know, and I listened to the head of the Secret Service [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=272.24s)]
*  very closely today, and he was praising not only those agents, but praising the whole [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=277.56s)]
*  operation as if it was a great success. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=283.0s)]
*  I don't view it as a success if somebody with an AK-47 and a scope is 300-plus yards [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=286.28s)]
*  away from your dad, because that is a layup or a one-foot putt if you're a shooter. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=292.2s)]
*  And so the question is, why wasn't that wooded area swept? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=299.56s)]
*  We need an answer. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=302.84s)]
*  And why weren't there agents on Congress Avenue that were monitoring to make sure that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  nobody went into the treed area where they would—and bringing a gun, no less, in there [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  with them? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=317.24s)]
*  That to me is where the failure went, where the failure happened. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=318.4s)]
*  And this is very similar to what we have learned out of Butler, is it not? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=323.24s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=330.52s)]
*  I don't think it's a success having an assault rifle 300 yards away from the president. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  I've shot since I could walk, Sean. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=336.88s)]
*  It's something I know very, very well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  It's probably something I know better than most. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=340.79999999999995s)]
*  I did it competitively. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  I did it in pretty much all the disciplines. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  A 300-yard shot is a layup shot with a modern-day scoped rifle. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=346.96s)]
*  It is a layup shot. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=350.2s)]
*  It's a shot that will be made every single time. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=351.2s)]
*  The shot in Butler, Pennsylvania, was a 130-yard shot. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=353.12s)]
*  It's a shot that my six-year-old son could make every single time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=356.76000000000005s)]
*  Sean, these are layup shots, and it's incredibly disconcerting that that is happening. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=359.44000000000005s)]
*  I agree with you 100 percent. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  You're right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=365.8s)]
*  The agents on the ground were incredible, and it was a success for them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=366.8s)]
*  And they should be hugged, and they should be complimented, because, again, they saved [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  lives. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=373.6s)]
*  That one agent who saw the barrel saved lives. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=374.6s)]
*  You better believe that they saved lives. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=376.48s)]
*  They should get every award, every accommodation, every raise. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  But there is a problem if they're leaving a perimeter 300 yards insecure around. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=381.12s)]
*  You know, what— [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=385.16s)]
*  In a way, can you argue that the fact that he saw a barrel of a gun through a fence [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=386.16s)]
*  in a treeed area was maybe a little bit lucky, and that we can't rely on luck, that we [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=394.24s)]
*  have to rely on sweeping any area within any perimeter that would allow somebody with a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=400.72s)]
*  scoped rifle that close to your father or to any elected politician, for that matter, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=407.68s)]
*  is not a political issue? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=412.4s)]
*  Sean, of course it was lucky. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=415.6s)]
*  You know how much vegetation we have on golf courses? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's kind of what we're known for, right, having some of those lush, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  beautiful golf courses, right, to have a little pencil barrel that's, you know, 750 thousandths [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=424.04s)]
*  of an inch effectively going through a plant. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=429.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty damn lucky in order to say—and again, thank God that they did. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=432.0s)]
*  So I agree with you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=436.12s)]
*  Do I think it's—as a son, do I think it's a glowing success? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=437.12s)]
*  The agents certainly there, certainly the agent that saw that barrel, absolutely glowing [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=440.72s)]
*  success. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=444.16s)]
*  The people that got my father off that golf course, absolutely glowing success. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=445.16s)]
*  The fact that a person in the middle of the day was able to camp out, you know, on a perimeter [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=447.88000000000005s)]
*  of a golf course, you know, looking inward on him, no, that wasn't a success at all. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  And as a son, I have to say, I'm sick and tired of having this conversation. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=456.56s)]
*  You and I had this conversation five weeks ago. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  This exact same conversation under the same circumstances. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  It's disconcerting. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=464.92s)]
*  You only have so many lives. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=465.92s)]
*  And Sean, I go back to the fact, that man right there, that man is a hero to so many [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=467.44000000000005s)]
*  Americans. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  This is a guy who saved this country. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=472.96s)]
*  This is a guy who spent the last decade fighting tooth and nail under the most unthinkable [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=474.32s)]
*  attacks to save the country against his own comfort, against his own, you know, family's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  interests, against his business issues. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  They tried to take him down. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=487.34s)]
*  They tried to throw him in jail. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=488.88s)]
*  They tried to bankrupt him. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=490.5s)]
*  They tried to separate his family. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=491.79999999999995s)]
*  They, you know, they tried to take him off the ballot and subvert democracy in this country. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  They've done everything they could. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  They tried to impeach him. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=500.2s)]
*  They took down his friends. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=501.24s)]
*  They did everything. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=502.52s)]
*  Yet that man right there is still fighting. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=503.52s)]
*  And I expect him to be protected. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=506.12s)]
*  I expect him to be safe. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=507.40000000000003s)]
*  This country expects to have democracy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  And then I get to hear Kamala Harris at a debate say that that man right there, who's [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=511.42s)]
*  the most brave person I've ever met, is a threat to democracy. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=515.32s)]
*  You know, Sean, the bullets are only going one way. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  It's really interesting how that works. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=520.8s)]
*  Why is it that that man right there is taking every bullet literally and figuratively? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=522.2s)]
*  He's taken every bullet from a weaponized system. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=527.16s)]
*  He's taken every bullet from a gun. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=529.42s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=532.5999999999999s)]
*  The media sweeps it under the rug. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=533.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, I heard an interesting statement the other day. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=534.5999999999999s)]
*  It was actually a meme the other day on social media that the Will Smith slap got more attention [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=536.5999999999999s)]
*  than Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=540.88s)]
*  And I think that's close to being true because the mainstream media swept it under the rug [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=541.88s)]
*  as quickly as they could and moved on to their next shiny ball to try and promote either [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=546.5s)]
*  Joe Biden at the time or Kamala Harris, which they do every single time. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=550.76s)]
*  I mean, why is this person literally the punching bag for absolutely everything? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=555.0s)]
*  And then you hear Kamala coming out and saying, yes, you know, Donald Trump is a threat to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=560.24s)]
*  democracy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=563.64s)]
*  The only threat to democracy is the people who are trying to kill that incredible man [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=564.64s)]
*  right there, again, somebody loved by the entire country. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=567.36s)]
*  And, you know, they've got to tone down that rhetoric to the whole, you know, Joe Biden. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=570.72s)]
*  We're going to put a bullseye on Donald Trump. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=575.0200000000001s)]
*  That has to end. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=577.44s)]
*  The Maxine Waters comments, they have to end. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=578.6s)]
*  The mainstream media who goes after him every single day, it has to end. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  They are creating a culture of hate in this country. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=586.32s)]
*  And you know what, Sean, if we ever lost one of our leaders, if we ever lost a presidential [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=590.2800000000001s)]
*  nominee, a former president, we'd look like a third world country. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=595.0400000000001s)]
*  It cannot happen in the United States of America. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=598.72s)]
*  They have to get the resources to keep our political leaders safe. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=601.0s)]
*  We have to do a better job. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=607.0s)]
*  We cannot have a third incident. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=608.2s)]
*  There will not be a third. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=609.6400000000001s)]
*  We cannot have this conversation again, Sean. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=611.44s)]
*  You and I have had too many of them. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=613.76s)]
*  Well, I agree. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=615.36s)]
*  And there are so many good people in law enforcement, including the sheriff's department and the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  Palm Beach police department. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=623.08s)]
*  They did an amazing job. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=624.5s)]
*  But that area needed to be swept. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=626.4399999999999s)]
*  And we've not gotten an answer. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=628.76s)]
*  Eric, we're glad your dad's okay. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=630.36s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=632.56s)]
*  And I don't want this conversation again either. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=633.56s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhU44OcWwE&t=643.76s)]
