# Hannity: Democrats are acting like the ‘sky is falling’
**Fox News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4)
*  And welcome to Hannity and breaking tonight, guess what? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump just secured the release of yet another American hostage. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=2.88s)]
*  This is the seventh U.S. citizen that is freed under Donald Trump, not including hostages [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=7.32s)]
*  that were released in Israel by Hamas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=12.76s)]
*  Now, only hours ago, a teacher named Mark Fogel, who was wrongfully imprisoned in Russia [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=15.56s)]
*  during Joe Biden's presidency, is now a free man. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=20.52s)]
*  He is set to appear at the White House in just a matter of minutes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=24.28s)]
*  When that happens, we'll bring it to you live. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=27.56s)]
*  And thanks to negotiations by Donald Trump and his special Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  the United States ended up giving up nothing in exchange for Mark Fogel's release, according [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=36.2s)]
*  to National Security Adviser Mike Walz. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  Quote, this was a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign that we are moving [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=49.18s)]
*  Now, I'm sure the Democrats, the media, they'll all be praising the president's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  strength to make this deal happen and thanking him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=57.6s)]
*  But seriously, don't expect any accolades from the Democratic Party or the state-run [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=61.64s)]
*  legacy media mob. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=66.28s)]
*  Democrats learned nothing after the election in November of 24 and now seemingly only care [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=68.28s)]
*  about three things. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=73.2s)]
*  They want biological men playing women's sports. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=74.28s)]
*  They want to protect criminal, illegal immigrants who do not respect our borders, our law, our [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=76.82s)]
*  technology, even though murderers, rapists, cartel members, gang members, none of that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=82.12s)]
*  matters, known terrorists in our country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=87.12s)]
*  And maybe most of all, they really want to keep spending tens and hundreds of billions [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=89.4s)]
*  of your hard-earned tax dollars on radical extreme left-wing causes around the world [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=94.92s)]
*  without any audit, no accountability. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=100.32s)]
*  And the hysteria over Doge and Elon Musk has been off the charts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=103.72s)]
*  Just to be clear, the left is absolutely outraged that Elon Musk and his team, working for free, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  are rooting out waste, fraud, abuse and corruption inside your federal government, your money [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=115.76s)]
*  being wasted, thrown down the drain, instead of being spent on schools and law and order [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  and, you know, a better country for the American people, lower taxes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=126.76s)]
*  This is what the American people voted for. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=131.78s)]
*  This is what they're getting. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=134.34s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  The public voted, you know, we have a majority of the public voting for President Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  We won the House. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  We won the Senate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  The people voted for major government reform. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  There should be no doubt about that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=152.72s)]
*  That was on the campaign. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=154.92s)]
*  The president spoke about that at every rally. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=156.88s)]
*  The people voted for major government reform, and that's what people are going to get. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  They're going to get what they voted for. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of times, you know, people that don't get what they voted for, but in this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=165.72s)]
*  presidency, they are going to get what they voted for. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=169.44s)]
*  And that's what democracy is all about. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=172.24s)]
*  Why do people hate Elon Musk? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=175.24s)]
*  He's about to save two astronauts that Joe Biden and Kamala abandoned for nearly 300 [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=177.44s)]
*  days in space. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=183.36s)]
*  He offered the people of North Carolina and Tennessee, you know, starling for free because [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=184.96s)]
*  they needed an ability to communicate with others. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=191.32s)]
*  He did the same thing for the people in California after the wildfires. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=194.32s)]
*  Doge has now uncovered tens of billions of dollars' worth of improper payments. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=198.0s)]
*  This includes over $100 million for DEI training grants at the Department of Education, $9 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=203.32s)]
*  million for Central American, quote, gender assignment services in Latin America from [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=208.76s)]
*  the Department of Agriculture. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=214.6s)]
*  Figure that one out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=216.84s)]
*  Another $145 million in DEI contracts with the Department of Labor, Transportation, other [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=218.12s)]
*  institutions. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=223.64s)]
*  And get this, among all the other crazy far left expenditures uncovered at USAID a few [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=224.76s)]
*  years ago, this organization also reportedly paid for notorious Al Qaeda terrorist member [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=231.56s)]
*  Anwar al-Awlaki. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  Remember that guy? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=240.0s)]
*  Apparently they paid for him to go to school at Colorado State University. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=240.84s)]
*  Full ride. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=244.72s)]
*  Compliments of view. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=245.6s)]
*  The American taxpayer. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=246.72s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  Just take a look at your screen today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=249.2s)]
*  Doge discovered that the paperwork for federal employees, look at this, who retire is processed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=250.88s)]
*  by hand 230 feet underground in an old limestone mine in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Now this, you know, cumbersome operation requires more than 200 employees. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=263.92s)]
*  By the way, there are something called computers. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=268.56s)]
*  They may want to use them. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=271.92s)]
*  Then we now have something called artificial intelligence. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=273.32s)]
*  And they're obviously working at a snail's pace. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=276.64s)]
*  The paperwork operates on a backlog, can take multiple months to process. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=279.72s)]
*  And meanwhile, four FEMA employees, they were just fired for continuing, in spite of the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=285.48s)]
*  president's order, to send taxpayer dollars to hotels in New York City for illegal immigrants. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=290.44000000000005s)]
*  Remember, FEMA was putting illegal immigrants in four star hotels in New York City. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=296.56s)]
*  That is literally hundreds, if not thousands of dollars a night. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=303.44000000000005s)]
*  People in North Carolina forced to sleep in tents in the middle of winter, months [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=307.72s)]
*  after Hurricane Helene. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=311.68s)]
*  And as you can see, this is all about accountability, efficiency. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=313.56s)]
*  But according to the Democrats, the sky is falling. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  One notorious radical left-wing pastor literally calling for violence. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=320.6s)]
*  I hope the Secret Service is paying attention against Elon Musk, telling his congregation, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  we are on the verge of bloodshed and sometimes violence is necessary. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=330.24s)]
*  Huh. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=335.12s)]
*  We'll run that for you later in the show. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=335.62s)]
*  Other Democrats lashed out at President Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=337.48s)]
*  For example, Maxine Dexter is now famous for wanting to quote, bleep Donald Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  We'll let you figure out the bleep. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=347.36s)]
*  I just, I've been told I have 30 seconds. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=350.36s)]
*  So I am going to tell you that we do have to, I don't swear in public very well, but [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  we have to f*** Trump. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  Please don't tell my children that I just did that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=365.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=370.6s)]
*  Apparently, this is the latest talking point too, from the Democratic Party. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=371.6s)]
*  Take note. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=376.6s)]
*  They all sound the same. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=377.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=378.6s)]
*  I'll tell you, I'm from Jersey, so I look a little differently. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=379.6s)]
*  I say f*** Trump. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=382.6s)]
*  We are going to beat. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=384.6s)]
*  I was going to say f***, but no, we're not. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=387.6s)]
*  No, I'm not going to say that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=390.6s)]
*  F***. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=392.6s)]
*  They're going to bleep Donald Trump. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  That's so uplifting, so inspiring, so full of vision for the country. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  That's really going to help make your life better. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  And wait, it gets more dumb. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  For some reason, Democratic Congresswoman Presley also announcing her support for censorship. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  Look, let me tell you something. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  I'll take a bit of umbrage here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=414.92s)]
*  I'll speak on behalf of my colleagues. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  I think I can say, we are all willing to work with anyone who's serious about doing the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=417.92s)]
*  work of censoring the American people and advancing progress. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=424.12s)]
*  But they are not serious. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  And of course, what kind of left-wing resistance movement would be complete without a little [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=432.8s)]
*  cringeworthy, predictable singing? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=437.88s)]
*  Join in, shall you, at home. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=441.12s)]
*  And last, but certainly not least here is idiotic senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=447.92s)]
*  whining to fake news CNN about the death of democracy, all because Donald Trump, Elon [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=477.88s)]
*  Musk and Doge are criticizing, you know, waste, fraud, abuse, corruption, and criticizing [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=483.84s)]
*  judicial overreach because what they can't do at the ballot box electorally, what they [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=490.8s)]
*  can't do legislatively, well, what do Democrats always do? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=495.68s)]
*  They run to far-left activist judges. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=498.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=500.92s)]
*  Senator Murphy, as we look at the developments that have happened in the last 48 hours, what [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=501.92s)]
*  are your concerns about this moment that we're at with the courts, with the president, and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=507.52s)]
*  with the suggestion from two of his top advisors that maybe they defy the court's rulings? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I mean, this isn't hyperbole to say that we are staring the death of democracy [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=518.24s)]
*  in the eyes right now. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=525.0s)]
*  The centerpiece of our democracy is that we observe court rulings. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=528.12s)]
*  No, it's the death of misappropriating the money of the people that work hard in this [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=533.52s)]
*  country that on average make only $66,000 a year. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=539.3199999999999s)]

*  your DEI-ism worldwide, and not taking care of the American people first. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  When this is all said and done, I want to extrapolate out how much money every American [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=555.92s)]
*  could have gotten off their taxes if they didn't give this money and spend this money [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=560.62s)]
*  on this radical agenda. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=565.58s)]
*  That's not the death of democracy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=567.32s)]
*  That is the return to constitutional order. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=569.36s)]
*  That is a return to the vision of our framers and founders, limited government, greater [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=571.94s)]
*  freedom. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=576.12s)]

*  Finally, they've talked for decades about ending waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=580.46s)]
*  Now we're going to do it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=584.62s)]
*  Now, this perpetual state of rage, while at times entertaining, it's getting a little [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=585.62s)]
*  hard to watch. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=590.42s)]
*  The sky has been falling for 10 years since Donald Trump and Melania came down that escalator [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=591.64s)]
*  at Trump Tower. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=596.3s)]
*  And yet Trump has his highest approval numbers ever. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=597.3s)]
*  Look at this, a joint poll. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=600.78s)]
*  Trafalgar, that's Robert Cahilly. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=602.38s)]
*  Insider Advantage, Matt Towery. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=604.62s)]
*  Trump, up nine points. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=606.82s)]
*  Again, the American people voted for government and reform and for good reason. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=608.62s)]
*  It's been a train wreck in the Washington swamp for decades. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=613.86s)]
*  Americans also wanting strong new leadership overseas. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=617.74s)]
*  Once again, promises made, promises kept. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=621.38s)]
*  And just listen to Jordan's King Abdullah earlier today at the White House. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=624.34s)]
*  He seems very open to what the president is proposing for the Middle East. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=628.1800000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, I truly believe that with all the challenges that we have in the Middle [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=632.26s)]
*  East that I finally see somebody that can take us across the finish line to bring stability, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=636.98s)]
*  peace and prosperity to all of us in the region. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=642.54s)]
*  And it is, I think, our collective responsibility in the Middle East to continue to work with [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=646.14s)]
*  you, to support you, to achieve those lofty goals. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=650.62s)]
*  The president's proposal, we'll go in, we'll clean out the rubble, we'll rebuild [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=654.78s)]
*  Gaza, and we'll create tons of jobs and wealth for the people in the area so they [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=658.98s)]
*  can have better lives and we'll demilitarize the place. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=666.38s)]
*  Oh, what a radical idea. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=669.54s)]
*  We'll have peace in the Middle East. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=671.26s)]
*  The King appeared open to the president's plan. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=673.06s)]
*  America exceptionalism is making a comeback. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=675.74s)]
*  As a result, the entire world, it will be a better place. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=677.98s)]
*  And by the way, make sure to check out the Gulf of America. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=680.98s)]
*  If you look on Google Maps, there it is, the Gulf of America. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=684.5s)]
*  They're getting it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOnjCSBLRA4&t=687.98s)]
