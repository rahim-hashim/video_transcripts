# Harvard students reveal what they really feel about the university president
**Fox News:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c)
*  ... our very own Sarah Carter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=0.0s)]
*  She traveled to Harvard, where she caught up with a research associate who's not happy [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=1.52s)]
*  with the conduct of their president, but does not want her face of any kind or any of these [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=6.74s)]
*  kids to be disciplined. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=12.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  Even Harvard presidents are not perfect, OK? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  And she was overly primed by her lawyers, and she—you know, she didn't say the right [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=18.5s)]
*  thing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=23.04s)]
*  OK, so—but it doesn't mean she should be punished with resignation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=24.04s)]
*  She's going to learn, you know? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=27.88s)]
*  I think she was sideswiped by that question. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=29.48s)]
*  All right, here with more from her trip to Cambridge, our very own Sarah Carter. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=32.68s)]
*  Sarah, to me, there's no moral ambiguity here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  This is moral clarity. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=41.64s)]
*  Either Harvard stands against murder and rape and torture and terrorism and kidnapping, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=43.32s)]
*  or they don't. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=53.56s)]
*  This was not a deep question that she was being asked here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=55.86s)]
*  And the thing is, if you apply the standard of Elise Stefanik's question to any other, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=59.9s)]
*  quote, identity group, you tell me, would there be consequences to any student at Harvard? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=66.18s)]
*  Well, absolutely, Sean. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  She's also not a child. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=76.18s)]
*  She knew she was testifying before Congress, and she had to prepare to testify before Congress. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=78.48s)]
*  So this wasn't a trick question. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=84.78s)]
*  You know, many of the students that I interviewed here in Cambridge also made excuses for President [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=86.86s)]
*  Gay. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=93.58s)]
*  They said, you know, she was caught off guard. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=94.58s)]
*  She didn't really know what she was saying. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=96.8s)]
*  And what I found really surprising, Sean, was the fact that it was difficult for many [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=98.86s)]
*  of the students to actually answer the very simple question, are calls for genocide against [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=103.56s)]
*  the Jewish people against and violating the code of conduct here at Harvard University? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=111.38s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=118.46s)]
*  Do you feel, though, that her inability to respond to whether or not genocide, the calls [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=119.46s)]
*  for genocide violated the ethical code of standard here at Harvard? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=125.74s)]
*  Exposed that maybe she was wavering on a subject that should have been very simple to answer? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=133.66s)]
*  I do not know enough about that to comment, to be able to comment fully to be honest. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=140.54s)]
*  Personally, I think that it's important for university leadership to be held accountable, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=148.14s)]
*  but I also think that she's tried really hard to fix mistakes she made. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=151.89999999999998s)]
*  And I do believe that she did make mistakes as an administrator, but I think it'd be [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=156.06s)]
*  wrong to just get rid of her just because she made these mistakes, and it's important [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=161.94s)]
*  to show that she's ready to learn and grow from the mistakes that she made. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=167.3s)]
*  I can't, like, I'm not—I feel indifferent. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=171.10000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the corporation, Harvard, supports genocide, so, I mean, whoever is the face [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=173.94s)]
*  of the institution doesn't really matter. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=179.22s)]
*  So you felt like her testimony wasn't so much offensive, it's just that— [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=181.86s)]
*  Oh, it was bad. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=186.18s)]
*  It was bad. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=187.18s)]
*  The testimony was awful. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=188.18s)]
*  Sean, there are a number of major Harvard donors who are not going to let President [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  Gay slide. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=196.78s)]
*  In fact, one of them is billionaire Bill Ackman, who stated that he will no longer be donating [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=197.78s)]
*  to Harvard as long as they keep President Gay in her position of power after her anti-Semitic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=203.1s)]
*  testimony. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=208.9s)]
*  And he assessed that $1 billion in donations have already been pulled from Harvard from [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=210.06s)]
*  alma mater and other donors, Jewish as well as other non-Jewish donors, that would have [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=217.34s)]
*  been donating to the campus. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  Sean? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=223.94s)]
*  All right, great report, Sarah Carter at Harvard tonight. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=224.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNBruALy1c&t=227.89999999999998s)]
