# Sean Hannity: The White House is guilty of aiding and abetting illegal immigrants
**Fox News:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA)
*  First, we turn to a political stunt at the White House, three and a half years into his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=0.0s)]
*  four-year term, only 153 days until Election Day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=5.22s)]
*  And all of a sudden, your president, Joe, shuffled out to the podium to announce an [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=10.66s)]
*  executive order on the border crisis. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=15.1s)]
*  Now, this deadly crisis has been raging for more than three-plus years, but with just [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=18.3s)]
*  a few months until the election, Biden has now decided it's time for action. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=23.1s)]
*  Of course, Biden's election conversion, well, that will do next to nothing to actually solve [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=29.12s)]
*  the crisis. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=34.379999999999995s)]
*  It's all smoke, it's all mirrors. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=35.379999999999995s)]
*  And as reported by our own Bill Molluskian, it does not stop the 1,500 illegal immigrants [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=37.7s)]
*  per day released into the U.S. or the 30,000 illegal immigrants per month that Biden is [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=43.08s)]
*  flying directly into the U.S. that you're paying for. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=49.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, unaccompanied minors, they're exempt from the order and don't expect any kind of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=52.72s)]
*  mass deportation of the 10 million-plus unvetted Joe Biden illegal immigrants already in our [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  country and, as we have mentioned many times, from our, many are from our top geopolitical [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=63.4s)]
*  foes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=68.58s)]
*  In other words, nothing's going to change except Biden's talking points. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=69.58s)]
*  So let's step back. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=73.68s)]
*  How did we get here? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  At the end of Trump's first term, the border was secure like never before. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=77.68s)]
*  Illegal immigration plummeted. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=82.72s)]
*  Trump's border security measures, they were working. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=84.97999999999999s)]
*  In January of 2021, on Biden's very first day in office, with the stroke of a pen, as [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=88.24s)]
*  we've been saying over and over, Joe terminated Trump's border emergency designation, redirected [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=94.33999999999999s)]
*  funds away from the border wall, he suspended deportations, ended Trump's remain in Mexico [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=100.83999999999999s)]
*  policy, Title 42, and that's not all. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=107.24s)]
*  In the first few months of the Biden administration, so many border protections were rescinded [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=111.2s)]
*  that the DHS Secretary Mayorkas, he couldn't even be bothered to list them all. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=117.4s)]
*  The list was so long. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=122.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  So we have rescinded so many Trump immigration policies, it would take so much time to list [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=133.44s)]
*  We rescinded the remain in Mexico policy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=134.44s)]
*  We rescinded, of course, the public charge rule that deprived vulnerable migrants from [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=138.48s)]
*  accessing certain critical life benefits. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  We have restored the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the DACA program. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  We have rescinded so many and have restored so many that he really dismantled. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=156.22s)]
*  Now, to the surprise of no one, millions of illegal immigrants from all around the world [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=165.58s)]
*  began pouring across the border. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  Now, the scenes were and the scenes remain horrific. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=172.38000000000002s)]
*  Border patrol is totally and is totally today overwhelmed, vetting still almost nonexistent, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  especially for certain special interest countries that we know are plagued with terrorism and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=182.18s)]
*  violence and are known to harbor terrorists. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=187.8s)]
*  But the Biden administration lied directly to your face and every American's face for [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=191.02s)]
*  almost three straight years. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=196.36s)]
*  And he told you that the border was secure and the border was closed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=198.58s)]
*  And they said it and they said it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=205.28s)]
*  Biden said it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=206.28s)]
*  Vice President Harris said it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=207.28s)]
*  Mayorca said it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  Circleback Jen Psaki said it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  Karine Jean-Pierre said it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=211.62s)]
*  They all said it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=213.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=214.36s)]
*  Sounds to most folks like a crisis. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=215.36s)]
*  Well, look, it's way down now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=217.46s)]
*  We've now gotten control. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=220.46s)]
*  Precisely that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=221.46s)]
*  The border is closed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=222.46s)]
*  Nor could I have been clearer and continue to be so, which is the border is closed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=223.86s)]
*  The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=230.46s)]
*  The border, we are working to make the border more secure. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=236.14000000000001s)]
*  You're confident this border's secure? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=240.58s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=244.24s)]
*  our administration. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=252.24s)]
*  We agree that the border is secure. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=253.24s)]
*  They all knew they were lying, but they did it anyway. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=257.0s)]
*  Despite the massive influx that we saw with our own eyes of illegal immigrants, the administration [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=261.36s)]
*  did nothing to stop or even slow the breakdown on our border. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=267.56s)]
*  Now the biggest national security threat, a clear and present danger to every American. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=272.86s)]
*  The White House told you not to believe your own eyes and then spend billions transporting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=278.8s)]
*  illegal immigrants across the country so the visuals at the border would be better. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=285.38s)]
*  They were and they are guilty today of aiding and abetting illegal immigrants and assisting [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=291.3s)]
*  in the trafficking of illegal immigrants. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=298.1s)]
*  Now, that's when major American cities, you all started to feel the pain, didn't you? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=301.02s)]
*  Even democratic cities, even sanctuary cities, even sanctuary states, resources were drained, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=306.36s)]
*  shelters full, schools and public parks were commandeered to help house the newly arriving [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=312.94s)]
*  Joe Biden unvetted illegals. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=320.14s)]
*  The financial burden was and is extreme. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=322.68s)]
*  Now, for example, let's look at New York City, sanctuary city that it is. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=326.46s)]
*  One in every five hotels is now used to shelter illegal immigrants. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  Month after month, taxpayers pick up that hotel tab. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=335.88s)]
*  Thank God I left. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=339.18s)]
*  And as a thank you to the good people of New York, well, some of these illegals turned [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=340.9s)]
*  to crime. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=345.62s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=346.62s)]
*  Just this week, an unvetted Joe Biden illegal immigrant, this one from Venezuela, who arrived [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=348.46s)]
*  in this country in 2023 and who was enjoying a taxpayer funded hotel room in New York City, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  shot two New York City police officers. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  Why police suspected him of committing a series of robberies. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=364.72s)]
*  Naturally, despite the Biden administration's best efforts to cover up the crisis, Americans [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=369.68s)]
*  on both sides of the aisle have become outraged and for good reason. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=375.52s)]
*  So after a few bad poll numbers, oh, and 153 days towards the election, Biden what? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=380.70000000000005s)]
*  Now finally changing his tune. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=388.82000000000005s)]
*  They call that an election year conversion. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  It actually has a name. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  He admitted the border was a disaster, but then he tried to blame Republicans. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=395.1s)]
*  Remember, he said he could, you know, he did all he could do to secure the border. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  Told us this many times, said it lasts in January. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=404.02000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=407.38s)]
*  He had the power the whole time. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=410.66s)]
*  Biden caused the crisis with a stroke of a pen. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=433.22s)]
*  But as we had said, he could at any time fix this crisis with the stroke of a pen. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=436.32s)]
*  Today's actions prove he always had that power to make the change. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=443.08s)]
*  Only his changes today, well, when you dig down deeper, they're completely meaningless. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=446.84s)]
*  And on the other hand, the insane Senate immigration bill that would only streamline asylum abuse [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=452.2s)]
*  by adding processing capabilities. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=458.56s)]
*  It wasn't a border security bill. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=461.56s)]
*  If anything, this legislation might have caused an increase in illegal immigration. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=464.0s)]
*  So the bill flopped. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=469.26s)]
*  And after a few more weeks of gaslighting you, the American people, and blaming Republicans [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=471.04s)]
*  for the crisis he created, Biden went back to the old drawing board. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=476.42s)]
*  And today, after swearing that he lacked the ability to address the border, after three [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=480.88s)]
*  years of lying, saying the border's closed and the border's secure, saying it over and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=485.64s)]
*  over again, he signed a single executive order claiming to do just that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=490.08s)]
*  But as the ever so eloquent Senator John Kennedy, Louisiana, pointed out today, this is just [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=495.14s)]
*  the latest dishonest political maneuver designed to fool the American people. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  Okay, I want you to listen up. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=506.21999999999997s)]
*  Here's the, here's the drill. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=508.2s)]
*  President Biden is in trouble politically. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=512.04s)]
*  He's polling right up there with fungal infections. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=519.0400000000001s)]
*  Part of the reason for that is that he gave in to the lone wing of his party, and he dissolved [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  the southern border. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=532.44s)]
*  Now, five months before an election, he has to appear to be willing to do something about [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=534.76s)]
*  it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=544.48s)]
*  Yeah, and don't trust a guy whose Uncle Bozie was eaten by cannibals, who really wasn't. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=546.0s)]
*  Bottom line, for three and a half years and counting, Biden chose not to secure the border. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=555.64s)]
*  The crisis is not an accident. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=560.48s)]
*  This was and is intentional. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=562.4200000000001s)]
*  And it won't stop until Biden is gone from office. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=565.12s)]
*  Hopefully in 153 days, he loses. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wURe4o7ATqA&t=568.6s)]
