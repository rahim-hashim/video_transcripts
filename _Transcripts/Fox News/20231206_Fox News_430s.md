# Hannity: The stakes could not be any higher
**Fox News:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight we are in beautiful Davenport, Iowa with a massive crowd. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome all of you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=15.4s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=16.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  And in a little more than one month, the very first Republican caucus will be held right [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  here in this state as it should be. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=26.52s)]
*  By the way, in just a moment, the candidate leading the Republican field by far, Donald [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=29.38s)]
*  J. Trump, will join us for the full hour tonight. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=34.339999999999996s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=37.06s)]
*  In 2024, the stakes could not be any higher. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=39.94s)]
*  After three years under Joe Biden, our country is imploding on every level. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=43.66s)]
*  Our economy is wrecked by inflation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  Our southern border is an utter disaster. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=50.3s)]
*  The American people are not safe. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=53.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=55.18s)]
*  What I would say that is unique about the environment that we're in right now in my [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=56.72s)]
*  career is that while there may have been times over the years where individual threats could [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=60.22s)]
*  have been higher here or there than where they might be right now, I've never seen a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=64.8s)]
*  time where all the threats or so many of the threats are all elevated all at exactly the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=69.12s)]
*  same time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=76.0s)]
*  That's what makes this environment that we're in now so fraught. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=77.0s)]
*  Are you concerned that international terrorism threats to the homeland are rising as the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  border continues to be broken? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  I am concerned that we are in an elevated threat environment, a heightened threat environment [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  from foreign terrorist organizations for a whole host of reasons. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=95.18s)]
*  And obviously, their ability to exploit any port of entry, including our southwest border, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=101.2s)]
*  is a source of concern. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  Concern? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=108.48s)]
*  Now, that was the FBI Director, Christopher Wray, today on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=110.2s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=113.92s)]
*  Our wide-open Joe Biden border is now a massive national security nightmare. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=115.64s)]
*  It is a clear and present danger, and it is only getting worse every day under President [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=121.84s)]
*  Biden. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=126.48s)]
*  In the past two years, well, over what? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=127.48s)]
*  Six thousand illegal immigrants from Afghanistan have crossed our southern border, along with [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=130.28s)]
*  3,000 Egyptians, more than 600 Iranians, you know, Iran, the number one state sponsor [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=135.64s)]
*  of terror, more than 500 Syrians, 12,000 Russians, and a whopping 26,000 people from China. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  This is a dire national security crisis, but that is only one part of the problem. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  For years, America's bloated bureaucracy, it has now become politicized. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  That includes the FBI, the DOJ, which have wasted precious time and resources with political, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=162.08s)]
*  motivated witch hunts. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  What? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=171.28s)]
*  They're looking into traditional Catholics or angry parents that go to school board meetings [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=172.28s)]
*  or pro-life advocates that are nonviolent, you know, Trump supporters, Donald Trump himself. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=177.12s)]
*  Instead of investigating real threats like terrorism, human trafficking, drug trafficking, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=184.44s)]
*  The FBI, their hyper-partisan Washington field office has obsessively, compulsively been [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=190.52s)]
*  targeting one person, one man, one family, and that's Donald Trump, the Trump Organization, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=196.6s)]
*  and the Trump family. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=202.04s)]
*  So now the 45th president is vowing to fight back and obliterate the deep state. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=203.36s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=208.56s)]
*  If you put me back in the White House, their reign is over. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=209.56s)]
*  Their reign will be over. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=213.88s)]
*  And they know it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=214.88s)]
*  And America will be a free nation once again. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=216.52s)]
*  We're not a free nation right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=219.08s)]
*  We don't have free press. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  We don't have free anything. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=222.02s)]
*  In 2016, I declared, I am your voice. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=224.36s)]
*  Today I add, I am your warrior. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  I am your justice. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=231.56s)]
*  And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=233.46s)]
*  I am your retribution. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to let this happen. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  Now that's become a controversy among the left. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=240.64s)]
*  Wrong, as he said earlier, but we'll play that for him and get a response tonight. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=247.64s)]
*  Now that's an important promise. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=254.72s)]
*  America's weaponized, politicized bureaucracy, it's got to be dismantled. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=256.56s)]
*  The far-left hacks and the media mob, of course, they disagree. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=261.96s)]
*  And once again, they are predicting doom and gloom if Donald Trump is elected. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=265.36s)]
*  Here's the Washington Post yesterday, quote, the fear of a looming Trump dictatorship. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=270.4s)]
*  And this is today's headline from Salon.com. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  Americans are sleepwalking into a Trump dictatorship. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=278.23999999999995s)]
*  It's now their favorite word. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  Over at fake news, all cable news channels, you know, they're featuring, you know, the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=283.34s)]
*  same brand of fear-mongering. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  Obviously it's clear they don't want to talk about Joe Biden and his failed record. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  Dictatorship. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  Is that what we would have if we reelect Donald Trump? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=296.68s)]
*  I think it's a very, very real threat and concern. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  I think the phrase sleepwalking into a dictatorship should wake people up. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=308.24s)]
*  It's not going to be the kind of dictatorship with concentration camps and martial law [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=309.48s)]
*  overnight, is it? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=313.32000000000005s)]
*  That's not what we're going to get. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=314.76s)]
*  We're going to get Trump borrowing from the Orban playbook in Hungary, from the Modi playbook [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=316.04s)]
*  in India. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=321.06s)]
*  And what does that look like, Jason? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=322.06s)]
*  What would that look like here in America? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  Years of a dictatorship. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=325.88s)]
*  The alarming prediction for a second Trump term. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=327.08s)]
*  Liz Cheney is right, what she said, that we are sleepwalking into a Donald Trump dictatorship [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=330.12s)]
*  if people don't wake up and remember what Donald Trump was to the four years, what he [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=335.76s)]
*  tried to do to our democracy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=341.6s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=345.48s)]
*  We already know what would happen under a Trump presidency. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=346.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=349.32s)]
*  Because he's already been president. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=350.32s)]
*  Lower taxes, stronger growth, a secure border, peace in the Middle East, new trade deals, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=351.8s)]
*  energy independence, and a push to reform our bloated bureaucracy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=359.12s)]
*  There was no dictatorship. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=365.2s)]
*  We did not lose our constitutional rights. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  We did not go to war. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=369.36s)]
*  The people who hate Donald Trump, they simply have been and continue to lie to you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, it's Joe Biden who has been using the justice system, his DOJ, to inflict retribution [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=376.48s)]
*  against his political rivals. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=382.52s)]
*  And it's Joe Biden who called Donald Trump's supporters a, quote, threat to America. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=385.0s)]
*  The very guy that says, MAGA Republican, oh, making America great is somehow bad. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=390.8s)]
*  And it's Joe Biden who is leading this country into the brink of yet another possible war. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=395.88s)]
*  And that's why Donald Trump is now beating Joe Biden in almost every major poll. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=401.52s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=405.64s)]
*  The latest Messenger Harris survey has Trump against Joe Biden up by six points. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=407.76s)]
*  So now the big question, can Donald Trump seal the deal and get the country back on track? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xyq7_4Mr8&t=413.15999999999997s)]
