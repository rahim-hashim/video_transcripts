# Sen. Kennedy: Fire these people on the spot
**Fox News:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg)
*  All right, Joe Biden's weakness on the world stage is now emboldening our adversaries. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=0.0s)]
*  Earlier today, a U.S. Navy vessel shot down another drone that was launched by the Houthi [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=6.68s)]
*  rebels in Yemen over the Red Sea. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=11.32s)]
*  But despite the growing number of attacks from the rebel groups, all senior Biden officials [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=14.16s)]
*  told Politico that the administration is wary of retaliating. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=23.0s)]
*  Anyway, meanwhile, a new report says the White House interns, the interns, are now rebelling [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=24.48s)]
*  against the administration in a letter demanding a ceasefire in Israel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=30.28s)]
*  Now, I would say there is a simple solution for these interns. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=35.08s)]
*  Fire them all. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=39.68s)]
*  It's that easy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=40.68s)]
*  Here with this very unique reaction, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=41.68s)]
*  You know, Senator, great to have you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  I've had a lot of interns work on this show over the year. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=52.72s)]
*  I can't think of a bad one that I've ever had. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=54.92s)]
*  But if a group of interns ever pulled anything like that on me, I would say, bye-bye. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=57.6s)]
*  Who's running that White House? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=65.84s)]
*  Because they have been taught this, we now know that many of our young people believe [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=69.8s)]
*  in diversity, equity, inclusion, and the right to kill Jews. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=78.24s)]
*  And they don't see the inconsistency in that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  They don't see the irony in that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=90.08s)]
*  And I think the reaction of most fair-minded Americans to that position, certainly my reaction, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  is pass me the sick bucket. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=100.36s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=104.8s)]
*  If I were President Biden, I would call all of my interns in and tell them, I'm sorry [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=106.34s)]
*  they're upset, they should go buy an emotional support pony, but they're fine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=114.17999999999999s)]
*  I don't think President Biden will do this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=122.42s)]
*  I can't imagine. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=124.66s)]
*  I can't imagine working for an employer. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=127.06s)]
*  It's OK to disagree with your boss, but I can't imagine working for an employer, writing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=131.22s)]
*  him a formal letter, leaking it to NBC, and then daring the employer to do something about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=138.22s)]
*  it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=148.34s)]
*  And probably the White House will do nothing about it, just like they have done very little [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=149.34s)]
*  to deter our enemies throughout the world. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  Let me ask you about China, for example. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=158.7s)]
*  We see them confronting our fighter jets in international airspace. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=161.54s)]
*  They confront our Navy in international waters. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=166.3s)]
*  The spy balloon, unfair trade practices, we don't have free and fair trade, intellectual [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=169.78s)]
*  property theft, spy balloons, all this combined. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=177.22s)]
*  And Joe Biden has done nothing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=181.02s)]
*  What does that say about Joe Biden? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=183.76s)]
*  Do you think in any way it might be connected to all the money that the Biden family made [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  out of China? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=189.26s)]
*  Well, what it tells me is that the Biden administration would rather debate whether men can breastfeed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=192.26s)]
*  than protect the interests of this country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=202.38s)]
*  Look, reality has a way of bruising people that don't respect it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=205.1s)]
*  And the sad reality is that our enemies, China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, are not scared [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=210.46s)]
*  of President Biden. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  And for good reason. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=219.78s)]
*  It was President Biden who abandoned Afghanistan. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=220.78s)]
*  It was President Biden who removed the sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=224.82s)]
*  It was President Biden who killed the FBI's China initiative. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=229.9s)]
*  It was President Biden who has refused to give Ukraine the weapons that it needs to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=234.66s)]
*  win. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  It was President Biden who removed the sanctions on Venezuela. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=241.3s)]
*  It was President Biden who refuses to respond to the recent attacks on American troops by [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  Iran, in Syria, in Iraq, and the Red Sea. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=252.66s)]
*  I think if President Biden had been president when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, he would [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=258.26s)]
*  have appointed a task force to see what we did to offend them. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  Senator, let me ask you this. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=270.46s)]
*  Can you name a single thing, a single policy that Joe Biden has implemented that has benefited [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=273.7s)]
*  the American people? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=279.08s)]
*  Because I cannot. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=280.08s)]
*  I can't. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=281.08s)]
*  I'm trying. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=286.08s)]
*  I want to be fair to the president. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=287.98s)]
*  I don't hate anyone, but I just I can't. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=290.66s)]
*  And our enemies, Sean, see what a majority of the American people see. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=295.42s)]
*  This may not be fair, fair or unfair, accurate or inaccurate. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=304.38s)]
*  Our enemies and a majority of Americans think the president is older than time, his family [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=308.44s)]
*  has corruption problems and the vice president, his vice president is weak and people act [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=314.26s)]
*  accordingly. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=320.42s)]
*  We cannot have you on enough. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=321.82s)]
*  Let's give a big hand, Senator. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9fp5R6MwTg&t=323.58s)]
