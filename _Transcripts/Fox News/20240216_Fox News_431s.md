# This is really damaging in the Fanis Willis case: Jonathan Turley
**Fox News:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY)
*  Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't really know where to begin, Jonathan, except to say that that judge was extraordinarily [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=3.4s)]
*  patient, I thought. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=7.68s)]
*  I found her to be defiant, combative. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=9.28s)]
*  Frankly, that quote that she made as a candidate, that, you know, people want a D.A. that's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=12.88s)]
*  not going to have sex, you know, and spend money, etc., I'm like, wow, isn't that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=19.36s)]
*  what this has evolved into? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=27.16s)]
*  Yeah, I actually thought the judge did a great job until the very end. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=29.84s)]
*  I thought that he did lose control of his courtroom to Willis, that she was able to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=34.72s)]
*  go on and on on these tangents. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=39.68s)]
*  And I think most judges would have shut her down much sooner. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=44.08s)]
*  He was very deferential and civil, and I think that's his style. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  He's a very good judge. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=51.28s)]
*  In the end, I was surprised how much she was allowed to go off on these tangents. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=53.48s)]
*  But what was really damaging here is the fact that both of these attorneys now stand credibly [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=59.44s)]
*  accused of filing false information with courts. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  That's what they're prosecuting defendants in this case for. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=70.28s)]
*  And in the case of Mr. Wade, when they went through the interrogatories that he answered [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=74.84s)]
*  in the divorce case, most of us view those answers now as demonstrably false. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=80.24s)]
*  So the question is, if she didn't have this personal relationship with Wade, would she [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  really be keeping him around under this cloud? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=90.91999999999999s)]
*  Most lead prosecutors would say, look, you need to step aside. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  But she's not. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  And both of them are now putting their own interests ahead of the case and ahead of their [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=99.32s)]
*  office, and that only compounds the ethical concerns in the case. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, the accusation is so severe, I don't see any other choice but that she [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=109.52s)]
*  would have to be removed from the case. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=116.44s)]
*  And considering that we now know he did not have the best qualificationsâ€”he never tried [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=118.92s)]
*  a felony case, Jonathan, and this is one of the biggest cases ever for the state of Georgia [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=123.58s)]
*  and for the country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=129.56s)]
*  To me, if they want to pursue something, they've got to go back in court, never mind the fact [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=131.64s)]
*  that I always thought the RICO statute that they used was ridiculous. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=136.28s)]
*  What's your take? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=140.52s)]
*  Well, I've never been a fan of this case, and I think the RICO theory is overextended. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=141.52s)]
*  They had to really stretch it to the breaking point to try to ensnare Donald Trump. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=150.54000000000002s)]
*  The attorneys that pled guilty earlier notably did not plead guilty to the racketeering theory. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=155.66000000000003s)]
*  They pled guilty to rather insular, relatively minor crimes that avoided jail time and allowed [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=161.44s)]
*  them to keep their bar licenses. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=168.12s)]
*  So they may not be as good a set of witnesses for Willis as she thinks. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=170.44s)]
*  And Sean, at the end of the day, it's unlikely that the court is going to dismiss this case. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=176.84s)]
*  The question is really not just whether the court will disqualify one or both, but what [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=182.48s)]
*  and Willis still doing in this case? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  They are clearly hurting their case. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=191.6s)]
*  So this isn't really their case at all, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=194.38s)]
*  This is supposedly the case of Fulton County, and yet they seem to be holding it hostage [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  to their own personal drama, which is playing out in this courtroom. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  But let me generally maybe disagree with you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=209.48s)]
*  If they are tainted and they're the ones that put this case together, and he didn't have [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=211.92s)]
*  the qualifications, he'd never tried a felony case before, Jonathan, and she's benefiting [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  financially with these lavish vacations that they're taking, how do you possibly stay [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=222.12s)]
*  with charges like this, knowing that the people involved in this were benefiting financially [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=229.44s)]
*  and that this was not motivated by their own personal gain? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=236.6s)]
*  That to me impacts the entire case. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=240.28s)]
*  She is the Fulton County DA. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  The buck should stop with her, and she is beyond tainted here. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=245.44s)]
*  I think it's a lot worse. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=250.28s)]
*  I'm using kind language, in my view, but I don't know how this case can stand. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=251.72s)]
*  I'm really having a hard time following you here. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=257.0s)]
*  Well, you know, look, I am not a fan of this case and never have been, but I'm telling [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=259.8s)]
*  you that if you look at how these types of issues have been handled in the past, they [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=265.52s)]
*  have tended not to dispense with the entire case. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=270.96s)]
*  They have tended to remove prosecutors, and I think the odds still favor that here, but [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=275.88s)]
*  they could end up delaying this case if both of them are disqualified. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=282.28s)]
*  This is putting the judge in a very tough position as to how he's going to proceed, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=288.08s)]
*  but what I saw today on that stand was embarrassing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=293.88s)]
*  I mean, both of these attorneys adopted bizarre, semantic approaches to things that were clear. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=297.96s)]
*  You know, she said, well, yeah, I gave him a job, but I don't view him as an employee [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=305.44s)]
*  under ethics rules. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=310.4s)]
*  I view him as an agent. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  And then she said, yeah, I probably did get $100 or more from him, but he probably gave [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=313.12s)]
*  me an equal or greater amount. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=318.84s)]
*  Those are the types of finessed interpretations. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  They would never accept as prosecutors. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  Keep in mind that prosecuting Trump over what the meaning of the word find is, they're saying [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=327.88s)]
*  that when he said you can find 11,000 votes, he was saying create them or invent them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  And Trump is saying, I was just telling them to do a statewide recount because that's all [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  the votes I need to change the outcome. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  So in prosecuting him, they have very little room in terms of interpretation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=346.68s)]
*  But when it came to their own defenses, they were as creative as a Hollywood producer. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=351.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=357.04s)]
*  Well, and by the way, there was a lot of context. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=358.04s)]
*  If you listen to that entire conversation or read the entire transcript of that call, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=361.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's case was, I won by hundreds of thousands. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=366.0s)]
*  I didn't win by just the 11,000 plus that would have put him over the top in Georgia. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=369.32s)]
*  He was saying, there's votes here, there's votes here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  This is what you missed here and there. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=378.88s)]
*  Did he believe it? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=381.44s)]
*  I think he passed a lie detector test. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=382.44s)]
*  That's my belief. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  Jonathan Turley. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=386.48s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=387.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=388.48s)]
*  Well, and also I direct your attention to how Wade explained his answers in those interrogatories. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=389.48s)]
*  The questions asked him if he had a sexual relationship going into 2022 at any point [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=396.88s)]
*  of his marriage or separation. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=402.94s)]
*  And he just said, oh, I answered that and just assumed it only meant my marriage. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=405.08s)]
*  And the lawyer was dumbfounded and said, I just read you the question. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=408.68s)]
*  So that's the level of denial we saw today. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=413.0s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=416.08s)]
*  All right, Jonathan Turley, thank you. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9Rv6nhfjY&t=417.08s)]
