# Kudlow: There is no law, order or safety
**Fox News:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU)
*  Here with reaction, the host of Kudlow on the Fox Business Network—Business Channel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=0.0s)]
*  Larry Kudlow, along with former senior Clinton adviser and pollster Mark Penn and Fox News [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  contributor Kellyanne Conway. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Kellyanne, we start with you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  Between the issue, if you look at the border—and I know the giggling trio of conspiracy theorists [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=14.1s)]
*  at MSNBC, they laughed at the exit polls that showed the state of Virginia that the number [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=19.2s)]
*  on the minds of people in Virginia was immigration, where a 14-year-old girl was raped by an illegal [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=25.58s)]
*  immigrant. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=32.42s)]
*  This on the heels of what happened to Lake and Riley—by the way, not Lincoln, Lake [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=33.9s)]
*  and Riley. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=38.22s)]
*  And, you know, I raise this because are they really that out of touch with the American [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=39.22s)]
*  people on this issue? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=44.8s)]
*  Are they out of touch with how they feel? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=45.8s)]
*  Yes, they are. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=47.86s)]
*  And no one more so than Joe Biden and his so-called border czar, Kamala Harris. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=50.94s)]
*  The polls show this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=55.3s)]
*  The disaffection with Joe Biden is coming from inside the House. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  He is underperforming Donald Trump in all six swing states, and particularly as goes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=59.58s)]
*  each man vis-à-vis their party. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=65.3s)]
*  So Joe Biden averages somewhere in the 70s, low to mid-70s, in terms of Democratic support [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=67.38s)]
*  in each of the swing—six swing states—Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=73.26s)]
*  Donald Trump is anywhere from 81 percent to 91 percent. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=79.9s)]
*  Why is that important? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=82.42s)]
*  Because if you have attrition in your core constituencies—African Americans, Hispanics, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=83.42s)]
*  women, people in the suburbs, young people, political independents—you open up, you [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=88.22s)]
*  expose yourself to third-party challenges. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=93.94s)]
*  RFK Jr., Jill Stein and Cornel West are all eating into Joe Biden. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  None of them are really taking anything significant from Donald Trump in terms of vote tally. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=101.1s)]
*  You mentioned Nevada. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=105.7s)]
*  This is important. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=106.7s)]
*  A Republican has not carried the state of Nevada presidentially since 2004, 20 years [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  ago. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=112.98s)]
*  Donald Trump is beating Joe Biden in the polls in Nevada. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=113.98s)]
*  Nevada has the highest unemployment rate, one of the highest housing costs compared [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=115.98s)]
*  to wages in the country, and is the only state that went from a blue governor, a Democratic [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=122.06s)]
*  governor, to a Republican governor in 2022. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  That's the kind of state that Donald Trump can flip, and it's all because of what you're [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=130.62s)]
*  showing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=134.3s)]
*  People know what they see, not what the Democrats say. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=135.3s)]
*  They see the border is out of control. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=137.29999999999998s)]
*  60 percent disapprove of Joe Biden's handling of Israel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=138.73999999999998s)]
*  Over 60 percent disapprove of his handling of the economy and inflation, and separately [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  of the border and immigration. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=146.14s)]
*  It's not a big mystery. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=148.17999999999998s)]
*  No, Mark, you've been doing polling like Kellyanne for a long time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=150.14s)]
*  We really saw this on display in the strongest way during the State of the Union, or jacked [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=154.38s)]
*  up Joe, and that was he was going so hardcore after his base. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  There was no reaching across the aisle. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=166.62s)]
*  This was a speech I'd expect at a convention at the DNC. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  And Biden is down 22 points with Hispanic Americans right now from where he was in 2020. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  He is down 30 points with African Americans. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=181.26s)]
*  Double digits, he's down with suburban women and young people. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  That is the base of the Democratic coalition. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't know—what is he—what can he say or do to go? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  How do you get those people back? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=196.5s)]
*  Maybe half of them will return home, but the people that are feeling the economy, that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=198.78s)]
*  don't like what they're seeing on their screen right now with immigration, the people [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=202.78s)]
*  that don't like what's going on worldwide in America abdicating its role on the world [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=206.94s)]
*  stage, the price of everything, law and order is deteriorating in big cities and small towns, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=212.46s)]
*  they're looking at their lives, and they're not saying they're better off than they [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=219.94s)]
*  were four years ago. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=223.5s)]
*  How does he get those people back? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=224.5s)]
*  Or can he? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=226.5s)]
*  Well, I think you're quite right that Joe Biden has to look more at the center of the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=228.5s)]
*  country and the suburbs and those swing voters and not worry so much about the base. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=235.1s)]
*  Don't worry, those base voters will come back in the end when they're faced with a [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  stark choice between Democrats and Republicans and Trump and Biden. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  But he's got to do more. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=249.34s)]
*  He's got to solve the immigration problem because that has skyrocketed to number one. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=250.74s)]
*  He's got to do something about the inflation and the high housing crisis that are really [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=255.82s)]
*  affecting people's everyday lives. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=261.18s)]
*  Mark, I'm going to give you all your time. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=262.18s)]
*  Hang on a second. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=263.18s)]
*  For three years, he said the border is safe and closed and secure. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=264.18s)]
*  He lied. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=268.14s)]
*  Now he's trying to blame Republicans. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=269.14s)]
*  You're saying that in the final 228 days he can all of a sudden pull out of his hat [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=270.14s)]
*  an answer to the border crisis he himself created? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=277.22s)]
*  I don't believe that's possible. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=280.66s)]
*  Well, look, I think the polls and I agree with Kellyanne on this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=283.02s)]
*  His lowest ratings right now are on immigration, which didn't matter much during most of that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=288.5s)]
*  three years. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=293.82s)]
*  But now that it's shot up to be the top issue of the country, he's got to do a better job [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=294.94s)]
*  addressing it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=300.46s)]
*  He's got to really both show compassion to people like DACA recipients, but most importantly, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=301.7s)]
*  do something about what most voters think is an open border. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=307.78s)]
*  I don't think he has any choice. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=311.42s)]
*  It's the absolute key to what he's got to do to try to get back here to even—he's [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=312.78s)]
*  just losing by Donald Trump by a few points, and immigration is that number one issue. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=317.86s)]
*  He's got to address inflation, got to address crime, education. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=323.82s)]
*  Sure, he's got core issues like abortion and climate change, but we know those. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=327.62s)]
*  Rally the base at the end. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=332.34s)]
*  Go for swing voters now. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=334.18s)]
*  I'm listening to you, but I'm sure you're right that some of those people will come [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  home, but I'm sure many won't either. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  And I would argue, Larry Kudlow, that the reason they will not be so inclined to get [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=345.78s)]
*  home because they don't like what they're seeing on the border, they don't like what [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=350.58s)]
*  they see in their grocery store, they don't like that their dollar is not going anywhere [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  near as far as it was four years ago. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=360.86s)]
*  They don't like defund, dismantle and no bail laws. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=364.26s)]
*  They don't like high gas prices. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=367.38s)]
*  They don't like any of it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=368.9s)]
*  Why should they? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=370.86s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you for having me. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=371.86s)]
*  And I want to go back to those pictures, incredible pictures. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=375.34s)]
*  That is an invasion of the state of Texas, and it is an invasion of the United States [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=379.82s)]
*  by a mob, a mob of illegals. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=386.94s)]
*  And that picture, which runs throughout the country, is a message that there is no safety, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=390.86s)]
*  no security and no law and order. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=398.18s)]
*  I mean, Trump calls it Biden's immigration crime. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=401.65999999999997s)]
*  And that crime is not just down there in El Paso or Texas. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=406.42s)]
*  That crime has become nationwide. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=410.38s)]
*  You know, the story in New York, four and a half billion dollars of stolen goods from [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=412.78s)]
*  the stores. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=418.02s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=419.18s)]
*  It probably is even greater than that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=420.18s)]
*  So that picture is important. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=422.14s)]
*  Mark Penn is a very smart guy and he's an old friend of mine. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=424.18s)]
*  But the fact remains, Biden will not close the border. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=427.38s)]
*  When he was inaugurated the next couple of days, he undid by executive orders all of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=431.78s)]
*  the Trump guards against the kind of picture we're seeing in El Paso. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=438.14s)]
*  He took out the remain in Mexico. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=443.58s)]
*  He took out the wall. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=446.9s)]
*  He increased the parole. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=448.88s)]
*  He increased the asylum. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=451.2s)]
*  And again, it's not just the fact that all these illegal mobs are coming in, which is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=453.4s)]
*  bad enough. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  It just sends a picture that there is no law, no order, no safety, no security. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=459.88s)]
*  And remember, Trump is building this phenomenal middle class working folks coalition of whites, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=466.4s)]
*  of Latino Hispanics, of blacks. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  Take a look at the numbers. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  They're phenomenal. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  These are people who are losing money. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=480.35999999999996s)]
*  Their real wages are going down. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=483.09999999999997s)]
*  Prices are still high. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=485.52s)]
*  20% increase in the CPI, 20% increase in groceries, 30% increase in energy. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=487.2s)]
*  Their mortgage rates and mortgage costs if they want to buy a home, over 7% on the rate. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=494.4s)]
*  It probably cost you another $1,200, $1,500 than it did a year, three years ago. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  Card purchases, you got to pay about 10% on that rate. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=506.6s)]
*  Credit card purchases, you got to pay about 25% on that rate. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=510.76000000000005s)]
*  So you have these economic pressures, you have these fears of law and order, and you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=515.16s)]
*  have pictures of literally an invasion of the United States by a lawless mob. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=520.4s)]
*  It is absolutely astounding. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=526.24s)]
*  And I do not think Biden will lift one finger to change that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=528.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't see any evidence that he wants to change that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=532.24s)]
*  That ship has sailed. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  And like you, I've known Mark a long time. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  Mark, you're going to smile because you know what I'm about to say is true. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=540.64s)]
*  You would have told him to pivot two and a half years ago. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=544.84s)]
*  True or false? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=548.28s)]
*  Last answer. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=549.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=550.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=551.28s)]
*  Absolutely true. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=552.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=553.28s)]
*  I've been saying this for a while. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=554.28s)]
*  Pivot to the middle. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=555.28s)]
*  That's it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=556.28s)]
*  That's where this election is going to be decided. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=557.28s)]
*  He didn't listen and he can't catch up. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  That ship has sailed. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=562.6s)]
*  That's my prediction. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=564.08s)]
*  Let's see who's right. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=565.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=566.08s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaDCBy3alaU&t=567.08s)]
