# ‘The View’ knows the ‘ship is sinking’: Elisabeth Hasselbeck
**Fox News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw)
*  So she's overnight gonna become an icon of MAGA and the American right she's probably gonna make a lot of money off of it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=0.0s)]
*  So I get why she did it. I [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  say [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=8.96s)]
*  Wouldn't do it even though I think no, I would not I would not normalize him and she says I love our country [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=14.24s)]
*  How do you love your country and support and normalize somebody who was a convicted felon who really wants to destroy the country in my opinion? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=20.54s)]
*  I don't understand how you say you love your country at the same time as you normalize this convicted felon [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=27.78s)]
*  If I believe I have the right to make up my mind to go perform someplace [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=33.300000000000004s)]
*  I believe they have the same right of course and and so I have to yeah [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  I got a sir. I have to support doesn't mean I'm particularly interested in what I won't be watching [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=41.14s)]
*  They can't help themselves here with reaction author of the children's book God's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=48.22s)]
*  Masterpiece broadcaster Elizabeth Hasselback as well as don't you miss? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=53.82s)]
*  Sitting at that table. You've got a deep down. You must really miss that noise. You've got to miss it. I [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=58.62s)]
*  Mean deep down I I'm missing out. I'm just thankful to be here with you. This is safe territory Sean [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=66.32s)]
*  Although I would have loved to have been at that table today [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=72.7s)]
*  They have refused to put anyone there who has a lick of sense on most days [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=74.9s)]
*  But today when those comments got passed around even whoopi Goldberg could not agree with the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=77.88s)]
*  Outlandish remark of Joy Behar [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=85.72s)]
*  I mean Joy Behar wants us to in the name of by the way liberal tolerance at its best, right? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=87.56s)]
*  This is what we're seeing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=92.92s)]
*  She wants us to believe that Carrie Underwood who won American Idol by American votes who had an album and tour [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=93.84s)]
*  Called all-american girl who actually has spent more time on USO tours [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=100.64s)]
*  Serving and helping and donating money to our nation's finest our military their families and our veterans is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=105.84s)]
*  About to perform America the beautiful at the historic event of the inauguration of the president of the United States of America [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=112.08s)]
*  And that she's un-american. I don't care. I mean, it's it's so ridiculous [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=119.52s)]
*  So ridiculous [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=125.32s)]
*  They're living [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=126.92s)]
*  it's as though the election never stopped for them and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=128.52s)]
*  They just cling to their their hatred of Donald Trump, which is fine [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=132.28s)]
*  I have no problem with that at all [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=136.22s)]
*  but like a lot of these late night comedy shows that no longer have anybody watching them and they're officially on [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=138.36s)]
*  Cancellation notice because they're not going to survive with the numbers that they're getting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=145.36s)]
*  I don't think the view will survive ultimately either [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  So they start out by alienating half the country, but that's only part of it. They also [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=151.10000000000002s)]
*  They they continually lie to their audience [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=157.68s)]
*  And I would argue that any content provider [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  Moving forward that is going to have any level of success [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=165.48s)]
*  They're not going to get away with the what? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=169.32s)]
*  MSDNC and fake news CNN and ABC NBC CBS do and that is lie to their audiences and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=172.56s)]
*  Are so partisan and political and pretend to be journalists. That's not going to survive any longer [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  Sean you just put a dart right in the center. Okay. This is all I have to say [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=185.84s)]
*  I can't agree with you more [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=191.12s)]
*  You're 100% right when we see and we know listen you and I know joy and I've actually known Carrie as long as I've known [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=192.4s)]
*  Joy and friends with one and been colleagues with another you can take the guess your audience, but I'll say this [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=199.2s)]
*  What joy is up to is nothing more than selfish personal publicity gain right now [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=205.2s)]
*  She wants to attach her name to Carrie Underwood's name so that she maintains relevance because they're not going to be able to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=209.28s)]
*  Relevance because they know the ship is sinking number one number two though even considering that we cannot let a dysmorphic lie [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  Sit out there in the air. It has to be extinguished and that's what we're doing tonight [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=222.88s)]
*  We're actually being truth bearers because what we know to be true is that it's actually more un-american to call someone un-american [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=226.17999999999998s)]
*  For exercising their American rights is every person that shows up on Inauguration Day from security to custodial staff [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Un-american is that what joy's saying if you show up there to do your job? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, she is a woman who says she's for women and strong working women. That's a lie [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=243.76s)]
*  She should be supporting Carrie Underwood and actually Carrie's a great great woman [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=248.72s)]
*  she could learn a lot from her because Carrie surrounds herself with people who don't always agree with her politically or [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  Postured themselves precisely how she does be it faith or anything else [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=258.08s)]
*  But she's not I have no idea and actually joy if she were as strong as she was she could learn I [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=262.28s)]
*  Have no idea what Carrie Underwood's politics are and I don't care [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know what Rascal Flats politics are. I just like their music. I don't know about the village people [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=271.52s)]
*  I don't know about their politics, but I'm glad they're gonna be there. It's gonna be a fun night [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=277.28s)]
*  Probably not a lot of fun for Kamala supporters. Are you going to the inauguration or no? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  No, I'm thinking about it we've got to work out some [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=290.4s)]
*  Calendar issues here. I'd certainly love to be there. I think it's a historic event [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  I think if you have the opportunity as an American to be a part of something or near something this great you should [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=298.04s)]
*  I'm even gonna get dressed up just one night only I'll get really dressed up [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=303.56s)]
*  All right, thank you [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerTqGtO8Pw&t=310.6s)]
