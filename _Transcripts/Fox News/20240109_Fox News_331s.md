# Border security means national security: Tom Homan
**Fox News:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E)
*  Now, Biden continues to ignore the crisis that he himself created at our southern border, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=0.0s)]
*  as 2024 GOP candidates have vowed to close it, as, of course, the disaster is now impacting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=6.08s)]
*  cities and small towns in every corner of this country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=11.6s)]
*  A fatal stabbing at a migrant shelter in New York City is now shedding more light on the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  dangerous conditions inside the camps. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=20.16s)]
*  And yesterday, a group of illegal immigrants tried to steal over $5,000 worth of sunglasses [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=22.72s)]
*  from a New York City Bloomingdales. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=28.72s)]
*  The problem has gotten so bad that city leaders there are now pleading for help from the administration. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=31.52s)]
*  Denver's Democratic mayor is now calling for federal support for the, quote, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=37.28s)]
*  unsustainable crisis in his city. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=41.04s)]
*  The city officials in the small city of Whitewater, Wisconsin, they're asking for help. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=43.92s)]
*  As they say, the influx of illegal immigrants is putting a strain on resources there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=48.96s)]
*  We're here with reaction former Acting ICE Director Tom Homan and Fox News contributor [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  Sara Carter. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=59.76s)]
*  By the way, Tom, Sara, you're part of a new group called what, border911.com, if I'm not [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=61.44s)]
*  mistaken, Tom? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=67.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's a nonprofit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=70.4s)]
*  Sara's a part of it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=72.56s)]
*  I started a nonprofit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=73.52s)]
*  It's a 501C3C4, border911.com. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=75.12s)]
*  It's a bunch of us, immigration border experts, who are going to spend the next year educating [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=78.64s)]
*  American people on why border security matters. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=83.84s)]
*  So when they get to the voting booth, they vote for border security, because border security [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=86.64s)]
*  means national security. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=90.56s)]
*  Sara, you've been down there so many times. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=94.64s)]
*  And you have chronicled how badly that these illegal immigrants are being treated by the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  cartels. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=101.92s)]
*  We know about the opioid and fentanyl crisis in the country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=102.72s)]
*  But what scares me the most is the sheer number of people that they have allowed in unvetted, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=106.0s)]
*  coming from countries like Iran and Syria and Egypt and Afghanistan and China and Russia. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=110.96s)]
*  Why would people from those parts of the world be making their way to our southern border? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Are they all coming here because they just want better lives for themselves and their [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  families? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  Or you think maybe there could be terror cells walking across our border? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Oh, absolutely guaranteed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  Guaranteed there are terror cells that have made their way into our country with this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=133.68s)]
*  wide open border policy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  And Sean, you were just discussing, even with Michelle Obama and Barack Obama, this is their [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=139.2s)]
*  policy too. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  This open borders, non-sovereign policy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  So Americans have to understand that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=148.72s)]
*  It's just that President Biden is so terrible at it, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=150.64s)]
*  He is so terrible at delivering the message, and Americans are seeing it across the board. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  This border has been wide open. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=158.88s)]
*  We know now 32% only approve of Biden's immigration policy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=160.32s)]
*  I'd like to know who that 32% is. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=165.2s)]
*  But right now what we're seeing is a wide open border. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=167.92s)]
*  December numbers were through the roof with over 300,000 people coming in. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=170.64s)]
*  And let me make this clear. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=175.92s)]
*  Over 85%, this is what we're hearing right now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=177.83999999999997s)]
*  Bill Mollusian reported on it earlier. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  I've been talking to sources that are saying the same thing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  Over 85% are being immediately released into the country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  So what we're seeing in Chicago, what we're seeing in New York, what we're seeing in Denver, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=190.56s)]
*  in Dayton, Ohio. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=194.72s)]
*  And to top it off. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Border 911 is really focused on this as well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=197.84s)]
*  Is the over 112,000 fentanyl deaths. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  So Sean, you're right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  This is a national security alarm that is going off so loud that the American people [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=205.52s)]
*  have one chance and one chance only in 2024 to turn our nation into a right direction [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  and end this open border policy before it destroys our country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think it's happening. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=222.88s)]
*  I mean, you know, in many ways, the fact that we had secure borders under President Trump, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=224.32s)]
*  Tom Homan, and now they're not secure and they abandoned all the policies that were working. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=229.84s)]
*  You know, I would say they're going to have blood on their hands. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  They already have blood on their hands in terms of allowing these drugs into every crevice, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=238.64s)]
*  every corner of our country. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=243.28s)]
*  And don't seem to care. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  They don't seem to care about the human trafficking on top of it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=246.48s)]
*  They don't seem to care at all about vetting people from countries, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=249.44s)]
*  our top geopolitical foes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=253.84s)]
*  That scares the living daylights out of me. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=255.36s)]
*  You get the last word. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=257.12s)]
*  Look, I've done this since 1984, Sean. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  I spent 34 years doing this job. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=261.92s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=264.24s)]
*  If President Trump was still the president and I was the ice director, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=264.96s)]
*  these people wouldn't be in New York City. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  They'd be sitting in an ice detection facility waiting to be deported. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=269.68s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=272.64s)]
*  This administration has no humanity. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=274.08s)]
*  A record number of migrants have died in U.S. soil crossing borders, over 1,700. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=276.24s)]
*  A record amount of Americans have died from fentanyl overdoses. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=280.48s)]
*  Sex trafficking on women and children are up 600%. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=283.68s)]
*  The rest of the people on the terrorist watch list is over 300 just on the southwest border. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=287.76s)]
*  Four years under Trump, 11. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=293.76s)]
*  Three years under Biden, over 300. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=296.0s)]
*  This is a national security failure of huge proportions. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  And I'm scared to death of what's coming. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=301.6s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=305.2s)]
*  And it's because this administration purposely, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=305.92s)]
*  purposely unsecured our border, the most secure border of my lifetime. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=308.64s)]
*  They tore it down intentionally. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=313.04s)]
*  Clear and present danger. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=315.44s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate you both. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOfgMvzyl9E&t=317.44s)]
