# Trump spokeswoman: Biden laughed with 'limousine liberals' while Trump paid his respects
**Fox News:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI)
*  Joining us now with reaction Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce, Project 21 Chairman Horace Cooper, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=0.0s)]
*  and Trump 2024 National Press Secretary Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Thank you all for joining us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=10.84s)]
*  Tammy, I want to go to you because the optics, the contrast, the execution of what happened [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=12.36s)]
*  here, I mean, you got a dead New York City police officer and nothing from President [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=19.64s)]
*  Biden. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=24.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's awful. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=25.68s)]
*  And yet, it perhaps is one of the most honest evenings we've seen in a very long time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=28.2s)]
*  We've always seen honesty with President Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=33.4s)]
*  One thing about that guy is that you know who he is. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=35.84s)]
*  He is always going to be himself. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=38.96s)]
*  He never adjusts the nature of what he's going to say or do to trick people or to pander. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=41.4s)]
*  And you saw the nature of how he cares about not just police officers and the firefighters, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=47.04s)]
*  but the nature of blue collar work, regular, everyday anonymous heroes in this country, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  average citizens putting their lives on the line to keep their own community safe. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=59.12s)]
*  That is the ultimate of the American ideal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=64.24s)]
*  And so that is Trump. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=67.6s)]
*  And that's what infuses that kind of empathy, infuses what he says and does. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=69.14s)]
*  No matter whether you've liked his style or not. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=74.62s)]
*  That's why he had success. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=77.96s)]
*  Biden, on the other hand, is also, was completely himself. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=79.8s)]
*  The Democrats, you know, we used to call them, Jason, you'll recall, limousine liberals. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=83.72s)]
*  This is nothing new. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  They've just been caught at the lie that they care about the average individual. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=89.6s)]
*  This was just, it was obscene. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=94.72s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=96.96s)]
*  It was certainly a lack of empathy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=98.64s)]
*  And it's almost as though empathy has been excised from them in some kind of a surgery. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=102.4s)]
*  And they're all there laughing it up, having a great time with their big celebrity pals, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=108.26s)]
*  making lots of money. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=114.9s)]
*  The ultimate disconnection with the nature of what's happening in this country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=116.44s)]
*  Two very distinct visions of what's going on. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=120.18s)]
*  One, and they used to say all roads lead to Rome. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=123.06s)]
*  That used to be true, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=125.84s)]
*  Different policies, but all to the same place. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  The Democrat road now goes off that freaking cliff. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=129.26s)]
*  And it is the Republican road, no matter what your politics, that at least lead us to some [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=132.3s)]
*  semblance of a future that we can rely on. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=136.94s)]
*  Horace, you don't want to ever see politics injected, particularly at the pinnacle of grief [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=140.74s)]
*  and a grieving family, not just the family of Officer Diller, you know, a beautiful one-year-old boy, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  grieving wife. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=154.02s)]
*  You've got just an amazingly difficult situation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=155.62s)]
*  But at the same time, I saw zero reports about Joe Biden, the president, trying to call the family. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=160.18s)]
*  He could have certainly made time to go visit if you have Air Force, you have Marine One, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  you have all the assets of the federal government at your disposal to get to wherever you want to get to. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  And certainly even during a fundraiser, he could have taken two minutes and talked from his heart about it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=177.42s)]
*  But none of that happened, Horace, none of it happened. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=181.7s)]
*  What we saw last night was the president's let them eat cake moment. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=186.06s)]
*  Millions of Americans are suffering because of the mismanagement of this economy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=191.54s)]
*  I say this frequently, we're seeing record numbers of foreclosures. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=197.62s)]
*  People are having their cars repossessed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=202.06s)]
*  We are seeing a silent job loss because the reports are now showing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=205.66s)]
*  that the actual growth in employment is in part-time jobs, not in full-time jobs. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=211.62s)]
*  It is totally and completely unseemly in this economic environment for our president to say [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=219.22s)]
*  that we're going to try to set a record for the amount raised. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=228.34s)]
*  No money to help people buy eggs and bacon. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=234.66s)]
*  No money to make sure that people can afford gasoline. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=238.82s)]
*  When President Trump was in charge, millions of Americans, the majority of Americans succeeded. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=244.34s)]
*  They prospered. They were able to purchase cars. They were able to get homes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=255.22s)]
*  It is remarkable the divergence between the real priorities of this president that we have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  and his challenger, former President Trump, who was willing to take time and contribute [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=269.3s)]
*  to pay off the mortgage of that slain officer's family. What a contrast. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  Caroline, you're close to the president. You obviously act as his spokesperson. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  My experience with President Trump, he does speak with his heart. He really does care [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=291.94000000000005s)]
*  about these officers. But at the same time, you've got to find the right balance, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=295.94s)]
*  right? Because you don't want to disrupt a family and the greater New York City Police Department [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=301.54s)]
*  in what they're trying to deal with. But how do you think the president handled it? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=307.06s)]
*  And what should have Joe Biden done? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=311.38s)]
*  Well, yesterday, Americans witnessed the grave contrast that will be before them on the ballot [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=315.14s)]
*  on November the 5th. You have a man of the people in President Trump who humbly accepted [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=320.02s)]
*  the invitation from Officer Diller's family to pay his respects, to honor the life and the legacy [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=325.62s)]
*  of one of the NYPD's heroes. And just a few miles up the road, you had Joe Biden, a corrupt career [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=331.86s)]
*  politician, joking and laughing with limousine liberals and out of touch elitists and big donors [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=338.42s)]
*  who are striking big checks to his campaign, many of whom support the very soft on crime and defund [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=344.98s)]
*  the police policies that led to the heinous killing of Officer Diller that led to his [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=351.38s)]
*  murderer being arrested and released 21 times prior. And this is not the first time Americans [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=357.7s)]
*  have witnessed this grave contrast between the two presidents they can pick from on election day. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=364.5s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago, I was with President Trump in the great state of Georgia, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=369.7s)]
*  where he consoled another grieving American family, the parents of Lakin Riley, whose beautiful [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=373.54s)]
*  daughter was killed at the hands of an illegal immigrant who Joe Biden allowed into this country [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=379.06s)]
*  and who was also arrested in New York for injuring a child and then released. How many more Americans [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=383.94s)]
*  need to die because of Joe Biden's lawless and feckless policies before he actually cares? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=389.86s)]
*  The truth is he doesn't care about the American people. Joe Biden has always cared about one [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=396.02s)]
*  thing and that is power and control. He spent decades in quote unquote public service ripping [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=400.98s)]
*  off Americans. That's why the American people are choosing President Trump in the polls [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=406.66s)]
*  and he's winning in every single battleground state right now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=411.62s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, Tammy Bruce, Horace Cooper, happy Easter to you. Thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMJMZlIfNLI&t=416.90000000000003s)]
