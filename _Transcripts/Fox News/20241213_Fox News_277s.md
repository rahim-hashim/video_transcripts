# GOP senator on NJ drones: The Biden admin doesn't impose accountability
**Fox News:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4)
*  Senator Tom Cotton, Senator, great to have you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm having a hard time understanding where Joe Biden is, Kamala Harris is, where the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=4.76s)]
*  FBI is, where is Mayorkas on this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=9.92s)]
*  The first drone was spotted November the 18th. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=15.68s)]
*  The governor of New Jersey says they're very sophisticated. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=18.6s)]
*  The minute you get your eyes on them, they go dark. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=21.44s)]
*  But there's no evidence of a threat to public safety. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=23.88s)]
*  No concern for public safety. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=28.16s)]
*  There were 49 sightings on Sunday alone, Senator. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  Tell me, it may end up being nothing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=36.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=38.4s)]
*  But the size of a bus, and they're flying all over the place, and our government, since [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=39.56s)]
*  November 18th, can't figure out where they came from, who's operating them, what they're [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  doing, what they're capable of? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  That seems like a national security threat to me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=52.28s)]
*  Sean, thanks for having me on again. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=57.08s)]
*  This isn't the first time we haven't been able to figure out where Joe Biden is. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=59.8s)]
*  And I can tell you it's not just you, Sean. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=63.24s)]
*  I've been on the Armed Services Committee. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=65.6s)]
*  I've been on the Intelligence Committee now for 10 years. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=67.2s)]
*  And we haven't gotten adequate answers from the Biden administration either. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=70.08s)]
*  And it's not just these drones most recently over in New Jersey. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=73.0s)]
*  In recent months, there have been numerous drones flying over Langley Air Force Base [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=76.12s)]
*  in Virginia. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  And again, we don't get any satisfactory answers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  Perhaps, as you say, it's something innocuous, just hobbyist or pranksters. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=83.6s)]
*  But I don't think it serves the public interest to have the Biden administration or Democratic [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  governors go out trying to allay concerns when they have no factual basis to allay those [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=92.9s)]
*  concerns. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=98.4s)]
*  I can tell you the answers that you're not getting in public are the same answers that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=99.4s)]
*  we're not getting in private. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=102.84s)]
*  It's just one more example of how the Biden administration doesn't impose accountability, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=103.84s)]
*  point to a single official or agency and say, you're in charge here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  I've introduced legislation about, say, sporting events, working with Major League Baseball, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=114.16s)]
*  the NFL and SEC about trying to give local authorities the control and necessary resources [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  and authority they need to take down drones and airspace near a big football game or a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  baseball game. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=130.6s)]
*  Likewise, to say Northern Command, which is responsible in our military for protecting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=132.0s)]
*  the homeland, the authority to take them down around military bases. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=136.36s)]
*  The Biden administration has not supported that legislation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=139.68s)]
*  It's not going to go into effect. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=142.04s)]
*  But I think you can expect something different from President Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=144.04s)]
*  You can expect accountability. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=146.48s)]
*  A single person and a single agency in charge. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=148.12s)]
*  There will be one throat to choke. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=150.24s)]
*  He will get answers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=152.16s)]
*  We will protect our homeland. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=153.3s)]
*  So let me see if I'm capturing the moment we're living through properly. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=155.4s)]
*  We've been told over and over again by outgoing FBI Director Wray that the threat level has [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=159.6s)]
*  never been this bad, never been higher. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=165.12s)]
*  We've been told that there are Iranian assassination squads in the country that want to kill Donald Trump. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=167.72s)]
*  We've had two assassination attempts. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=173.92s)]
*  We know we have known terrorists in the country, but we don't know where they are. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=176.0s)]
*  Cartel members, gang members in the country, but we don't know where they are. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=179.92s)]
*  We've had the Trump campaign hacked by both China and by Iran. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=183.84s)]
*  And now we've got drones the size of a bus that sounds like a Harley flying all over [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  the state of New Jersey. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=192.92s)]
*  And since November 18th, nobody has a clue who's operating them, whether or not it's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  a foreign adversary or what threat it may be representing to the American people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=200.32s)]
*  Tell me, that's a state of security in America today? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=207.6s)]
*  That's about right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=212.24s)]
*  Don't forget the drones that were flying over Langley Air Force Base as well earlier [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=213.24s)]
*  this year. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=216.2s)]
*  Don't forget the Chinese spy balloon that Joe Biden let float all across America and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=217.2s)]
*  would have not even taken action if it hadn't been spotted by some ranchers in Montana. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=220.64s)]
*  Again, like you say, maybe this is innocuous. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=225.56s)]
*  But maybe next time it's going to be carrying sarin or VX or some other kind of deadly toxin [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=228.12s)]
*  for our people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=233.0s)]
*  That's why we can't assume that these things are not threatening. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=234.0s)]
*  We have to assume that something could be up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=238.04s)]
*  We have to impose accountability on the officials and agencies that are responsible for our [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=240.64s)]
*  homeland. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=246.28s)]
*  That's exactly what we'll do starting next year. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=247.28s)]
*  The fact that they don't know, the fact that there is no urgency is what is driving me [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  insane. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=256.0s)]
*  I mean, that is incompetence at the highest level. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=257.0s)]
*  Senator, great to see you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  Hopefully we'll have an answer maybe tomorrow night with a little bit of luck. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40gyhWuj0T4&t=262.4s)]
