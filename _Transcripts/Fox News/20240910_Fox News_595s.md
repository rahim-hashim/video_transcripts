# Donald Trump: This debate was 'stacked'
**Fox News:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw)
*  I feel good. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=1.0s)]
*  Joining us now, he's on the set in the spin room himself. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=2.0s)]
*  Did you have fun? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=4.28s)]
*  I had a good time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=5.76s)]
*  I think it was our best debate ever. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=7.0s)]
*  I thought it was really good. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  We had three against one, but I anticipated it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=10.08s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=12.6s)]
*  Three against one, and all of her radical positions, they leave on the table. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=13.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=17.92s)]
*  Now, we had a lot of negative kind of stuff. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=18.92s)]
*  Look, I saw on your show last night, they had 100 percent positive coverage on ABC. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=21.96s)]
*  And I had 94 percent negative coverage. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=29.4s)]
*  93. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=31.4s)]
*  93 percent negative. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=32.4s)]
*  I exactly. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=33.4s)]
*  You got an extra percent non-negative. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=34.4s)]
*  As you were with her tonight, to think that we come out of this debate and we have no [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  answer to her co-sponsoring the Green New Deal — $93 trillion — I say the end of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=41.08s)]
*  capitalism — to come out of this, you know, government-run healthcare and no answer to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=46.44s)]
*  eliminating private health insurance — [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=52.739999999999995s)]
*  Well, we brought them all up. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=54.36s)]
*  You know, every one of the things that you — [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=56.68s)]
*  We did bring a lot of it up. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=57.68s)]
*  And I also ended with, why hasn't she done it before? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=59.0s)]
*  Why didn't she fix — you know, she's there complaining. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=62.44s)]
*  Why didn't she fix all these things that she's complaining about? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=64.8s)]
*  Were you really willing to leave the stage and go home if she was going to go fix it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=66.8s)]
*  in Washington? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=70.12s)]
*  No, you know what? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=71.12s)]
*  I would have left. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=72.12s)]
*  I would have said, go home and fix it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=73.12s)]
*  I'll leave with you, OK? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=74.12s)]
*  But she doesn't — she's not going to fix it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=75.44s)]
*  So she's complaining about all the stuff that's wrong with the country, and they've [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=77.76s)]
*  been there for three and a half years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=80.76s)]
*  And I put that — I wanted to save that for my last little summation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=83.12s)]
*  And I actually mentioned — in there, too. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=86.48s)]
*  I just thought it was a great debate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  I think we showed the weakness. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  But the sad part is they're destroying our country, you know, when you get right down [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  to it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  Debate, good debate. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  I enjoyed it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  But it's a very sad thing, because our country is in decline. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=99.54s)]
*  We are really being laughed at all over the world. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=102.28s)]
*  And that's tough to take. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=105.48s)]
*  Do you think it's strange that somebody could support something as radical as sex [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=107.44s)]
*  change operations paid for by taxpayers for convicts and illegal immigrants and for illegal [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=113.68s)]
*  immigrants free housing, healthcare, education, and not get asked a question about it? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=119.76s)]
*  And — but I brought it up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=124.28s)]
*  You did bring it up. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=125.72000000000001s)]
*  Of course, they weren't so happy when I brought it up, but I brought it up. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=126.72000000000001s)]
*  I brought up the fact that they're doing sex change operations on illegal immigrants, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=128.72s)]
*  and those are expensive operations, and they shouldn't be done for a lot of reasons. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=133.32s)]
*  There were a lot of things said that weren't true about you tonight, that you would support [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=136.8s)]
*  a national abortion ban. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=139.68s)]
*  You've never said that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=140.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=141.88s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=143.88s)]
*  You never read it? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=144.88s)]
*  I don't even know what it is, either. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=145.88s)]
*  I don't want to read it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=146.88s)]
*  OK, number two. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=147.88s)]
*  That — she said in 2000, I took back my position on banning fracking. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=148.88s)]
*  No, CNN fact-checked that and said no. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=152.88s)]
*  The mandatory gun buyback at the end of the debate, she lied about that, too. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=159.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=160.76s)]
*  And you did call her out for a lot of that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=161.76s)]
*  She wants to confiscate — I called her out on everything that you said. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=162.76s)]
*  I think I got everything out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=165.16s)]
*  Now, with all of that being said, I was amazed, because I really thought that it'd be fair. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=166.8s)]
*  I have to say, CNN, a few weeks ago, was sort of fair against Biden. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=170.84s)]
*  But this one was stacked — I figured it would be after watching 100 percent positive [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=176.28s)]
*  coverage of her. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  And she's done a terrible job as vice president. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  And look, she's the worst vice president we've ever had. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  She was the border czar — the worst border ever in the history of the world, not just [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  in our country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=192.44s)]
*  And he's the worst president we've ever had. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=193.88000000000002s)]
*  So she's — it hurt to be — [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=195.96s)]
*  Sean, they're destroying our country. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=196.96s)]
*  I'm very aware. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  And if we look at her tax plan, which is — OK, price gauging or gouging, and the largest [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  tax increase not only in American history but world history, her campaign is saying [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=207.12s)]
*  tonight, Washington Post is reporting that she wants a second debate. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=211.8s)]
*  What's your answer? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  That's because she lost. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  She wants it because she lost. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=217.56s)]
*  Do you have an answer? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=218.72s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=219.72s)]
*  I have to think about it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=220.72s)]
*  But if you won the debate, I sort of think maybe I shouldn't do it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=222.08s)]
*  Why should I do another debate? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  She immediately said, we want another debate. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=227.8s)]
*  You know what happens? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=229.88s)]
*  When you're a prizefighter and you lose, you immediately want a new fight. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=230.88s)]
*  You want a rematch. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=234.2s)]
*  You want a rematch. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=235.2s)]
*  The guy that won is sort of happy and thinking about it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=236.2s)]
*  Would you be inclined to say yes, or you don't know? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=238.64s)]
*  Maybe if it was a fair network, I would do that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=240.92s)]
*  But — [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=243.44s)]
*  I think let Hannity moderate it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=244.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think — [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=245.76s)]
*  Like I did Newsom and Rondo-Santos. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=246.76s)]
*  I think it would be fair. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=247.76s)]
*  You would be fair, actually. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=248.76s)]
*  I would be fair. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=249.76s)]
*  You want to know the truth. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=250.76s)]
*  I'd let you both talk. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=251.76s)]
*  I'd let you go at each other. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=252.76s)]
*  I thought they would be fair. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=253.76s)]
*  They weren't. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=254.76s)]
*  But I felt very comfortable. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=255.76s)]
*  We have the best policy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  He has no policy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=258.88s)]
*  You know, one thing that interested me, because I've known you for a long time, and one of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=259.88s)]
*  the things that I was watching in you tonight is that you were just — you were all business. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=263.44s)]
*  You know, a lot of times when you're at your rallies or we do a town hall — [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=270.12s)]
*  No, I'm not doing that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=273.0s)]
*  Sean, they're destroying our country. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=274.0s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=275.0s)]
*  Is it the seriousness of the moment? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=276.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's nothing — there's nothing to smile about. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=277.0s)]
*  You know, I can — I'm a good smiler. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=279.09999999999997s)]
*  But there's nothing to smile about. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=281.7s)]
*  They're destroying — we have 21 million people that have been released into our country, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=283.24s)]
*  and many of them are criminals and terrorists and people from mental institutions. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=288.0s)]
*  Lake and Riley, Rachel Moran, Jocelyn Nungary. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=292.4s)]
*  All dead. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=294.4s)]
*  You know, I list all these names on the show of people murdered, people raped, people victims [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=295.4s)]
*  of violent crime — names a lot of people never heard of. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=300.4s)]
*  You've called Lake and Riley's family. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=303.68s)]
*  I did. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  I was with them. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  I was with them. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  Who else do? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  You've met all their families. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  She was incredible. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  You met the families of — [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  I met them all. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  Nungary. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  I met — [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  You met Nungary's family. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm not even talking about the 13 soldiers that were killed in Afghanistan, the families [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=317.36s)]
*  of the 13 soldiers, which Biden won't even talk to. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=321.68s)]
*  And he's the one that caused their death. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  Just as if he had a pistol in his hand, he and her caused their death. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=327.36s)]
*  Just as if, literally, they had a gun in their hand. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty amazing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  When you're in a situation like that, what is going through your mind? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=337.12s)]
*  What goes on behind the scenes? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=342.0s)]
*  How do you prepare for your debates? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=344.12s)]
*  Well, I think you sort of — I always say I've been preparing all my life for these [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  debates. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=350.24s)]
*  You know, you can't go in like she did. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=351.24s)]
*  She goes into a room and she memorized lines, more or less. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=352.48s)]
*  I thought I got one cute one. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=356.36s)]
*  I'm talking, where I said, I'm talking, when she started interrupting me. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=357.6s)]
*  She said that to Mike Pence. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=361.16s)]
*  I'm speaking. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=362.16s)]
*  I wanted to get even for that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=363.16s)]
*  That was not very nice, what she did. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=364.16s)]
*  But no, I thought it was — we're getting great reviews. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  It's interesting that the one thing — one line that really stuck out that did make me [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=369.76s)]
*  laugh out loud is when you said you were going to send her a MAGA hat. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=373.48s)]
*  There are a lot of positions now, all of a sudden, she's come over to your side. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=376.76s)]
*  She's been against the border wall. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=380.72s)]
*  She's been against — [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=381.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=382.72s)]
*  There's only one problem. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=383.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=384.72s)]
*  If she ever won immediately, from the day after that election, everything would go back [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=385.72s)]
*  to confiscate your guns and forget about oil and everything else. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=388.24s)]
*  You know, they were cutting back on oil way back. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=392.6s)]
*  They got rid of ANWR, the biggest oil site, perhaps, in the world, in Alaska. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=394.8s)]
*  They did things that are so bad and so destructive, but energy prices started doubling up, and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=399.64s)]
*  she immediately went back to the Trump plan. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=406.4s)]
*  But I would have been now four times higher than they are right now, because that was [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=409.52s)]
*  three and a half years ago. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=413.34s)]
*  When she cut it, she cut everything out. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=415.34s)]
*  She went to wind and went to all this other stuff that doesn't work, from an economic [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=416.84s)]
*  standpoint, and even a visual standpoint. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=421.2s)]
*  I don't get the wind. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=423.2s)]
*  You take these gorgeous plains and deserts and all this stuff. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=424.96s)]
*  They put these windmills up. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=428.84s)]
*  They go up like a 30-story building in some cases. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=430.08s)]
*  They destroy everything. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=433.76s)]
*  They cut out all — and the environmentalists say, aren't they wonderful? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=435.0s)]
*  But it's the most expensive form of energy, and it's never going to do for our country. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=437.64s)]
*  So if we look at the issues on the economy, on immigration, on law and order, on energy, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=441.44s)]
*  and America's role in the world — [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=449.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=451.44s)]
*  It was all covered. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=452.44s)]
*  Is there anything you could point to that you would say they have been successful on? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=453.44s)]
*  No. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=457.12s)]
*  They've been unsuccessful at everything. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=458.2s)]
*  And even the economy, as part of the economy, you've let 21 million people — more than [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  that, I think, with all the gotaways. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=465.48s)]
*  That's killing our economy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=466.48s)]
*  By the way, including young terrorists — and we do have the murders and the rapes and the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=467.48s)]
*  violent crimes. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=471.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=472.48s)]
*  Oh, and you haven't seen anything yet. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=473.48s)]
*  Where do you see it in the months to come? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=474.48s)]
*  You know, what scares me — and I've said this on the air — is, by having open borders, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=475.48s)]
*  unvetted illegal immigrants, that I don't think it's a matter of if. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=480.12s)]
*  I think it's a matter of when that this country is going to be attacked. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=484.04s)]
*  If you look at Springfield, Ohio, look at what's happening there. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=487.12s)]
*  You look at Aurora in Colorado. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=491.68s)]
*  These beautiful little towns and little cities, small cities, they're being taken over by [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=494.12s)]
*  illegal migrants. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the people that poured in — and they have weapons like our military doesn't have. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, they have AK-47s. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=504.96s)]
*  They have weapons like our military doesn't have. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=506.64s)]
*  And you know, some sheriff in one of these towns, where he's got two deputies, and they're [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  not into this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=515.0799999999999s)]
*  There's no way they could protect the people from this. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=516.24s)]
*  But look at what's going on in Springfield today. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=518.76s)]
*  It's — nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  I know your people are calling for you to roll. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  What made you come to the Spindler? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  I just felt I wanted to. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  I was very happy with the result. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=530.48s)]
*  It's a very unfair situation. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=532.64s)]
*  They've weaponized our government politically, so I mean, that's unfair. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=535.08s)]
*  And I just felt we had a great night. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=539.08s)]
*  And I'd come over here, actually gave a little bit of a news conference. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=541.2800000000001s)]
*  We were swarmed. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=543.84s)]
*  Oh, by the way, I could hear it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=544.84s)]
*  You're interrupting my show, by the way, just for the record. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=546.6s)]
*  But I had to come over and do yours. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=548.2s)]
*  I would hate like heck to leave here and I didn't do a show. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=549.6s)]
*  No, I'd be mad. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  I would have been. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  I would take that as a personal offense. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=553.8000000000001s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=554.8000000000001s)]
*  I would have been in big trouble. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  So no answer on their offer for a second debate. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  Again, the reason you do a second debate is if you lose and they lost. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  And we looked at one poll. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=565.12s)]
*  It was 92 to 7. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  We looked at another one, 86 to 3. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=569.12s)]
*  I mean, we have all of these results coming in, but I'll think about it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=572.32s)]
*  You know, it's very quick. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=577.5600000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you for taking time. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=578.84s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqIbkN6rkw&t=580.76s)]
