# Mike Huckabee: We need to ‘bankrupt’ Iran
**Fox News:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA)
*  All right, here with reaction, Hoover Institution senior fellow, Victor Davis Hanson, former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=0.0s)]
*  governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, Governor Huckabee, start with you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=4.0s)]
*  When you look at the situation, what—well, first of all, why didn't he respond to the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=8.24s)]
*  nearly 200 previous attacks? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  How could you not respond at all and not have what happened over the weekend become inevitable? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=15.8s)]
*  Utter weakness, that's what we've seen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Everything that Colonel North just said, I would just want to say amen to it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=25.72s)]
*  What else can be said? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=29.92s)]
*  That was exactly what we need to be doing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=31.12s)]
*  I hear some people saying we need to go bomb Iran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=33.28s)]
*  Actually, what we need to do is what Donald Trump is doing, and that's bankrupting Iran. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=36.0s)]
*  That was effective. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=41.28s)]
*  It was working, and it was a far better approach. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=42.28s)]
*  Maybe we do need to bomb their refineries, but we don't need to just go after and start [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  another war. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  We need to do what Donald Trump was already doing, and it was effectively working. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=51.52s)]
*  I don't know why we don't do it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm so tired of hearing Democrats say, boy, isn't it great the Biden team is here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=57.72s)]
*  We got the adults back in the room. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  No, what we got was senior adults in the room that don't know what day it is. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  For God's sake, we've got to have some people who are looking at this situation with the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=68.16s)]
*  danger it is. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=72.4s)]
*  What Colonel North said is exactly the prescription. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=73.64s)]
*  Maybe Trump gets elected and names him secretary of defense. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=76.52s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=80.36s)]
*  Donald Trump also took out Soleimani, Victor Davis Hanson. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=81.36s)]
*  I don't want America in a long, protracted war. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  However, we do have new military, sophisticated military technology where we can push a button [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  here in the United States and with pinpoint accuracy hit any darn target we want inside [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  of Iran, can't we? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=99.28s)]
*  Yeah, we can, and that's why Iran knows that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  Generally, in history, if you are perceived that you'll do anything for peace, you're [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  going to guarantee a war. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=111.04s)]
*  It's predictable that our response is scripted. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  We say three things. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  First, we say we're going to respond to the time and place of our choosing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=117.72s)]
*  They're tired of that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=123.2s)]
*  Second, we say while Iran has supplied these surrogates, we don't have any direct evidence [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  that it's Iran. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=129.72s)]
*  And third, we want to avoid a wider war. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=130.72s)]
*  That's all nice things, but the message that they take from that is that there's a magic [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=133.16s)]
*  number that we haven't reached yet. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=137.96s)]
*  They think, is it 50? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  Is it 100? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=141.68s)]
*  Is it 150? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=143.52s)]
*  Let's try 200 attacks. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=144.52s)]
*  Is it six dead Americans, eight dead, 50 wounded? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=145.52s)]
*  And they keep upping it to find out where they have to pull back for a while. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=148.72s)]
*  But the problem is that deterrence is, Sean, it's really hard to achieve and it's very [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  easy to throw away. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  When they came in, Donald Trump killed Soleimani. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=159.72s)]
*  He took the terrorist, the Houthis, he put sanctions on them, he cut off Hamas, he didn't [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=163.36s)]
*  want to get into the Iran deal, he rejected it, he put in the sanctions on the oil, he [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=170.76s)]
*  had the Abrams Accord, he had no daylight between us and Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=175.6s)]
*  And then when he got rid of Soleimani, he didn't have to bomb Iran because they understood [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=180.24s)]
*  that they were in very deep peril. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=185.92s)]
*  But when you lose deterrence, then finally you're going to get to the point where your [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=188.64s)]
*  only option is a war. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=192.34s)]
*  And we don't want that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=193.76s)]
*  And yet, ironically and paradoxically, that's exactly where Biden is leading us, to a theater-wide [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=195.04s)]
*  war. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=201.44s)]
*  The more that he says he wants to prevent it and the more he appeases these people that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=202.44s)]
*  think they're going to have a magic number until they're going to keep going until they're [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=206.2s)]
*  forced to stop. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=211.16s)]
*  And we don't want a war, but I don't know if he doesn't re-enter the Trump protocols [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=212.16s)]
*  and the sanctions and all of the terrorist listing, we're going to have a war. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  And that's unfortunate. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=222.04s)]
*  But that's what we'll get down to if Biden keeps it up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  There's got to be, I think you'd agree and both of you would agree, and I'll ask you [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=226.83999999999997s)]
*  an exit question. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=230.6s)]
*  There's got to be a proportional response here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=231.6s)]
*  And to me, I think we're all kind of on the same page. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't know maybe the right way to go about it, but we've got to cut off their financing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=237.0s)]
*  here because the money is financing the proxy wars and the terror attacks all over the globe. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=241.76s)]
*  To do that, to me, the surest way to do it would be to take out their refineries. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=248.2s)]
*  I also think that would be proportional. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=252.16s)]
*  Mike Huckabee, what do you say? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  I agree that you can take specific targets. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=257.84s)]
*  You don't have civilian casualties. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  You also go after these proxies and hit them hard, hit them real hard. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=263.24s)]
*  But ultimately, it's bankrupting. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=267.56s)]
*  But let them know that if that doesn't work, the bombing will start. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=269.92s)]
*  But let's pray to God that Victor Davis Hansen is right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=273.08s)]
*  The last thing we need or want is an all-out war. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=275.56s)]
*  I think we can avoid it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=278.76s)]
*  Trump proved that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=280.12s)]
*  I hope we continue that strategy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=281.2s)]
*  Would it be wise to take out their refineries, Victor Davis Hansen? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=282.6s)]
*  If we get to that, we're going to have to. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=288.72s)]
*  But I think it's much better to be quiet and carry a club than loud with a twig. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=290.48s)]
*  And the louder we are and the more predictable we are, the closer we're going to get to war. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  You should just keep quiet. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=299.64s)]
*  And I think you should be disproportionate, disproportionate. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=301.12s)]
*  And then that will stop it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=304.6s)]
*  But he's too loud and he's too weak and he's too predictable. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=306.2s)]
*  And that's dangerous. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=309.96s)]
*  And deterrent strategy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  And nobody respects him. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  And China's going to keep buying Iranian oil anyway. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  But I appreciate you both. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=316.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqWALrmLoA&t=318.15999999999997s)]
