# Hannity: Biden needs to leave the White House
**Fox News:** [July 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0)
*  All right, welcome to Hannity. And this is a Fox News alert. Well, democracy is dead [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Democratic Party. The elitist coup led by Washington, D.C., Hollywood elitists, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=5.28s)]
*  Democratic big-money donors, it worked. The surrogates, Obama, Clooney, Schumer, Pelosi, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=11.96s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, they all assisted, interestingly, in this whole, quote, coup, if you want to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=17.96s)]
*  call it that, Operation Dump and Destroy Biden. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=24.64s)]
*  But interestingly, as of this hour, Obama, Pelosi, Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries are the most [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=28.6s)]
*  prominent Democrats not to endorse Kamala Harris. So after lying to all of you, the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  entire country, every voter, for years about Joe Biden's obvious cognitive decline, Joe [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=42.16s)]
*  Biden bowed to the pressure, officially dropped out of the 2024 race, rendering the millions [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  and millions of Democratic primary voters null and void. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  We are only 58 days before early voting gets underway in Pennsylvania and then rolls out in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=58.44s)]
*  other states. We are only 106 days before the election. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  Now, party elites will bypass the people in their own party and handpick the next Democratic [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  nominee, the party that waxes so poetic about the importance of voting and democracy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=75.24s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=82.24s)]
*  Oh, it's on the ballot. Not exactly the way they've been characterizing it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  It does. They don't actually care about either of these things. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=88.28s)]
*  Joe Biden, many other top Democrats have endorsed Biden's border czar, Kamala Harris, who [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=92.08s)]
*  dropped out of the 2020 Democratic primary before a single vote was even cast. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=97.84s)]
*  We're going to have a lot more on Kamala. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=102.6s)]
*  Stay tuned. That's in just a moment. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=104.44s)]
*  But first, let us just simply state the obvious. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=106.08s)]
*  If Joe Biden is not capable of handling the rigors of a campaign, which almost every [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  Democrat is admitting to, then he certainly is not capable of fulfilling the duties of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  president of our country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=123.2s)]
*  That would mean Joe Biden does need to resign as soon as possible, take his family of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=125.32s)]
*  grifters back to Delaware. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=130.76s)]
*  If he had any decency at all, he would leave the White House this week and never come [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  back. Think about this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=137.44s)]
*  We haven't even seen Joe Biden today. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=139.39999999999998s)]
*  His decision announced that a letter posted on X apparently he was unable or unwilling [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  to even step in front of a camera and announced this historic decision in person. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=148.92s)]
*  If he's unwilling to do this, then frankly, his cabinet ought to be invoking immediately [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=154.44s)]
*  the 25th Amendment. They ought to be doing it tonight and they ought to be removing him [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=159.48s)]
*  from office. And with all that said, Joe Biden, in all truth, has never been up to the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  job. We have shown you his cognitive decline since before the 2020 election. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=169.48s)]
*  Almost everybody in the Democratic Party and the state-run media mob, they all have lied [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=175.12s)]
*  to all of you since 2020. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=181.56s)]
*  They have all known this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=184.88s)]
*  They have all covered it up. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  This is the same media mob that let Joe Biden hide in his basement in the election in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=188.44s)]
*  2020, the same people that lied about Hunter's laptop and organized 51 former Intel [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=194.68s)]
*  officials that knew nothing about that laptop to lie to all of you in the weeks before the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=202.76s)]
*  2020 election. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  None of them had ever seen the laptop. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=210.84s)]
*  They didn't know a thing about it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=212.84s)]
*  The same state-run media mob, the same Democratic Party that had no problem with Hillary [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=214.64s)]
*  Clinton's dirty Russian disinformation dossier that she paid for, the same one used to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=220.2s)]
*  acquire four FISA warrants to spy on a candidate and later President Trump through a backdoor. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=226.48s)]
*  The same people that had no problem with Hillary deleting 33,000 subpoenaed emails, the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=233.44s)]
*  same people that had no problem with her top secret classified information all over her [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=239.88s)]
*  servers, the same people that had no problem with Mar-a-Lago falsely valued at 18 million [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  dollars by an abusively biased New York judge, the same people that had no problem with a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=251.6s)]
*  legal NDA negotiated by a lawyer labeled as a legal expense, no problem with the weaponization [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=257.48s)]
*  of our Justice Department, lawfare used against Donald Trump with a criminal indictment. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=264.52s)]
*  Misdemeanor well past the statute of limitations, upcharge to 34 felony counts in a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=270.28s)]
*  jurisdiction he'd never get a fair trial in with a judge, again, corrupt, abusively biased. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=278.08s)]
*  These same people will now champion Biden's replacement. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=284.32s)]
*  Let me predict this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=288.32s)]
*  Whoever it is, let's assume for a moment Kamala Harris, it will be defended as the second [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=289.76s)]
*  coming of Jesus just to defeat Trump. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=295.36s)]
*  Democrats, the state propagandists, they are leftists, they are Marxists. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=299.36s)]
*  They will do, they will say anything to stop Trump and hold on to power. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  As Governor DeSantis said, this includes the weekend at Bernie's charade that we've all [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  witnessed at the White House for the past four years. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=314.32s)]
*  The single biggest lie campaign and cover up in modern American history. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  Who's responsible? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  And while Joe and Jill treated the White House like a luxurious publicly funded retirement [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  home, these bureaucrats carried out the left's radical agenda, shamelessly telling all of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  you that Joe Biden was full of vigor, the smartest person in the room. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=336.8s)]
*  They said that he could run circles around his young staffers behind closed doors. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=341.44s)]
*  They said they had a hard time keeping up with Joe. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=346.24s)]
*  They said that Joe accomplished more in an hour than most of you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=349.44s)]
*  Most Americans do in an entire day. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=353.04s)]
*  All blatant lies. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  They used Joe Biden as a front man. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  And perhaps no one was more duplicitous than Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=360.48s)]
*  Joe's vice president joined him for weekly lunches. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=365.92s)]
*  She and Joe supposedly worked on big issues together like the border crisis. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=369.04s)]
*  That's a joke, but that's what they claim. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=374.24s)]
*  And then they frequently appeared in public together when Biden's cognitive decline was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=376.8s)]
*  on full display. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  Just a reminder. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=383.04s)]
*  I'm not being facetious. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=414.0s)]
*  Well, President Harris led this effort, led this effort to make things better. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=416.88s)]
*  And a pound of Ukrainian people, proud, proud people, pound for pound, ready to fight with [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=421.76000000000005s)]
*  every inch of earnings that they have. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=427.68s)]
*  Tonight, every American needs to be asking, what did Kamala know about his cognitive state? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=430.88s)]
*  When did she know it? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=435.76s)]
*  What did every other Democrat know about this? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  When did they know it? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=439.76s)]
*  Why did she and every Democrat lie about Joe's cognitive decline? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=441.12s)]
*  How did Democratic elites eventually push Biden to the curb? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, he was defiant until the last possible minute. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=448.8s)]
*  Did Kamala and other Democrats make a deal with Joe? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  She must be forced to answer these questions. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  Not that I'd expect an honest answer. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=458.16s)]
*  And of course, a state-run media mob of a nothing but Pravda, state-run media dupes, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=460.56s)]
*  pushing the lie complicit in the cover-up the whole time. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=466.48s)]
*  Kamala, others also need to answer for her horrendous track record, her far-left policy [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=470.32s)]
*  positions. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=476.48s)]
*  Not only does Kamala own every one of Joe Biden and that administration's failures, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=477.36s)]
*  but if she becomes the nominee, she will be the single most radical major party candidate [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=482.72s)]
*  to run for election, even more radical than Obama. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=488.72s)]
*  And that's saying something, so radical that during the 2020 Democratic Party, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  you know, primary, you know, she didn't even make it to New Hampshire and Iowa, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=497.2s)]
*  dropping out in 2019 after polling in the single digits. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=501.44s)]
*  As a senator, she co-sponsored a bill with Bernie Sanders that would force Americans [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=505.36s)]
*  into socialized, singer-pair healthcare, that kind of system. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=510.24s)]
*  She also sponsored a bill to prohibit drilling for oil in the Pacific Atlantic Ocean. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=514.24s)]
*  She called for an end to all fracking. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=519.28s)]
*  She supported the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=521.36s)]
*  Had no problem giving a waiver to Vladimir Putin on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=525.68s)]
*  The Keystone XL would have created, you know, thousands and thousands of high-paying career [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=530.64s)]
*  jobs. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=535.5999999999999s)]
*  We would be getting 9 million barrels of oil from Canada a day as of now, while she [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=536.16s)]
*  efficiently—while, of course, that would be efficiently transporting North American [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  oil and gas to American refineries. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=546.0s)]
*  Well, recently, she even bragged about an agreement to completely phase out fossil fuels, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=548.4799999999999s)]

*  She wants to ban plastic straws. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=556.56s)]
*  I love my plastic straw. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=559.28s)]
*  I hate those paper straws. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=560.72s)]
*  Anyway, but Kamala is so radical that she even sued the Obama administration to prevent [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=562.24s)]
*  them from fracking while she was serving as the attorney general of California. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=569.04s)]
*  And Kamala even spearheaded efforts in the Senate to pass AOC's insane Green New Deal [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=573.52s)]
*  and vowed to eliminate the filibuster to get it done. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=580.16s)]
*  In 2020, four days after that Minneapolis police precinct was burned to the ground [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=583.3599999999999s)]
*  by violent rioters—not mostly peaceful, violent—Kamala tweeted out this link to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=588.4799999999999s)]
*  the Minnesota Bail Fund, calling on her following to chip in and help post bail for these criminals. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=594.88s)]
*  After Kamala promoted the fund, its annual revenue reportedly jumped from about a quarter [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=601.04s)]
*  of a million dollars in 2019 to a whopping $42 million in 2020. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=605.92s)]
*  How did Kamala's favorite bail fund spend that money? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=612.8s)]
*  Well, in August of 2021, the fund bailed out a man who had just been arrested on domestic [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=615.68s)]
*  assault charges. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=620.8s)]
*  Three weeks later, he got into a road rage incident and reportedly shot and killed a [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  38-year-old man. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  In 2022, the fund bailed out another man who was facing indecent exposure charges. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=628.56s)]
*  A short while later, he allegedly shot and killed another man at a light rail station [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=634.56s)]
*  in St. Paul. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=639.36s)]
*  A jury convicted him of first-degree murder over the incident. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=640.56s)]
*  Overall, according to even Fake News CNN and their investigation, 65 people were bailed [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=644.4s)]
*  out of that Freedom Fund by that Freedom Fund while facing serious felony charges for violent [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=650.7199999999999s)]
*  crimes, sex crimes, and guess what? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=656.4799999999999s)]
*  All of those perpetrators, they were eventually convicted on those charges. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  But thanks in no part to Kamala Harris, all of these offenders were able to live among [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=663.68s)]
*  your families for months, even years. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=668.96s)]
*  But Kamala's radical track record doesn't end there. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  As vice president, she praised this year's hateful, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel riots on [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=675.12s)]
*  the left, even as her own administration revealed that Iran is funding these so-called [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=680.88s)]
*  demonstrations. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=686.24s)]
*  Law and order means nothing to Kamala Harris, so it's no surprise that her role as border [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=687.68s)]
*  czar has been an abject failure. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=692.96s)]
*  Aside from one short visit to El Paso, Kamala Harris hasn't lifted a finger to secure the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=695.36s)]
*  border. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=700.56s)]
*  Under her watch and Joe's watch, a record of 10-plus unvetted illegal immigrants from [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=701.36s)]
*  over 175 countries have poured into our country, including people, a record number of suspected [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=707.04s)]
*  terrorists, gang members, other criminals, other special-interest aliens from America's [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=714.24s)]
*  top geopolitical foes, people from countries with terror ties. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=719.8399999999999s)]
*  Her problems don't end there. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=724.64s)]
*  Kamala Harris is also battling something called a likability crisis. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  Even after Biden's horrendous debate, she continued to underperform Joe and the polls. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=731.04s)]
*  Here's just one reason that voters seem to detest Kamala Harris. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=736.08s)]
*  You decide. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=740.4s)]
*  And is that a socialist or progressive perspective? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=754.64s)]
*  No. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=763.12s)]
*  I thought we were supposed to conserve things. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=765.12s)]
*  I couldn't reconcile it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=772.24s)]
*  Now I can. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=773.68s)]
*  Yes, you're giggling, Vice President. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=775.68s)]
*  Unfortunately for Democrats, it's not just the nervous laughter. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=780.32s)]
*  According to reports, Kamala often refuses to prepare for important events, then blames [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=783.7600000000001s)]
*  her staff when things go wrong. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, her public appearances are usually disjointed, confusing, cringeworthy, filled [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=790.88s)]
*  with platitudes about the significance of time. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=796.72s)]
*  We're all passing through time, which is the passage of time, and Venn diagrams, a [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=800.48s)]
*  case you've forgotten. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=806.24s)]
*  The largest investment ever to take on the climate crisis, roughly a trillion dollars [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=808.4s)]
*  with a T. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=814.08s)]
*  I had to. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=816.08s)]
*  You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=819.6s)]
*  You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=822.8s)]
*  One of the things I love are Venn diagrams. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=830.72s)]
*  I love Venn diagrams. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=837.04s)]
*  You need to get to go and need to be able to get where you need to go to do the work [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=839.92s)]
*  and get home. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=844.24s)]
*  The significance of the passage of time, right? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=845.24s)]
*  The significance of the passage of time. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=848.24s)]
*  So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=851.16s)]
*  More parents are seeing the value of educators when they had to bring their kids and saying, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=855.52s)]
*  I'm not paying them nearly enough. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=864.24s)]
*  It is time for us to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=868.24s)]
*  Every day it is time for us to agree. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=874.96s)]
*  We all believe that when we talk about the children of the community, they are the children [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=877.92s)]
*  of the community. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=882.84s)]
*  So Ukraine is a country in Europe. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=884.2s)]
*  It exists next to another country called Russia. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=889.0s)]
*  Russia is a bigger country. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=892.6400000000001s)]
*  Russia is a powerful country. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=894.1600000000001s)]
*  Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=895.84s)]
*  So basically that's wrong. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=899.72s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=903.96s)]
*  It's not a done deal for Kamala right now. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=904.96s)]
*  Many Democrats are polling better than she is, but according to Donald Trump, and he's [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=907.12s)]
*  right, it doesn't matter who the Democrats run because the policies will remain the same. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=912.44s)]
*  Period. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=918.44s)]
*  End of sentence. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=919.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=920.44s)]
*  So they're going to cook up something at the convention. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=921.44s)]
*  They might throw Gretchen Whitmer at you. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=924.24s)]
*  They might throw Gavin Newsom at you. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=926.72s)]
*  They might throw Michelle Obama at you. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=929.12s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't be worried about any of them. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=931.24s)]
*  Look, they have bad policies. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=933.5600000000001s)]
*  Forget about the people. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=935.08s)]
*  They have an open border policy. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=937.0400000000001s)]
*  They have a high tax policy. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=938.48s)]
*  They have a bad military policy. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=939.86s)]
*  The whole world is going woke. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=942.0s)]
*  Their world is going woke. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=943.44s)]
*  The Green New Scam was spending all our money on things that don't work. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=945.36s)]
*  The whole thing is a mess. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=949.56s)]
*  The president is a thousand percent correct. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=952.16s)]
*  The policies won't change. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=955.16s)]
*  The sad reality in this modern Democratic party is that they could nominate a dead person [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=956.5999999999999s)]
*  and it wouldn't matter the policies, the agenda, the positions. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=962.16s)]
*  They're decided by party elites and they speak with one voice. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=966.3199999999999s)]
*  Voters are the least important voice inside of that party. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=970.76s)]
*  They only listen to the donor class. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=974.16s)]
*  Hollywood elitists like that idiot George Clooney, Nantucket elitists like the Obamas, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=976.2s)]
*  the DC power hungry elitists like Pelosi, Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and the Democratic [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=981.6400000000001s)]
*  party, your vote doesn't matter. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=987.72s)]
*  That's why unions, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people, they're switching [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=990.88s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=996.12s)]
*  But tonight, Democrats face another huge problem. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=997.2800000000001s)]
*  The deadlines and regulations surrounding changing a candidate on a ballot, that varies [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1000.84s)]
*  from state to state. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1005.9399999999999s)]
*  And by the way, they are tedious to say the least. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1007.54s)]
*  For example, according to the Heritage Foundation, in Wisconsin, a ballot can't be changed unless [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1010.06s)]
*  a candidate dies. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1016.4599999999999s)]
*  And it's currently unclear if the regulation applies before an official nomination. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1018.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Nevada, a similar regulation applies. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1023.5s)]
*  But that state, after next Friday, no change can be made on that ballot for the general [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1027.22s)]
*  election for any reason. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1032.1399999999999s)]
*  Georgia, meanwhile, has regulations that require a convention for ballot changes. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1034.06s)]
*  Make no mistake, there will be legal challenges in multiple states all across the country. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1040.06s)]
*  And there is a chance that Biden's name will remain on the ballot in certain states. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1045.7s)]
*  Democrats don't want to be in this position, but they're desperate to maintain power. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1050.86s)]
*  It's all about beating Donald Trump at any cost. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1055.26s)]
*  For the party elitists beating Trump, staying in power, that's the only thing that matters. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVSklALRw0&t=1058.26s)]
