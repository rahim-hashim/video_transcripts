# Biden is clearly not in charge of his mental faculties: Sen. Josh Hawley
**Fox News:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc)
*  Anyway, joining us now with more, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley. Senator, great to have you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=0.0s)]
*  I want you to explain why this, what you're saying here is critical, because the special [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=5.04s)]
*  counsel's report said he willingly and knowingly kept these documents. That means he violated the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=11.76s)]
*  law. There was no raid, there's no charges, there was, you know, no comparison to Trump, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=18.88s)]
*  just like in the Hillary Clinton case. You know, explain to me why this really is a moment of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=24.88s)]
*  choosing for Merrick Garland, and I don't think he's capable of making the right choice because [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  I think he's weaponized that department. Well, the choice is this. It can't possibly be that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden at one and the same time is not capable of standing trial and, Sean, can still be president [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=42.4s)]
*  of the United States. It's one or the other. And what the special counsel said is he willfully [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=48.4s)]
*  retain classified documents. He willfully disclose them. That's a crime. But the special [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=53.36s)]
*  counsel said, oh, but I can't charge him because, you know, he can't stand trial. Well, all right, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=59.12s)]
*  then he shouldn't be president. So Garland needs to either charge Biden, prosecute him, or go to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=63.36s)]
*  the cabinet under the 25th amendment and say, guys, he can't be president. We need to remove him. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=70.08s)]
*  That's the choice. It's one or the other. You can't have it both ways. Okay. Now looking at [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=74.88s)]
*  that report and just what you see with your own eyes, and we have played so many of these moments [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=80.8s)]
*  on this show, probably more than any other show, and we probably were way ahead of the curve [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=87.52s)]
*  more than other people. And I took a lot of heat in the beginning for pointing out the obvious. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  We showed on this program on Friday, Joe Biden in 2020 versus Joe Biden today. And 2020, he looks [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=96.96s)]
*  lucid compared to where he is today. And it was bad in 2020. So clearly things have gotten, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=105.84s)]
*  you know, dramatically worse for him on this issue. And yet, I don't know, the media and the people [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=111.92s)]
*  around him seem to just want to enable him and prop him up, even though I don't think, I frankly [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  think they're hurting him in ways that we can't even begin to know. Well, and the special counsel's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=124.64s)]
*  report confirms all of that, Sean. I mean, what it says is the guy can't remember when he was vice [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=130.56s)]
*  president. Think about that. Eight years as vice president, he can't remember it. He can't remember [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=134.8s)]
*  when his own son died. He can't remember key questions about the Afghanistan debate when he [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=140.16000000000003s)]
*  was VP. He clearly is not in charge of his mental faculty, so much so they can't charge him with a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=144.56s)]
*  crime, which means he cannot be president of the United States any longer. I mean, it's just that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=150.4s)]
*  simple. And Sean, everybody can see it, to your point. The American people know. You could see it [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  in that press conference. He doesn't know where Mexico is. He doesn't know who the president of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=159.12s)]
*  Mexico is. He doesn't know what's going on in Gaza. He has no idea. The guy is not fit to be [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=163.36s)]
*  president. He should be removed, and if the Democrats had some integrity, they would do it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  Okay, that's, I'm not sure that's ever going to happen. However, you do have one problem. You [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  can't indict a sitting president. That part we know. So that would be post his presidency, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=180.0s)]
*  but that would mean he'd have to lose in November for that to happen. Is Joe trying to stay in for [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  his very survival or what can the rationale be? How is it so transparent to so many Americans, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=191.92s)]
*  everybody watching this show? I would tell you 98% of them see what I see and see what you see. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=199.04s)]
*  But yet here he is, as of today, he's their nominee and they're circling the wagons. Republicans [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=205.27999999999997s)]
*  create circular firing squads, but they're circling the wagons in a pretty strong way. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  How do you interpret that? Well, I just interpret it that, you know what, the presidency and public [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=216.72s)]
*  office in general has been pretty lucrative for the Biden. Sean, I mean, let's be honest about it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=221.6s)]
*  The Bidens have made money like nobody's business off of Joe being a senator and they being vice [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=226.0s)]
*  president and now being president. I mean, you talk about selling access to foreign corporations [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  and foreign governments. That was, that's what his son has been out there doing. Apparently his [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=236.32s)]
*  brother who knows who else. So they have a financial interest. I mean, of course they want [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=239.68s)]
*  the guy to be president. They're making gobs of money on it. But the truth is it's bad for the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  country. The truth is the guy's a criminal. That's what the special counsel report said. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=247.28s)]
*  So either charge him like a criminal or else force him to resign, go to the cabinet, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=251.44s)]
*  invoke the 25th amendment, say he isn't capable. We can all see it. And it's time for some [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=256.0s)]
*  Democrats to have some integrity and actually do it. What do you make of the FBI, the FCC, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=261.04s)]
*  all warning the tick tock, you know, is owned by China and it's likely a spying device. And, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=267.12s)]
*  you know, they have all these location biometric identifiers, China's authoritarian government, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=275.44s)]
*  Biden in 22 himself, he banned the use of tick tock by federal, by the federal government's nearly [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=281.2s)]
*  4 million employees on devices owned by the agencies. Why is he then using it? Can you [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=288.08s)]
*  explain that? No, I think the only explanation is he's so desperate, Sean. And also let's not [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=293.84s)]
*  forget a lot of this is actually about Israel. He's got a huge problem with his radical left base. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=298.96s)]
*  The radical left are pro Hamas. Let's be honest. They tick tock is a pro Hamas geyser of propaganda. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=304.48s)]
*  Now Biden wants to be on it. He wants to get back in the good graces of the anti Israel hater crowd [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=311.6s)]
*  who apparently needs to vote for him. So he's rushing to tick tock and he's rushing to try to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  reach out to anybody, anybody who will vote for him. And the truth is, you're right, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=321.6s)]
*  this government, Congress banned tick tock on all federal devices for all federal employees. I know [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  because I wrote the law and he signed it into law and here he is. Oh, no, forget it. Forget it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=331.76s)]
*  I'm getting on tick tock. I need the votes. I need to grovel. And this is really what he's doing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=336.48s)]
*  It's all about groveling desperation to get reelected. It's pathetic. Let me ask you this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=340.8s)]
*  Do you think that Joe Biden makes it until November? That's 266 days from today. Do you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=346.0s)]
*  think he makes it? And if you don't think so, who would be likely to replace him? I don't know how [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=352.08s)]
*  he makes it, Sean. I mean, to be honest, I just I look at that press conference that he did a couple [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=357.76s)]
*  days ago. I look at the special counsel's report. The American people know he's not capable. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=361.84s)]
*  Everybody can see it. The special counsel confirms it. I just think that there's going to be a move [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=366.56s)]
*  to replace him at the convention. Who's it going to be? I have no earthly idea, but I just I have [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  a hard it won't be common, although I don't think he makes it. Well, it's interesting. Gavin Newsom [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  in interviews I've had with him has said, no, he thinks that Kamala is up next, not him. He's been [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=380.24s)]
*  very clear about it multiple times. Who else is there? I kind of I don't think Michelle Obama [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=385.6s)]
*  wants anything to do with politics. I might be wrong. We'll see. But I don't know. It's going to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  be interesting to watch. I'll tell you that. Anyway, Josh Hawley, thank you, Senator. Appreciate it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWtx1K7g3Yc&t=398.96000000000004s)]
