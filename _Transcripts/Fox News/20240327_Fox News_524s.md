# ‘Squatters rights’ hit roadblock in Florida thanks to new bill
**Fox News:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q)
*  All right, so the issue of squatting now has been on the rise all across the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=0.0s)]
*  That's where people take over vacant homes, or they rent a property and never leave. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=4.84s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=10.36s)]
*  You own a property, you can't get rid of somebody that's in your house. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=11.36s)]
*  Oftentimes, it could take the property owners months or even years to get the squatters [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=14.16s)]
*  thrown out. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=18.92s)]
*  Well, now the state of Florida is taking action. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=19.92s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis just signed legislation that gives police the right to remove squatters [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=22.52s)]
*  as soon as they are found and makes it a felony to do more than $1,000 worth of damage to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=28.28s)]
*  a home while squatting. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=34.84s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=36.42s)]
*  Well, today in the state of Florida, we say very simply, what passes muster in New York [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=37.42s)]
*  and California is not passing muster here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=44.64s)]
*  You are not going to be able to commandeer somebody's private property and expect to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=48.56s)]
*  get away with it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=54.24s)]
*  We are in the state of Florida ending the squatter scam once and for all. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=55.28s)]
*  And it is a scam. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  I know somebody in New York, four and a half years, a squatter stayed in somebody else's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  house. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=66.72s)]
*  Now, the governor of Florida also recently signed a bill banning any children in the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=67.72s)]
*  state under the age of 14 from having a social media account. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=72.12s)]
*  After years of research has now revealed the serious dangers that these online platforms [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=76.44s)]
*  are posing to our kids. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=82.08s)]
*  Anyway, joining us now, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=84.16s)]
*  Governor, great to have you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=86.68s)]
*  I doubt when you got into politics that you ever imagined a day we'd be hearing story [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=89.28s)]
*  after story after story of people just commandeering other people's homes and then the courts protecting [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=96.04s)]
*  them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=104.68s)]
*  I know a case in New York, it went on four and a half years before they were finally [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=105.68s)]
*  legally allowed to take back their home. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=111.92s)]
*  Is this America? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=116.72s)]
*  This doesn't sound like the America I know. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=117.72s)]
*  What? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=120.72s)]
*  No, Sean. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=121.72s)]
*  And I mean, you know, you think about things like, you know, this idea of squatting when [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=122.72s)]
*  Americans were settling like the old west, you'd go, you didn't know who owned it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=126.92s)]
*  There weren't records. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=131.8s)]
*  So if people started a community there, then someone came six or seven years later and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=132.8s)]
*  claimed it was theirs. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=136.82s)]
*  Well, that was different. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=138.08s)]
*  It's an adverse possession. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=139.4s)]
*  It was never intended that you could just go into some subdivision and break into a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  house and start living there. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=146.32s)]
*  And then all of a sudden have all these rights vested in New York. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=148.56s)]
*  There was a case and it was reported where the homeowner went when someone had taken [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  over her house and the police did not evict the squatters. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  The police ended up arresting the homeowner. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=162.61999999999998s)]
*  What kind of a country is is that? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  So many issues. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=169.8s)]
*  What New York does, what California does, Florida will do the opposite. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  And so the squatter scam ends today with our legislation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=176.3s)]
*  And it's important because, Sean, you know, now being a Florida resident, we've got people [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=180.18s)]
*  that will be here for seven months of the year and then they'll go to Michigan or New [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  York or even Canada. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  So what you come back after the summer and someone's in your house and then they just [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=189.94000000000003s)]
*  get to stay there for six months. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  Now in Florida, you call up, you fill out a form, sheriff comes and the sheriff kicks [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=196.14s)]
*  them out of your property. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=202.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=203.66s)]
*  And by the way, and I've owned property in Florida for over 20 years. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=204.66s)]
*  Now I am a domiciled resident, permanent resident of Florida. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=209.17999999999998s)]
*  I have my Florida license to prove it if you want to see it and every other legal thing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=214.06s)]
*  that I had to do. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  But it's even worse than that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=220.38s)]
*  People can start out. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=223.04s)]
*  Maybe they'll pay the first month's rent, then they'll never pay again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=224.04s)]
*  And if you try to kick them out, you're right. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=228.12s)]
*  The home that you were describing was a case that was over a million dollars, that property, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=230.0s)]
*  and they arrested the homeowner. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=235.32s)]
*  And I'm, I'm thinking to myself, what country is this that they arrest the homeowner and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=238.04s)]
*  the squatter gets to stay in that person's house? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=243.92s)]
*  You can't make that up. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=247.16s)]
*  Moanne, it's like the private property rights, that's the bedrock of a free society and a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  constitutional republic. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  And what I think the left is doing, what some of these activists are doing, heck, even the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=257.7s)]
*  illegal aliens are going on social media and talking about squatting and urging other foreign [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=261.98s)]
*  nationals to come to this country illegally and commandeer property. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, if we don't have private property rights, we will not have a free society. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  So it is the bedrock. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=276.86s)]
*  Florida stands by that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=278.4s)]
*  We're proud to do it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=279.85999999999996s)]
*  And you know, Sean, it's like yet another reason why people are going to choose to flee [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=281.2s)]
*  from the New Yorks and the Californian end up coming down here to the Sunshine State. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=285.76s)]
*  Let me tell you, you have baby boomers that have yet to retire, people that have just [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=291.08s)]
*  gotten fed up with the crime, the high taxes, the way of life. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  They're going to be leaving in droves for the next two decades. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  I don't think this migration is ending anytime soon. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=303.88s)]
*  Let me ask you about social media and kids and 14 year olds. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=307.32s)]
*  And because there is a lot of danger, there are predators out there that are targeting [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=311.84s)]
*  our children online. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  You are very successful with this legislation. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=318.84s)]
*  I think it's been misconstrued by some in the media. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=321.28s)]
*  Not a big shock to you, but your reaction. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=324.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=327.2s)]
*  So basically, look, I'm a dad, Sean. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  I've got a first grader, a kindergartner, a preschooler. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=330.55999999999995s)]
*  My wife and I are thinking as they get older, what is this landscape going to even look like? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=334.04s)]
*  And the reality is it's hard for parents to keep up with everything that's out there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=338.64s)]
*  And so what our legislation says is for 14 and 15 year olds, social media companies cannot [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=343.0s)]
*  issue them their own social media account unless the parent consents. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=348.72s)]
*  So then this way, the parent can kind of know the dangers and then make that decision. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=352.6s)]
*  Thirteen and under social media companies cannot issue an account. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=356.56s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=361.12s)]
*  Under 13 is already prohibited under federal law. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=362.2s)]
*  It's just not enforced. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  So you do have eight year olds and 10 year olds who have these. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  What we've said is we're not really regulating the use. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=371.4s)]
*  I mean, if a 12 year old has something, it's not really about that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=374.2s)]
*  It's about holding the social media companies accountable. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=377.76s)]
*  If a parent wants to have a social media account and let their 11 year old use it, they are [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  free to do it under there. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  So I think it strikes the right balance to try to help parents navigate this really perilous [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  landscape. And you're right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=392.76s)]
*  The predators, you used to have to worry about the predator if the kids out in the neighborhood [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  and someone would come by in like a van. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=399.36s)]
*  Now the predator can come right into your house. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=401.56s)]
*  The kid can be there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=404.08s)]
*  Your kid can be just as safe as can be. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=405.2s)]
*  And then through that Internet and through those social media apps. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=408.24s)]
*  So I think we struck a good balance here. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=411.24s)]
*  And here's the thing, Sean, we're not talking about the content. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  We're talking about apps and social media networks that have addictive qualities. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=416.8s)]
*  So if they don't have the addictive qualities, then the bill doesn't even apply in that situation. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=422.04s)]
*  You know, I know a group of parents that actually have all come to an agreement, no cell phones [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=427.12s)]
*  for their kids until eighth grade. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=433.0s)]
*  I actually thought it was a great decision. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=436.0s)]
*  And many of the parents, what they have decided to do, I haven't had a landline in years. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=437.6s)]
*  I don't know about you, Governor, but I don't even know what one looks like anymore. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=442.6s)]
*  And they just decided if they do, if they allow any phone use, it's going to be a landline [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=446.56s)]
*  in their house that they can hear the conversation. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=452.84s)]
*  Pretty creative idea. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=457.6s)]
*  It's interesting, Sean. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=458.6s)]
*  So last year we did a bill that I signed that said school districts could say no cell phones [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=460.8s)]
*  during class time. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=467.92s)]
*  There was a huge uproar about that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=469.28s)]
*  People were saying that somehow this was, you know, too restrictive. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=471.0s)]
*  And yet what's happened this school year, the kids are learning better. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  Everyone's happier because the attention is on what's happening in the classroom. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=478.04s)]
*  I'd also say just as a parent, my wife and I have talked about this. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=481.92s)]
*  Our kids are too young to have any phones. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  We've decided that when they do get a phone, probably not going to be a smartphone. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=488.0s)]
*  It's going to be one of those old flip phones that we used to have where they can make a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=492.04s)]
*  call if they need anything from us. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=495.56s)]
*  But we don't have to worry about all the hundreds of different apps. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=497.72s)]
*  And here's the thing, Sean, too. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=500.32s)]
*  Apart from all the really significant harms with the predators, it's not healthy to have [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=501.8s)]
*  kids buried in their phones eight hours a day. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=507.32s)]
*  Thanks for being with us, Governor Rondas-Santos. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVjqxLi58Q&t=510.32s)]
