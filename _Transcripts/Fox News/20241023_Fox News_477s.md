# Tomi Lahren: Kamala Harris' campaign should be sued for 'malpractice'
**Fox News:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg)
*  We still don't have an answer to a pretty important question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=0.0s)]
*  Why is Kamala Harris even the nominee and not the guy that actually won the Democratic [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  primary by millions of votes? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=8.44s)]
*  Is that a threat to democracy? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=10.48s)]
*  Tonight during an interview, Kamala still could not answer that question. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=12.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=16.32s)]
*  Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=17.32s)]
*  moments with President Biden as you were with him again and again, repeatedly, in that time? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=20.7s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=25.48s)]
*  Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced and capable in every way that anyone would [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=27.2s)]
*  want if they were president. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=41.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=42.2s)]
*  You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=43.2s)]
*  him? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=45.84s)]
*  It was a bad debate. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=46.84s)]
*  People have bad debates. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=48.04s)]
*  He is absolutely... [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=50.44s)]
*  That's the reason why you're here and he's not running for the top of the ticket. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=52.16s)]
*  Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=56.63999999999999s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=59.4s)]
*  I am running for president of the United States. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=62.4s)]
*  Joe Biden is not. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  Here now with reaction, Harris poll chairman Mark Penn is with us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=67.2s)]
*  Former senior advisor to President Trump, Stephen Miller, the host of Outkick. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=70.0s)]
*  Tommy Lahren is fearless. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  The ever so fearless Tommy Lahren. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  Good to see you all. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=78.0s)]
*  Tommy, start with you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=79.0s)]
*  All right, your reaction to all of this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=80.0s)]
*  This to me is their closing argument. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=82.08s)]
*  They sound desperate. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=84.84s)]
*  They're acting desperate and they can't answer the question where they have been successful, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=86.6s)]
*  how they improved the country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=91.96s)]
*  That to me is a problem. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  And Kamala is also visibly agitated and angry and hostile when she's asked or she's pressed [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=97.6s)]
*  even the slightest bit by her friends in the mainstream media. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=103.64s)]
*  I will also say this, not only are they wreaking of desperation, when you hear and the polls [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  are telling you that you're hemorrhaging black men and you're hemorrhaging Hispanic support, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  you decide or your campaign decides the best way to navigate that is to put Liz Cheney [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=117.98s)]
*  out on the campaign trail as if that is going to somehow win you back. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  Black and Hispanic support. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=128.18s)]
*  I mean, her campaign team, they should be sued for malpractice at this point. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  I would assume that she had some pretty excellent folks on that team, but perhaps I was wrong. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  But Sean, listen, the polls are exciting if you're a Trump supporter or Republican. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=138.66000000000003s)]
*  You and I are always cautiously optimistic. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=143.06s)]
*  We tread very lightly in getting overly excited because the red wave in 2022 was just a pink [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=145.38000000000002s)]
*  splash. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=151.46s)]
*  But I'll tell you this, this is why I'm encouraged, because in 2020 and in the 2022 [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=152.46s)]
*  midterms, the Democrats had two luxuries that they do not enjoy now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=156.9s)]
*  They always had bad candidates. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=160.86s)]
*  In 2020, certainly a bad candidate, but they had the luxury of mastering the logistics [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=162.3s)]
*  of elections. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=167.22000000000003s)]
*  They could get out the vote. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  They had the early voting down, the mail-in voting, the ballot harvesting where it was [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  legal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=173.94s)]
*  So they had that luxury. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=174.94s)]
*  But now Republicans are closing that gap because Republicans are getting in the game. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=175.94s)]
*  We love to see it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  And the second luxury that they don't have is that people don't have the luxury themselves [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=181.5s)]
*  right now of just simply voting on their hatred for Donald Trump. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=185.77999999999997s)]
*  So they keep trying to peddle this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's a dictator. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=191.17999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump is all three dictators in one. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=192.66s)]
*  Well, if the country was going well under the current administration, that might work. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=194.74s)]
*  But that is old. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=198.54000000000002s)]
*  It's tired. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=199.54000000000002s)]
*  As Kamala says, it's time to turn the page on that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  We don't have the luxury to simply vote against Donald Trump coming up in a couple of weeks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=202.74s)]
*  Mark, as you look at the polls, and I put a little stock in the betting markets. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=207.26000000000002s)]
*  I know there's some controversy on that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=212.02s)]
*  And I think Mark Halperin, like you, is a smart guy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  I think he leans more left, obviously. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=217.3s)]
*  If early voting trends continue, he says this election could be over before election day. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=220.3s)]
*  And you've been very outspoken that you think things are swinging Donald Trump's way. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=226.5s)]
*  Tell us where you see it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, look, I think Donald Trump has an edge. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=231.9s)]
*  I would not count Kamala Harris out at this point. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=236.18s)]
*  But I think he's got an edge because he's winning on all the major issues. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  As you showed with Barack Obama's comments. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=245.8s)]
*  And she's winning on the economy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=249.44s)]
*  She's winning on immigration. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  She's winning on crime. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=252.28s)]
*  And I'm winning by large margins on—he's winning on large margins of who could do a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=253.88000000000002s)]
*  better job to end the Ukraine and Israel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=259.6s)]
*  And that means foreign affairs and domestic policy are in his camp. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=262.68s)]
*  I think he's had some very strong issues in swing states, doing the autoworkers in Michigan, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=267.04s)]
*  fracking in Pennsylvania, and no tax on tips in Nevada. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=274.16s)]
*  I think it's been a clever campaign in all those respects. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=279.08s)]
*  And so I think he's got the edge. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=282.48s)]
*  And most importantly, I think Republicans were losing about two points by counting on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=284.96s)]
*  their vote to show up on election day because only about 90 percent of voters who plan to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=289.92s)]
*  vote on election day wind up there. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=294.92s)]
*  And the fact they're equalizing, that is probably worth one to two points, particularly [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=297.24s)]
*  in these swing states. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=302.36s)]
*  That's an important analysis. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=303.88s)]
*  Seventy-nine percent, I'll add to that, Steve and Miller, think that the country is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=306.16s)]
*  now headed in the wrong direction, on top of Donald Trump being right on the issues [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=310.56s)]
*  and in line with the American people. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=315.32s)]
*  And a peace and prosperity drive elections, that would give him the advantage, in my view. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=317.0s)]
*  But to me, the closing argument of calling Donald Trump names just proves my point. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=321.8s)]
*  They don't have a record of success to run on. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=328.92s)]
*  Your thoughts. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=331.68s)]
*  It's the same pathetic, desperate, hoaxing, vile defamation and slander that we've seen. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=334.8s)]
*  But the American people are not buying it, and that is reflected in poll after poll after [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=341.12s)]
*  poll. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=346.04s)]
*  And as Mark said, it's because President Trump is winning on the issues, his massive edge [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=347.04s)]
*  on tackling inflation and making the economy work for American workers, his massive edge [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=352.38s)]
*  on foreign policy, his colossal edge on the border invasion and the immigration disaster, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=357.7s)]
*  issue after issue. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=363.7s)]
*  And as you mentioned, eight in 10 Americans think that the Biden-Harris administration [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=364.7s)]
*  has put America on the wrong track. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=369.09999999999997s)]
*  Then look at the quality of the campaign, Sean. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=371.26s)]
*  Have we ever seen such a series of blunders as we've seen from Kamala in recent days and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  weeks saying that people who believe in Jesus are not welcome at her rally, skipping the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=379.02s)]
*  Then sending in an anti-Catholic video mocking and denigrating Catholics, then doing a national [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=384.82s)]
*  TV interview, the clip you just played, where she's swearing to the American people that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=390.86s)]
*  Joe Biden's brain is in perfect top functioning form, and then having that town hall where [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=395.62s)]
*  somebody tried to ask a question and they said, no, we don't let anyone ask questions [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=401.52s)]
*  that haven't been preselected here. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=404.46s)]
*  I mean, one time after another, her campaign has had catastrophic, huge, embarrassing humiliations. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=406.26s)]
*  And what about President Trump? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=413.74s)]
*  Masterstroke after masterstroke from the Al Smith dinner to the shift at McDonald's to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=415.62s)]
*  the no tax on tips, again, the market talked about that's winning over service workers [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=421.74s)]
*  to getting the endorsement of the rank and file Teamster, something no Republican has [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=426.24s)]
*  ever done before. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhAACQQ5Hhg&t=430.22s)]
