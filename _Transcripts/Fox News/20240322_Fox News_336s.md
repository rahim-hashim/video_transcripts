# Gold Star father: 'I was scared' until SOTU charges were dropped
**Fox News:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E)
*  All right, earlier this month during Biden's State of the Union, Gold Star Father Steve [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=0.0s)]
*  Nkoui, whose son was killed during Biden's disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal at Karzai [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=4.96s)]
*  International Airport, was inexplicably arrested after briefly interrupting Biden's State of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=10.68s)]
*  the Union with a message, a simple one, but a profound one. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=17.04s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=20.92s)]
*  Year before I took office, murder rates went up 30 percent. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=22.76s)]
*  Thirty percent they went up. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  The biggest increase in history. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  It was then, through my American Rescue Plan. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=34.92s)]
*  Now, Mr. Nkoui was arrested, charged with misdemeanor, disturbance of a public peace, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  a charge that carries up to 90 days in jail. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=47.44s)]
*  Thankfully, finally, this week, it should have happened immediately. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=50.56s)]
*  The authorities in D.C. have come to their senses, and the D.C. attorney general finally [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=54.56s)]
*  dropped the charges. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=59.56s)]
*  Steve Nkoui is back with us for an exclusive reaction on this, and Congressman Darrell [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  Issa, who's been very helpful in this as well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=66.16s)]
*  Mr. Nkoui, I'm sorry it took so long. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=68.44s)]
*  As I said before, it should have happened immediately, knowing what you've gone through. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=71.12s)]
*  I'm sure you're relieved, to say the least. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=78.2s)]
*  Yeah, thank you, Sean, for having us. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=80.6s)]
*  I am really relieved. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  It was a lot of pressure. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=86.24s)]
*  I was scared, but I was ready to do whatever I had to do, you know, for my actions. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=87.24s)]
*  But I want to thank, you know, Congressman Issa, who, from that night, you know, said, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=96.12s)]
*  I'm not going to leave you alone, you know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=102.92s)]
*  We're going to take care of you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=105.52s)]
*  And he did it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=108.04s)]
*  And so did Congressman Walz and my friend Brian Mast and Mills. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=109.36s)]
*  And I appreciate that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=113.68s)]
*  And I'm in awe of them because of that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=115.04s)]
*  I was scared, and they never left me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=119.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm glad for you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=122.04s)]
*  And Congressman Issa, I've known you for a long time, and I know when you commit to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=125.16s)]
*  something you do, why was this even a thought? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=129.16s)]
*  I mean, once they realized that he was only talking about Abbey's Gate and his son, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=134.04s)]
*  who never should have lost his life because of Biden's, you know, bungled withdrawal, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=139.44s)]
*  he has every right to say his son's name and remind the president, I'm sorry, but [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=145.44s)]
*  he never should have gotten charged in the first place. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=152.0s)]
*  Well, you're exactly right, Sean. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=154.52s)]
*  In the past, there have been interruptions that, quite frankly, were more deliberate [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=156.76s)]
*  and with less justification, and they were not charged. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=160.76s)]
*  And that's something that Congressman Ken Calvert and Mike Walz and Brian Mast and all [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=164.48s)]
*  of us kept making the point of finally writing official letters and pushing hard with the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  sergeant at arms. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=176.16s)]
*  And with the help of the sergeant at arms, we were able to convince the D.C. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=177.44s)]
*  attorney general that this was inappropriate and that ultimately the House was not interrupted [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  in any significant or unusual way. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=189.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=191.2s)]
*  Look, Mr. Nakui, let me ask you this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=192.2s)]
*  I understand and I saw testimony, people like the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=195.16s)]
*  Milley, that you have had contact with him. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=201.32s)]
*  My understanding is the military did not support the operation being done this way, that they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=205.32s)]
*  had very different plans for a peaceful withdrawal that would have gotten not only every American [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=210.48s)]
*  out, but all of the allies that helped us the many years our troops were there and would [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  have gotten our military equipment out instead of leaving billions of dollars of equipment [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=223.0s)]
*  in the hands of the Taliban. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=227.28s)]
*  How did that meeting go with General Milley? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=229.04s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, so earlier this week we did have an opportunity. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  Some of the Abbey Gate families, as well as myself, which represents a larger coalition [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=236.44s)]
*  of the families, had an opportunity to sit down with him in the roundtable. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=241.38s)]
*  I found him to be empathetic and understanding to our cause surrounding our children's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=246.12s)]
*  death and I respected the fact that he was able to look us in the eyes as we were able [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  to tell him some pretty disheartening information about our family. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=257.48s)]
*  He was committed to helping us get the facts and the answers that we need. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=263.32s)]
*  But Sean, let me make sure that everyone understands. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=270.58000000000004s)]
*  We're going to make sure that he is held accountable to what he's promised us and that his promises [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=274.82s)]
*  are upheld and that we can get the answers that we need to get from this administration [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=280.84s)]
*  concerning this disastrous withdrawal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=289.44s)]
*  Mr. Nakui, I know words don't really offer a lot of comfort for people like you or people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=290.44s)]
*  like Lake and Riley's family when something like that happens, but your son was a hero. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=297.32s)]
*  This never should have happened. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=304.24s)]
*  I don't believe if Donald Trump was president he would have allowed the Taliban to march [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=305.24s)]
*  all the way up to Karzai Airport and then have a hasty withdrawal like that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=309.88000000000005s)]
*  But our prayers are with you and your family and Congressman Issa, thank you for all you [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  did here and all your fellow congressmen that got involved. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  We appreciate it a lot. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3SvBeyp3E&t=323.56s)]
