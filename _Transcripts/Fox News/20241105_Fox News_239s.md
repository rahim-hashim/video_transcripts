# Vivek Ramaswamy: I think Trump wins decisively
**Fox News:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY)
*  It isâ€”it's amazing what this has now come down to. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=0.0s)]
*  The good news for Donald Trump and maybe the bad news for Kamala Harris, early voting, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=4.48s)]
*  the numbers that she, on paper, needed to hit in early voting, she had not come near [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=9.48s)]
*  in any of the swing states. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  However, that doesn't mean that her voters can't come out tomorrow. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=15.72s)]
*  But then I asked myself, well, if you're really enthusiastic about Kamala, why wouldn't [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=19.44s)]
*  you have come out early? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=24.0s)]
*  Why would they be down in early voting? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=27.48s)]
*  Look, I try to stay as objective as possible with myself, Sean. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=29.48s)]
*  I think there's two possibilities here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=33.16s)]
*  One is we all have our heads stuck in our own algorithmic echo chambers, or Donald Trump [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=35.0s)]
*  is going to win this decisively. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=39.84s)]
*  And I truly think it's going to be the latter. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=41.16s)]
*  I've gone on the ground in Pennsylvania, across the country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=42.64s)]
*  I see an energy, especially from demographic groups that have historically gone Democrat, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=46.16s)]
*  including young people, including Gen Z, coming our way. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=50.88s)]
*  I love those early vote numbers. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=54.0s)]
*  Again, in principle, there's two possibilities. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=55.68s)]
*  One is we're doing great, and that's a predictor of how we're going to do in the election. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=58.08s)]
*  The other is because of the emphasis for Republicans on voting early this year, people who would [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  have voted on election day are now voting early instead, in which case that doesn't [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=65.16s)]
*  bode as well for us. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=69.24s)]
*  So we've got to stay objective heading into tomorrow. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=70.24s)]
*  We can't celebrate yet. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=72.4s)]
*  But my sixth sense, my gut, from traveling this country, Pennsylvania, twice over the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=73.72s)]
*  course of just the last week and last few days, suggests to me there's something real [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=78.12s)]
*  going on here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=82.1s)]
*  This could be a decisive, unifying victory, where by tomorrow night, if not late, into [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=83.44s)]
*  the next day, Wednesday morning or Wednesday evening, we know exactly who's going to be [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  the next president. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=92.52s)]
*  That's Donald Trump. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=93.6s)]
*  And uniting this country will then be the next step. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=94.72s)]
*  One of the things that was interesting, if you look at what we call low-propensity, mid-propensity [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=98.4s)]
*  voters, they were showing up in the early voting and being targeted by the Republican [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=102.6s)]
*  Party. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=108.44s)]
*  They've been a number of challenges on various issues that have come up. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=110.44s)]
*  They've won most of them in the courts, which is good. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=115.0s)]
*  And however, it really does come down to the ground game at this point, or what we call [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=118.32s)]
*  the ground game. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=122.96s)]
*  You've been working very closely and have been around the Trump campaign the entire [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=124.88s)]
*  time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=128.32s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=129.32s)]
*  How organized are they? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=130.32s)]
*  I feel good, Sean. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=133.56s)]
*  And I think there were a lot of lessons from 2020. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=134.6s)]
*  I think there were a lot of lessons even that led up to some of the leadership shuffles [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=137.8s)]
*  in the Republican Party, which I think have been for the better in improving that level [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=140.24s)]
*  of organization. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=143.84s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think what's driving this groundswell isn't just the organization. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=144.84s)]
*  That's important. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  But what's driving the groundswell is this idea that we're rejecting an ideology of censorship, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  of unnecessary foreign conflict, an ideology of shrinking the economy as a way of apologizing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=155.0s)]
*  for our way of life, an ideology that's opened our own southern borders and apologizes for [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=160.56s)]
*  who we are as Americans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  There are people who are former Democrats, independents, libertarians, young and old, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=167.8s)]
*  a multi-ethnic working class coalition of voters that have really come together under [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=171.8s)]
*  a broad tent that I give Donald Trump immense credit for building. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=176.32s)]
*  That's what a leader actually has to do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=179.8s)]
*  He has to unite different coalitions. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  I think he's done that beautifully. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=183.8s)]
*  And one of the things I'm looking forward to, if we do win this decisively, as I expect [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=185.32s)]
*  and hope, Sean, one of the things I look forward to is now that new coalition becoming the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=189.56s)]
*  new Republican Party. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  Reagan changed the composition of the Republican Party in a major way. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=195.44s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump has shuffled the decks for the better in an even more major [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  way this time around. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=202.04s)]
*  And the way I'm looking at this is tomorrow, November 5th. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  We've been working towards it for a long time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=206.44s)]
*  That's not our destination. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  That is the start line for reviving this country. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=210.44s)]
*  I know Donald Trump sees it the same way as well. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  He's sprinting through the finish, running through the tape and heading into tomorrow. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  I truly feel optimistic and I think our best days are ahead of us. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=219.76s)]
*  God willing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=224.56s)]
*  Very, very well said. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcO5JNynoGY&t=225.56s)]
