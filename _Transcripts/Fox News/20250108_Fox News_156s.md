# Prisoners at Guantanamo are the ‘worst of the the worst’: Sen. Tom Cotton
**Fox News:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo)
*  Here with more Arkansas governor, Tom Cotton. Senator, not only did we release these 11 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=0.0s)]
*  people, got nothing in return for it. One of the detainees apparently was Osama Bin [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=6.88s)]
*  Laden's bodyguard. Is that true? Sean, it is true. Actually, three of them [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=12.0s)]
*  were Osama Bin Laden bodyguards. So it's hard for them to argue that these were just innocent [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=18.12s)]
*  goat herders rounded up by the American military 24 years ago. People left in Guantanamo are [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=22.92s)]
*  the worst of the worst, the hardest cases. And Joe Biden, as you said, released them for nothing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=28.68s)]
*  They're going to the exact same place in the exact same program where Obama released 30 [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=33.88s)]
*  Guantanamo detainees in his final two years. And what happened to them? 29 of them went back to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=39.24s)]
*  their home countries, Yemen and Afghanistan, with no accounting for their whereabouts. For all we [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=43.88s)]
*  know, they're backing the fight, threatening Americans. Yet another step for Joe Biden [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  to add the historic legacy of coddling America's enemies and endangering our people. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=53.24s)]
*  Can you explain, we lost 2,977 Americans that day, and I remember it like it was yesterday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  Can you explain the logic behind it? And if you're going to release them, maybe you get [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=67.8s)]
*  something in exchange. Maybe there are Americans you could have gotten freed in the process. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=73.8s)]
*  Why not get anything? No, Sean, I don't think it is explicable. It's just consistent with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=78.52s)]
*  the Democratic mindset, though, going back to the early days after the 9-11 attacks. They've been [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=84.84s)]
*  criticizing Guantanamo Bay, trying to close it, trying to bring these hardened terrorists to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=91.56s)]
*  American soil to give them the full set of rights that any person present in the United States has. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=95.96s)]
*  And remember, a lot of the lawyers working in the Biden White House, the Department of Justice, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  these were the lawyers that were suing the federal government on behalf of hardened terrorists [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=107.0s)]
*  during the Bush administration and during the first Trump administration. And what do you think [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=112.04s)]
*  they're going to do in two weeks? They're going to go back to representing terrorists again, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=116.28s)]
*  suing the federal government, taking the side of those who have American blood on their hands. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=120.68s)]
*  Yeah. Well, remember Kamala ran and said, we must have the courage to never say [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=126.68s)]
*  radical Islamic terrorists. Well, I mean, if you can't speak the truth, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=133.56s)]
*  one of the reasons I think she lost. Senator, great to see you. Happy New Year. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fkeSPSfgo&t=139.32s)]
