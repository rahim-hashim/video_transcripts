# Kayleigh McEnany: Biden was ‘limited out of necessity by unelected handlers’
**Fox News:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A)
*  Welcome to this special edition of Hannity. I'm Kayleigh McEnany. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=0.0s)]
*  And for Sean, we start here with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=3.6s)]
*  President Trump leading the way on budget negotiations, endorsing a new, drastically [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=7.92s)]
*  slimmed-down bill to keep the government open. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=13.42s)]
*  But on Capitol Hill, that measure was just voted down. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=16.56s)]
*  And the clock is ticking as government funding runs dry at midnight tomorrow. That's about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=20.02s)]
*  26 hours from now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=23.92s)]
*  Now, this comes as we learn shocking new details about how the Biden White House cocooned and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=26.16s)]
*  protected a diminished commander-in-chief. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=32.92s)]
*  Now, the reporting comes from this exposé in The Wall Street Journal. They reported [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=35.56s)]
*  that, quote, there were limits over who Biden spoke with, limits on what they said to him, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  and limits around the sources of information he consumed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=46.84s)]
*  The president of the United States limited out of necessity by unelected handlers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=51.48s)]
*  Let that sink in. The report notes that, quote, senior advisors were often put into roles [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  that some administration officials and lawmakers thought that Biden himself should occupy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  So who has been running the country over the last four years? That's the question. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=69.32s)]
*  The president's diminished status was so bad that meetings with Democratic lawmakers, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=74.72s)]
*  powerful secretaries like Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Treasury Secretary Janet [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=80.76s)]
*  Yellen, quote, were infrequent or grew less frequent. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=86.64s)]
*  In fact, they canceled meetings altogether if Biden was out of it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=90.08s)]
*  And, quote, some legislative leaders had a hard time getting the president's ear at key [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=95.48s)]
*  moments, including ahead of the U.S.'s disastrous pullout from Afghanistan. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=100.68s)]
*  As you'll remember, we lost 13 heroic Americans at the Abbey Gate in the ruinous fall of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan and lawmakers couldn't get a hold of the president. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=112.56s)]
*  But perhaps the most disturbing detail of all of this is this. Listen closely. Quote, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=117.12s)]
*  a sign that the bruising presidential schedule needed to be adjusted for Biden's advanced [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=123.04s)]
*  had risen early on in just the first few months of Biden's term. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=128.8s)]
*  Administration officials noticed that the president became tired if meetings went long [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=134.8s)]
*  and would make some mistakes. So aides to the president knew in just the first few months [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=139.84s)]
*  of his term the incapacity of the leader of the free world. And they did nothing. What a scandal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=145.84s)]
*  In fact, listen to this. In the spring of 2021, so just after taking office, Biden was having [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=154.4s)]
*  an off day, so they scrapped a national security meeting. Now, one national security official [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=160.56s)]
*  involved with that canceled meeting noted to a White House aide, quote, he has good [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  days and bad days, and today was a bad day. So we are going to address this tomorrow. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=171.04s)]
*  Let's hope the matter could wait until then. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=177.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, President-elect Trump is actively engaged, and this is a month before inauguration [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  day. Trump is negotiating government funding deals. He's prodding allies like Canada and Mexico [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=184.24s)]
*  to fix their poorest borders. And he's mapping out an ambitious legislative agenda. But first, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Congress will need to pass a budget deal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_9Subtgr7A&t=208.8s)]
