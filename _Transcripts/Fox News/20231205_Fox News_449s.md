# Donald Trump: Biden ‘doesn’t know he’s alive’
**Fox News:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0)
*  And welcome back to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=0.0s)]
*  We are broadcasting live tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=2.2s)]
*  Beautiful Davenport, Iowa. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=3.72s)]
*  Thank you all for coming. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=4.72s)]
*  We continue now with former President Donald Trump as we now head into the Iowa caucus [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=5.72s)]
*  season. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=12.44s)]
*  A two-part question on Joe Biden. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=13.44s)]
*  One is about his cognitive decline and the second is about the Biden family syndicate, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  as I call it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Let's first play an RNC ad about Joe Biden. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=24.36s)]
*  What the nature, not when the political coverage, that look, some of the political players and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  some of the... [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=49.92s)]
*  Let me ask a rhetorical question. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=51.92s)]
*  No, anyway. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=55.92s)]
*  Now, there's all... [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=59.92s)]
*  I could play tape from almost every day. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  I think another horrible moment for him was that gaggle on Air Force One after he left [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=67.12s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  So my question is, what do you think about his cognitive state and number two, the issue [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  of Hunter Biden, Joe Biden lying to the country as a candidate and president. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=78.36s)]
*  I never had a discussion with Hunter or my brother or anybody for that matter on foreign [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=83.68s)]
*  business deals. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=88.0s)]
*  We know, according to Devin Archer, he was on phone calls. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  We know he was meeting with oligarchs like the former first lady of Moscow, a Cafe Milano. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=92.16s)]
*  Doesn't seem to get the attention in the media that anything involving you gets. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=97.92s)]
*  What is your reaction to both? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=102.48s)]
*  Well, you know, they've been after all of my numbers and facts and figures, and they [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=104.12s)]
*  found out that it was incredible. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=108.64s)]
*  Somebody said, you must be the most honest guy in the world because after all these years [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=111.08s)]
*  and they saw everything, my tax returns, they saw everything, went up to the ceiling and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  they saw it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=118.84s)]
*  He is number one from your standpoint, cognitively. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=120.28s)]
*  You like to use that word, cognitively. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  He's not good, but it's not for me to say. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=128.92s)]
*  I just saw a commercial by these lowlifes where they took me imitating him at a speech [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=129.92s)]
*  where we're all having a lot of fun. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=135.24s)]
*  It's not really fun because we shouldn't be joking about it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=136.88s)]
*  I actually told Sean, Sean, you shouldn't joke about it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=139.72s)]
*  It's serious. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=141.92s)]
*  We're dealing with nuclear. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=142.92s)]
*  We're dealing with other leaders. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=143.92s)]
*  By the way, that is a true story. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=144.92s)]
*  You actually called me and said, it's not funny because I was talking about it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=145.92s)]
*  That's not funny at all. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=151.0s)]
*  And I said, I thought about it and I said, you're right. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=152.0s)]
*  And I said, how come you never listen to my advice? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=154.96s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=158.28s)]
*  It's actually true, unfortunately. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=160.6s)]
*  But, you know, I saw you imitated him not finding his way off the stage. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=162.6s)]
*  It's not really that hard. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  You're looking around and I walk into a wall. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=167.16s)]
*  I said, let me see. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  And I do that a lot. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, I just sort of at some of our rallies and then I'll say, our real [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=170.68s)]
*  president is Barack Hussein Obama. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=176.76s)]
*  They'll say he doesn't know who the president is. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  He thinks it's Barack Hussein. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  No, I'm being sarcastic. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=182.56s)]
*  So they imitate it, but they're disgraceful. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=184.72000000000003s)]
*  I'll tell you what, we are dealing and you are dealing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  I got to know them all, the leaders of the world. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=190.72000000000003s)]
*  I got to know them all. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=193.08s)]
*  And they're at the top of their game. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=193.96s)]
*  Some are bad people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=196.52s)]
*  Some are decent people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=198.0s)]
*  They all have one thing in common. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=199.16000000000003s)]
*  They want what's good for their country, whether it's President Xi of China or [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=200.56s)]
*  Kim Jong-un of North Korea saved. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=204.36s)]
*  I you would have been if Hillary got in, you would have been in nuclear war. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=206.4s)]
*  That would have been a nuclear war. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  Any one of them, they're all including Macron of France. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=212.6s)]
*  I mean, you can go to any of them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=215.84s)]
*  Putin, they're at the top of their game. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=217.52s)]
*  We have somebody that was never at the top of his game. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=220.2s)]
*  Twenty five years ago, he wasn't one of the light bulbs. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=223.28s)]
*  He wasn't one of the bright ones. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=225.96s)]
*  And I tell I tell the story. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=228.36s)]
*  So Ted Kennedy, believe it or not, was a friend of mine because of Palm Beach. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=230.08s)]
*  They lived in Palm Beach, had what's called the Kennedy compound. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=233.4s)]
*  And I once I did him a big favor one time and somehow he liked me. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=236.8s)]
*  I liked him even though we were opposite in many ways, politically, certainly. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=240.04s)]
*  And I said to him, who's the smartest guy in the Senate? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=244.64s)]
*  And he gave me a name. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=248.12s)]
*  I don't want to tell you because I really don't like the guy at all. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=249.32s)]
*  Still around. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=251.96s)]
*  I said, who's the dumbest? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=253.4s)]
*  He said, probably Joe. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=254.6s)]
*  I said, who's Joe? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=256.8s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=257.68s)]
*  It's the first time I said, and that was it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=258.8s)]
*  And now I see when he's not in prime time for himself. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=262.88s)]
*  I mean, years later, he failed on being president when he was like normal. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=266.52s)]
*  Some something is going wrong and we can't afford it because we have a problem today. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=271.64s)]
*  Nuclear weapons is the single biggest problem the world has. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=277.56s)]
*  And we have people, you know, it used to be 10 years ago, even five years ago, even [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=281.32s)]
*  three years ago, nobody would have thought about nuclear. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=285.68s)]
*  You couldn't mention the word. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  Now it's being mentioned at every meeting. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=289.64s)]
*  Every time you talk, it's being mentioned. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=292.0s)]
*  The level of power of the nuclear weapons is incredible. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  Take Hiroshima or take Nagasaki and you look and that was many, many decades ago and multiply [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=299.52s)]
*  that times 500. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=306.76s)]
*  That's what a big bomb would be today, whether it's Israel or really major countries. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=308.52s)]
*  Nuclear weapons are the biggest problem we have. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=316.76s)]
*  And we have a man that can't put two sentences together. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=318.64s)]
*  We have a man that doesn't know he's alive and he's backed up by the media. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=321.28s)]
*  The biggest problem we have the media. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=325.44s)]
*  The media is fake. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=327.84s)]
*  I came up with the term a long time ago and they won't talk about it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=328.88s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=333.0s)]
*  If I did some of the things that he did, they'd reinstitute the death penalty. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=335.0s)]
*  OK, they don't want to talk about it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=340.88s)]
*  When he gets paid three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife, when [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=343.2s)]
*  I brought it up at a debate and Chris Wallace was moderating. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=347.36s)]
*  How's he doing, by the way? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=351.36s)]
*  Not too good. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=352.52s)]
*  Chris Wallace. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=353.88s)]
*  What happened to Chris Wallace? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=354.88s)]
*  And I said, why is he getting three and a half million dollars? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  I want to ask him that question. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  And Chris Wallace interceded because Joe didn't know he was alive. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=360.52s)]
*  And so Chris Wallace interceded and he said, and he said, you shouldn't be asking that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=363.8s)]
*  you and now it's a big subject. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=368.56s)]
*  And I talked about it literally three years ago. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=370.28s)]
*  But why does all this money come in from China? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=373.8s)]
*  We took in hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs from China. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=376.88000000000005s)]
*  We gave the farmers, by the way, twenty eight billion dollars. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=382.48s)]
*  That's why I say I'm going to win Iowa. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=385.56s)]
*  I had my people, my people say, please, sir, don't keep saying you're going to win Iowa. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=388.16s)]
*  You sound so really horrible. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=393.6s)]
*  Crass. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=396.0s)]
*  Somebody said crass. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=397.0s)]
*  I said, but it's true. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=398.0s)]
*  We're going to win Iowa. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=399.56s)]
*  I gave the farmers twenty eight billion dollars and I got it from China. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=400.68s)]
*  Who else could do that? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=404.66s)]
*  Who else would be able to do it? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=405.84s)]
*  Number one, who else would think about it? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=407.2s)]
*  I think about it because the farmers were hurt very badly by China for many years. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=409.28s)]
*  And I asked our secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, I said, Sonny, how much damage [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  has been done over the past seven years, eight years? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=418.67999999999995s)]
*  He came back twenty eight billion dollars. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=422.12s)]
*  I said, I'm getting it from China and I got it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=424.08s)]
*  And I told the farmers, go out and buy more land and go out and buy bigger tractors. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=426.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=431.0s)]
*  You remember that? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=432.0s)]
*  He said, I'm going to win Iowa because nobody else is going to be able to do that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkzNge9jV0&t=433.0s)]
