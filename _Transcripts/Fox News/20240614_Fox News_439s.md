# Speaker Johnson: This is a serious situation
**Fox News:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0)
*  We want to see borders, we want to see strong military, we want to see money not wasted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=0.0s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  We don't want to see Russian ships right off the coast of Florida, which is what they are [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=8.56s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=14.16s)]
*  That's unthinkable. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=15.16s)]
*  We want to see just success for our country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=16.16s)]
*  And we don't have success right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=19.68s)]
*  We have inflation that's killing everybody. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=21.66s)]
*  We have levels of inflation that nobody's seen for, they say 42 years, they say 53 years, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=24.76s)]
*  and they say 75 years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  I would say probably all of them are wrong. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  Probably we've never seen levels like this before. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  And we're going to end that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=37.92s)]
*  We're going to bring back our jobs. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=39.92s)]
*  We're going to bring back common sense to government. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=41.8s)]
*  We're going to have strong borders, and we're going to have people come into our country, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  but they're going to come in legally. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=48.56s)]
*  They're not going to pour in from prisons all over South America and all over the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=49.56s)]
*  And it's not just South America, by the way. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  It's all over the world. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  And we're not going to have them pour in from mental institutions, which is where they're [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  coming from. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=61.04s)]
*  Large numbers, and large numbers are terrorists. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  And we're not going to have this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=64.8s)]
*  So what's happening to our country is of great concern to the group of people standing alongside [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=67.46s)]
*  of me. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=73.92s)]
*  And I just wanted to say that we have great unity. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=74.92s)]
*  We have great common sense. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=77.96s)]
*  All right, joining us now, someone who was inside that closed-door meeting on Capitol [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=80.64s)]
*  Hill. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=85.24s)]
*  He's the speaker of the House. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=86.24s)]
*  Mike Johnson is with us. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=87.24s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, welcome back. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=88.24s)]
*  Great to have you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=89.92s)]
*  Can we just settle one thing once and for all here? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=90.92s)]
*  Did President Trump, has been attributed to him that he took a shot at Milwaukee? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=93.76s)]
*  Did he do that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=98.56s)]
*  No, I didn't hear it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=99.56s)]
*  And I was sitting right next to him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=101.68s)]
*  I introduced him this morning at breakfast, where he started the day. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=103.0s)]
*  He spoke for an hour without notes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=106.12s)]
*  Sean, he can stand up there and hold court as long as he wants, as you know. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=108.32s)]
*  President Trump is on his A game. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  And I'm telling you, in the room this morning, there was energy, enthusiasm, excitement. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=113.88s)]
*  We had colleagues in there, Sean, who were commenting after his visit with us this morning, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=118.8s)]
*  the House Republicans, that they haven't been this excited about the future of our [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=122.36s)]
*  country in 40 years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=127.24s)]
*  That's what one of my colleagues told me. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=128.88s)]
*  Look, there's a palpable energy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=130.6s)]
*  In his words, something he said this morning, he said, something's happening in America, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=133.1s)]
*  and we see it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=137.16s)]
*  There's a demographic shift going on in all these different segments of the population. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  We're headed for a great November. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=142.4s)]
*  We have to run like we're 10 points behind. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=143.56s)]
*  But I'm convinced Donald J. Trump is going to get a second term as president. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=145.2s)]
*  We're going to retake the Republican majority in the Senate, and we're going to grow the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=149.04s)]
*  House majority in the House. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=152.72s)]
*  And that's going to be a good day for America. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  If you go issue by issue, if you go to law and order, you go to the economy, if you go [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=156.92s)]
*  to immigration, if you go to America's role on the world stage, I don't see where the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=160.56s)]
*  Democrats run on any policy of success. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=165.28s)]
*  Let's start at the border. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=169.16s)]
*  Let's start at the fact that we've identified ISIS, people with ISIS connections now in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=170.28s)]
*  this country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=175.56s)]
*  You know, then we've got people coming from Venezuela. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=176.56s)]
*  We have people coming from Yemen and Iran and Syria and Egypt and Afghanistan. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=179.12s)]
*  Thirty thousand Chinese nationals since October, 26,000 Chinese nationals last year, tens of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  thousands of, you know, unvetted Joe Biden, illegal immigrants from our top geopolitical [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=193.4s)]
*  foes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, Congressman, how is that not a clear and present danger to this country right now? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, it absolutely is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=205.88000000000002s)]
*  And Sean, everybody around the country recognizes that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=207.84s)]
*  We've been saying for three years every state's a border state now because it is. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=210.56s)]
*  As you and I have discussed so many times, we documented 64 specific executive actions [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  that Joe Biden took to open that border wide. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=219.52s)]
*  They've invited all these dangerous people into our country and they've taken up the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=222.6s)]
*  invitation and come here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=226.7s)]
*  It's a serious situation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=228.24s)]
*  The FBI directors testified three or four times in Congress now in recent months that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=229.6s)]
*  all the red lights are flashing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=233.72s)]
*  And what he means is we've got dangerous persons, we've got terrorists on our own shores in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=235.24s)]
*  our country because Joe Biden opened that border wide. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=240.12s)]
*  And everybody knows it, Sean. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=242.96s)]
*  I've been traveling around the country the last six months. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=244.36s)]
*  I've done events in 123 cities in 29 states now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=246.84s)]
*  And it doesn't matter whether I'm in a blue state, in a swing district, the message is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=250.44s)]
*  the same. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=254.96s)]
*  The people are fed up with this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=255.96s)]
*  They're fed up with the open border, what it's doing to them, their security, their [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=257.4s)]
*  feeling of safety, and of course the cost of living, the rising cost of crime, all these [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=260.8s)]
*  things that are compounding the problems that we can fix. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think for that reason, the American people are going to give us a chance to do that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=269.16s)]
*  Every crime, every murder, every rape. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=273.08s)]
*  And eventually, I pray to God I'm wrong, if a terror attack happens by Joe Biden's unvetted [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  illegal immigrants and his open borders policies, now at 11 million unvetted in this country, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=281.88s)]
*  he's got blood on his hands. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  What did President Trump specifically say he would do on the border? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=290.24s)]
*  I assume he probably said just go back to the policies that were working when he left [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=293.16s)]
*  office. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=298.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's the whole thing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=299.16s)]
*  See, President Trump is a bold leader and he understood. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=300.56s)]
*  He ran on the border. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=303.24s)]
*  He reminded us back in 2015, border, border, border, because he saw this disaster coming [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  and he got control of it because he used his authority. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=309.44s)]
*  He used executive orders for the right policies. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=312.56s)]
*  He instituted Remain in Mexico, where people had to stay on the other side of the border [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=315.8s)]
*  to adjudicate their claims for asylum. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  That's a no brainer. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  The Border Patrol agents have told us and the leaders of that agency said, if President [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=323.48s)]
*  Biden would just issue that executive order, Remain in Mexico again, we could reduce the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=328.0s)]
*  flow by 70 percent at the border. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=332.72s)]
*  But he will not do it, Sean. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  You know why? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  You know why? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  Because they want the open border because they want to turn these people into voters. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  And we're working hard to prevent that from happening as well. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=342.32000000000005s)]
*  So many problems. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=344.72s)]
*  What did the president say he'd do on the economy? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=345.72s)]
*  What did he say he'd do with Israel, with Ukraine? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  What did the president say that he would do to get energy prices down and get the American [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=353.92s)]
*  people get money back in their pocket? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=360.0s)]
*  Well, a lot on all of those fronts. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=362.56s)]
*  With regard to the economy, we've got to revive the American economy again. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5b9LtdkJU0&t=365.12s)]
