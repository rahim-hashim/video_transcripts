# Hannity: Biden’s embarrassing moments grow
**Fox News:** [February 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA)
*  And welcome to Hannity. Well, your president, Joe Biden, says fragility is becoming a major [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=0.0s)]
*  liability for Democrats and White House aides. They are struggling mightily to cover for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  him. Now, yesterday, while stopping in San Francisco as part of his California fundraising [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=11.9s)]
*  tour, well, Biden and Pelosi, look at that. Isn't that really nice? They're holding hands, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=17.5s)]
*  shuffling along the tarmac on their walk from Air Force One to Marine One. One social media [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  user pointed out, quote, It looked like a nursing home reunion or like they were headed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=29.52s)]
*  to play bingo together. Well, I kind of doubt that Joe would be able to play, but that's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=34.64s)]
*  a different story. But that wasn't Joe's only bizarre moment this week. On Tuesday, when [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=40.24s)]
*  boarding Air Force One using the baby steps in the back, not the big steps, well, Biden [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  stumbled not once, but twice before catching himself. Now, remember, he's been using the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=52.0s)]
*  smaller steps to avoid these embarrassing moments on the big boy steps that he kept [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=58.4s)]
*  falling on. According to a new report, he is now wearing sneakers with extra thick soles. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=63.6s)]
*  I thought the new shoes or sneakers was supposed to help. Clearly, it's not working. Now, allegedly, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=70.56s)]
*  as part of his AIDS plan to stop him from falling and slipping as frequently. Well, anyway, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=76.72s)]
*  I'm not sure this is going to be the game changer they want it to be. But it is alarming [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=82.72s)]
*  to see all of this from your president. The physical decline, even over the last three [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=87.34s)]
*  years since he took office, it is growing more and more obvious every day. But still, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  well, his handlers in the White House. Remember, they once said he does more in an hour than [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=98.7s)]
*  most people do in a day. That's right up there with the borders are secure. That's right [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=103.42s)]
*  up there with the other lie that never once did he speak to his brother or his son or [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=108.26s)]
*  anybody for that matter about their foreign business dealings. But anyway, they are working [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=112.58000000000001s)]
*  harder to cover up what is an obvious decline. Now, apparently, putting the full court press [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=116.9s)]
*  on the White House and White House reporters over their coverage of your failing president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=122.06s)]
*  According to a new report, White House counsel, spokesperson, some guy named Ian Sams, I don't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=127.42s)]
*  think he likes me. He actually sent a letter to members of the White House Correspondence [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=133.62s)]
*  Association. Why? Complaining that news outlets were misreporting the findings in the damning [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=137.74s)]
*  special counsel report. But the whining from one of Biden's top propagandists is apparently [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=145.86s)]
*  all is not going over too well with his friends and the liberal media mob reporters, according [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=151.42s)]
*  to one Washington reporter who's covered the Biden White House. Well, many of the media [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=157.46s)]
*  mob so-called journalists, they are growing tired of the administration's, quote, nagging [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=162.3s)]
*  and complaining. And remember, earlier this week, a New York Times publisher said that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=167.94s)]
*  the White House is, quote, extremely upset with the paper's coverage of Biden's age [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=173.3s)]
*  and unpopularity. Well, at some point, the White House, they have a reality they have [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  to face and see what everyone else has been seeing for a much longer period of time. Now, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=183.18s)]
*  whether that's now or in November, and by the way, speaking of November, well, day after [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  day, the slew of disastrous polls for Biden, it just continues. Look at this new poll. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=194.5s)]
*  The polls show that Joe Biden is over 60. It's a little bit of a shock to the White [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=201.1s)]
*  House. It's a little bit of a shock to the White House. It's a little bit of a shock [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=205.82s)]
*  to the White House. It's a little bit of a shock to the White House. It's a little bit [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=210.22s)]
*  of a shock to the White House. It's a little bit of a shock to the White House. It's a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  little bit of a shock to the White House. It's a little bit of a shock to the White [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=219.06s)]
*  House. It's a little bit of a shock to the White House. It's a little bit of a shock [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=222.5s)]
*  to the White House. It's a little bit of a shock to the White House. It's a little bit [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  of a shock to the White House. It's a little bit of a shock to the White House. It's a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=230.9s)]
*  little bit of a shock to the White House. Black [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=236.94s)]
*  Trump? Well, he's up there by three. He was up by about five in another poll. In Pennsylvania, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=253.18s)]
*  now Trump leads Biden by two points there. Now, in 2020, Biden won all of those states, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  with the exception of North Carolina. But now, according to this round of polls, well, he is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=265.5s)]
*  running far behind Trump. But don't worry. As Biden struggles mount, your vice president, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=270.86s)]
*  Kamala Harris, who's miraculously even less popular with Joe at a 28% approval rating, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  well, feel confident. She is waiting in the wings. And earlier this week, her husband said, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=284.14s)]
*  they're living out the show Veep. Really? You can't make this up. Take a look. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=289.74s)]
*  Vice President Harris is one of the most Googled, photographed and talked about people on the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=295.9s)]
*  planet. So you might think we already know everything there is to about her, but we happen [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=299.58s)]
*  to have the one person here who can shed a little more light on the Veep. So do you watch Veep? Have [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=303.9s)]
*  you ever seen Veep? We're living it. You're living it. Yes, you are. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=308.46s)]
*  By the way, did he ever see the show? Guess what it's about. A gaff-prone vice president who [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=313.82s)]
*  fumbles her way to power and stumbles into the presidency. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=320.46s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb1VOL9Q0WA&t=333.9s)]
