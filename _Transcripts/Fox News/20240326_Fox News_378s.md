# Ted Cruz: This is the greatest assault on democracy in the history of America
**Fox News:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M)
*  Here with reaction, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, anything I'm saying there constitutionally, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=0.0s)]
*  you're a great scholar. You've argued before the Supreme Court. Alan Dershowitz has said, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=5.68s)]
*  even though he disagrees with you politically, you're one of the smartest debaters and students [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=10.48s)]
*  he ever had. Am I right on the Constitution? Sean, you are absolutely right. What we are [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=14.4s)]
*  seeing across the board in the legal system is the weaponization and the politicization of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=21.44s)]
*  our legal system. In over two centuries of our nation's history, a president has never been [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=26.88s)]
*  indicted. A former president has never been indicted. In just over one year, Donald Trump [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  has been indicted four times by partisan Democrat prosecutors who hate his guts. On top of that, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  you have the ridiculous civil lawsuit by Letitia James, a partisan Democrat who ran on the promise [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=44.32s)]
*  to quote, get Donald Trump and got a $450 million judgment against him. She wants to take a half [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=51.52s)]
*  billion dollars from him for an offense that injured nobody, that there was no harm and that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=58.720000000000006s)]
*  the supposed victim who made money on it were giant international banks. It is absurd. And here's the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=63.84s)]
*  most important thing to understand. It is not just that Democrats hate Donald Trump. They do, to be [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  sure. But the real target here is you, the American voters. This is an assault on democracy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=76.88s)]
*  And Democrats love to beat their chest and say we're defending democracy, but the reason all of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=84.16s)]
*  these cases are being brought is because Democrats are terrified that the voters in November are [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  going to reelect Donald Trump as president and they're trying to bring the entirety of the legal [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=95.12s)]
*  system to stop the voters. This is the greatest assault on democracy literally in the history of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  our country. And we're seeing it with every elected Democrat quietly applauding and celebrating [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=105.84s)]
*  this assault. You know, where's Merrick Garland? Don't we call the department he heads up? It's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=112.48s)]
*  called, correct me if I'm wrong, the Department of Justice. I believe in equal justice under the law, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=120.0s)]
*  equal application of our laws. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, in every one of those Trump organization [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=127.2s)]
*  deals when they were applying for loans and applying for insurance policies, there was a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=133.84s)]
*  disclaimer in every one of them saying don't use our valuations. By the way, nobody lending [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=138.8s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars or insuring hundreds of millions of dollars in property [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=144.56s)]
*  would ever go with somebody else's valuations. They have a fiduciary responsibility to do their own. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=150.32s)]
*  So you have a disclaimer in there saying don't use our valuations. And then if this whole case [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  is about valuation, can you explain to me how the judge to this day is still adhering to a value of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=163.68s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago at a mere $18 million when in fact you can't get it, you can buy a two acre lot on the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  ocean in Palm Beach, Florida. That's 200 million. This has 22 acres. It has the intercoastal. It [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  has the ocean. It has a historic building. It's got two clubs. And I might add it's in pristine [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=185.84s)]
*  condition with 50 some odd bathrooms and bathrooms. So you tell me, Senator, does Merrick Garland not [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=191.04s)]
*  have a duty? Does he not see what's going on? Judges like this allowed to sit on the bench [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=197.68s)]
*  and put out half a billion dollars in fines? Really? Is that our country? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  Look, of course Merrick Garland sees what's going on, but he wants this to happen. Merrick Garland [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=209.44s)]
*  is the most politicized attorney general in history. This Department of Justice has been weaponized. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=214.88s)]
*  And listen, I want everyone at home to think about in terms of what Letitia James argued. She says [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=220.8s)]
*  that Trump overvalued his real estate. Well, think about it. How many of y'all have ever gotten a home [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=226.16s)]
*  mortgage? If you get a home mortgage, you go to your bank and say, you know what, I love this house. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=230.8s)]
*  It's really pretty. The backyard. I love the flowers and trees. I think the house is worth [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  $10 million. Now, is there a bank on earth that would say, okay, if it's worth $10 million, we'll [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=240.0s)]
*  give you a $10 million mortgage? No, they'll send an appraiser. They'll look at it and they'll tell [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  you, this is what it's worth. And we ain't giving you a penny more. In this instance, the victim was [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=249.68s)]
*  Deutsche Bank, a global multi-billion dollar company. They know how to value real estate. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=255.28s)]
*  Their testimony at the trial is they thought these loans were great loans. They were thrilled. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=260.8s)]
*  They said Donald Trump was a whale. They made money on them. They wanted to make more loans [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=265.12s)]
*  just like it. And you mentioned Mar-a-Lago. The idea, you and I have both been to Mar-a-Lago. It's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=270.88s)]
*  an incredible property. The idea that it's worth $18 million. You can't buy a hot dog stand in Palm [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=275.84s)]
*  Beach for $18 million. When I last saw Trump at Mar-a-Lago, I told him, I said, I'll tell you what, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=282.56s)]
*  Mr. President, I'll give you 20 million for it right now. I don't have 20 million, but if you say [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  yes, I promise you I can raise it in 60 seconds. And of course he laughed because it is absurd. It [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=292.24s)]
*  is a property that is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But look, that smarmy, sanctimonious, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=298.88s)]
*  smiling judge is a vicious partisan who hates Donald Trump and he loved, I'm going to take [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=305.68s)]
*  a half billion dollars from you because I hate you, rule of law be damned. And did one Democratic [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=312.4s)]
*  in New York speak out against it? And by the way, who in their right mind would do business in New [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=318.56s)]
*  York? Because you know what? First, Letitia James comes from Donald Trump, but the next business [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=323.44s)]
*  owner who ticks off the Democrats in power, they're going to come and take millions from you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=328.32s)]
*  This is a catastrophic decision for the rule of law in New York. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=333.2s)]
*  Senator Cruz, and I want people to understand that Chuck Schumer has made Senator Cruz's number one [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=337.92s)]
*  target. And literally tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars are going into Texas to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=343.52s)]
*  smear the Senator. Senator, we need you back. I'm not very happy with the number of your colleagues [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=350.08s)]
*  for not being conservative. You have been a staunch, steady conservative voice and a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=355.76s)]
*  fighter. We need you back in the Senate. So we appreciate you being here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEpm_s1x6M&t=361.36s)]
