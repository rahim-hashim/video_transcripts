# Jonathan Turley: Media played a 'drumbeat on a single narrative' in Trump 'lunging' story
**Fox News:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM)
*  All right, breaking news tonight out of the Trump Georgia case today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, the Fulton County judge down there, Scott McAfee, dismissed six charges against Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=5.16s)]
*  and his co-defendants, saying that the state failed to allege sufficient detail for six [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=10.64s)]
*  counts of solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=15.82s)]
*  And last week, the judge confirmed he is now on track to issue a ruling this week on whether [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  to remove the Fulton County DA, Fonny Willis, from the case following a hearing on her alleged [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  prosecutorial misconduct. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=32.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, a new bombshell report alleges that the January 6th committee, you know, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=34.16s)]
*  the one I kept telling you had a predetermined outcome, that they withheld crucial evidence, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=40.16s)]
*  get this, including testimony from Trump's driver that refutes Cassidy Hutchinson's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=45.0s)]
*  Trump tried to lunge for the steering wheel and commandeer his presidential SUV back to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=52.48s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=59.0s)]
*  The report also concluded that Trump did in fact instruct his staff ahead of January 6th [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=60.12s)]
*  to offer 10,000 National Guard troops to the Capitol for extra security, something he and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=66.36s)]
*  his officials have all said publicly. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  Four of the five people in the room said it to me on the record. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=75.96s)]
*  They had this information. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=80.2s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=81.56s)]
*  ...calling up the Guard, and then it becameâ€”the chain of command went to Nancy Pelosi and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=82.56s)]
*  to the mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  Did you, as required by law, authorize that? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=92.24s)]
*  One hundred percent, and attested to by many people, and they turned it down. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=95.96s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi turned it down. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=103.28s)]
*  Mayor Bowser's written refusal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=105.52s)]
*  The communications between the leader of the Capitol Police and their chain of command [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=107.42s)]
*  to the DOD refusing our request to allow National Guardsmen and women to stage on January 4 [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=112.26s)]
*  and 5 before January 6. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  Did you both ask for the National Guard to be called up? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=120.98s)]
*  Without a doubt, Sean. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=126.38s)]
*  We've made that very clear, not just once, but on numerous occasions. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  We wanted to make sure that there was plenty of National Guard on the ready in case there [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=132.06s)]
*  was some kind of violence. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=137.5s)]
*  I had a meeting with President Trump on the 3rd of January concerning some international [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=138.98s)]
*  threats, and at the very end, he asked if there were any requests for National Guard [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  support. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=150.22s)]
*  What was the president's response to you with regard to the request made by Mayor Bowser? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=151.22s)]
*  Call it and do whatever was necessary to protect the demonstrators. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=156.82s)]
*  And he said the same to me in an interview I had with him. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=164.14s)]
*  Now tonight, Congressman Barry Loudermilk, who chairs the subcommittee issuing the report, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=166.62s)]
*  is telling JustTheNews.com's John Solomon that he may make criminal referrals for obstruction [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=172.26s)]
*  and house ethics violations. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=178.78s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction to all of this, George Washington, university law professor, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=180.98s)]
*  Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=186.38s)]
*  So they had evidence and direct testimony from the Secret Service driver saying, no, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=188.73999999999998s)]
*  he never tried to commandeer the vehicle or reached over to take over the steering wheel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=194.74s)]
*  And they allowed that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=201.54s)]
*  They did not make that public. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=202.82s)]
*  Then we have the issue of apparently they lost a lot of information in interviews that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  would have been exculpatory. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  Then we have on record four out of five people, the other one was General Milley, in the room, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=213.66s)]
*  confirming to me in interviews that in fact Donald Trump days before January 6th wanted [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=219.34s)]
*  to bring up the Guard, but the people that would need to ask for it said in writing in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=225.18s)]
*  the case of Muriel Bowser, no, and Nancy Pelosi said no. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  Why was that narrative never told to the American people during their prime time Hollywood production [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  hearings, professor? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, as you know, Sean, there was no alternative narrative presented. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  There were no alternative witnesses presented. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=248.98s)]
*  The committee didn't call in people with opposing accounts. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=251.34s)]
*  They didn't explore other explanations. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=255.32s)]
*  It was this drumbeat on a single narrative, and it was produced by this ABC producer they [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=258.06s)]
*  brought in to create this package. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=263.74s)]
*  And the committee could have been so much more. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=267.14s)]
*  But putting aside the fact that the committee really just refused to consider alternatives [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=270.54s)]
*  to its conclusions, you have this troubling argument thatâ€”or allegation that passwords [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  have been withheld, documents are missing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=284.38s)]
*  If you remember with this lunging story, the media ran with it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=287.1s)]
*  It was on every single network, as Trump was portrayed as this truly crazy person, lunging [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=291.54s)]
*  at his Secret Service driver trying to take control over the beast or the presidential [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=299.46s)]
*  limo. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=305.06s)]
*  That played over and over again. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=306.06s)]
*  And the committee members knew when people were reporting this that the driver denied [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=308.73999999999995s)]
*  it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=314.85999999999996s)]
*  This is a law enforcement officer who said it just didn't happen. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  And yet they allowed that false narrative to be played out there, including former representative [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=320.29999999999995s)]
*  Cheney. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=325.38s)]
*  And to the point that she'd come forward and say, you know what, let's be honest [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=326.98s)]
*  here, the person that would be most directly involved, the driver, denies it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=329.62s)]
*  So we didn't hear that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=334.94s)]
*  But it's really consistent with what we did not hear throughout the January 6 hearings, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=336.34s)]
*  which is any alternative narrative. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=343.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=346.02s)]
*  Let me ask you this, because there were others that were ignored also. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=347.38s)]
*  Even Lester Holt over at NBC News, and a credit to him, reported that, in fact, they had actionable [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=351.62s)]
*  intelligence that there were people that were plotting and planning and scheming January [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=359.3s)]
*  6 what happened that day, that they had actionable intelligence. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=366.38s)]
*  But they failed to act. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=370.78s)]
*  Now, the Capitol Police chief initially said, I don't think we'll need the guard. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=372.06s)]
*  But in the final days leading up to January 6â€”and he wrote about this in his book, and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=376.74s)]
*  he said it to me in an interview that I've had here and on my radio showâ€”that, in fact, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  once he saw new intelligence, he was begging for the National Guard. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=387.5s)]
*  And nobody would give it to him. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=392.74s)]
*  And is it one of the worst things that we can conclude out of this sham Hollywood production [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=394.62s)]
*  hearing of Liz Cheney and company, the fact that they never dealt with the question of, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=401.1s)]
*  how do we ever prevent something like this from happening again? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=405.98s)]
*  They never came up with any solutions, Professor. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=409.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=414.85999999999996s)]
*  I remember when all of us were doing the coverage on that day, one of my first responses before [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=415.85999999999996s)]
*  the riot began is I had never seen the Capitol so thinly protected for a major event like this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=419.9s)]
*  It was that obvious. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=425.82s)]
*  We were showing pictures of just a few bicycle cops behind temporary fences. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  And it was glaring, because just the previous summer, you had a violent riot that caused [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=432.34s)]
*  the president to be removed to a safe room. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=438.06s)]
*  Very large number of officers were injured. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=441.46s)]
*  There was arson. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=443.82s)]
*  There was property damage. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=444.82s)]
*  And they had to call out the National Guard and put up fencing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=446.34s)]
*  So this was an obvious move that was being suggested by the White House. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=449.41999999999996s)]
*  They had literally just gone through this. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=453.28s)]
*  And the reporting later said that Pelosi felt that the optics were not going to be good. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=455.9s)]
*  That's part of what we want to get some answers to as the House works through what was not [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=463.34s)]
*  disclosed during these proceedings. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=469.06s)]
*  Yeah, great point. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=471.3s)]
*  You remember Ray Donovan in the Reagan years, you know, after a long investigation, he's [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=473.54s)]
*  vindicated. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=477.94s)]
*  Where do I go to get my good name back? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=478.94s)]
*  Is Donald Trumpâ€” [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=481.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=482.22s)]
*  Will the country ever hear all of this? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=483.22s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=485.98s)]
*  Any major network or fake news, CNN or MSDNC, will ever report any of this. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=487.18s)]
*  That's pretty sad. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=493.38s)]
*  Let me transition, if I may, to the issue of Fonny Willis. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=495.66s)]
*  What do you think will happen in this case as it relates to her? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=498.86s)]
*  And what should happen, in your view? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=503.38s)]
*  Well, this case is disassembling in front of our eyes. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=506.02000000000004s)]
*  This was a very basic error. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=511.0s)]
*  You know, this is a major case, but these prosecutors didn't put together the most [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=512.86s)]
*  basic narrative or facts that have to support these counts. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=518.74s)]
*  The question is, what did the grand jury know? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=523.14s)]
*  If it wasn't in the indictment, how did they vote out these crimes? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=525.02s)]
*  What were they told as the basis? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=528.66s)]
*  Because the judge just said, you're not even telling the defendant what he needs to know [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=530.98s)]
*  to defend himself. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=534.72s)]
*  I don't know what facts you're alleging here. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=536.02s)]
*  Now, they could go back to the grand jury and get a superseding indictment, but that's [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=538.66s)]
*  going to take time. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=542.82s)]
*  It's going to take time off the clock. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=543.82s)]
*  And they might have a problem doing what is obviously their overriding purpose here, which [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=545.66s)]
*  is to try Donald Trump before the election. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=550.66s)]
*  They could just go without these counts. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=554.26s)]
*  The judge said, I'll let you refer to the underlying conduct. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=557.1s)]
*  I just won't let you use them as standalone crimes for these particular counts unless [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=560.9s)]
*  you go back to the grand jury. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=566.5799999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you about Robert Herr and get your reflections on this. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=569.3s)]
*  When one question by a California congressman, Congressman Kiley, was put towards the special [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=573.86s)]
*  counsel Robert Herr, yeah, oh yeah, jurors can definitely, yeah, they definitely would [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=581.42s)]
*  be able to find him guilty. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=586.64s)]
*  That was one of the more interesting things to me. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=589.14s)]
*  And the idea that Joe Biden says to his ghostwriter, oh, I found more top secret documents in my [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=591.12s)]
*  basement. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=599.52s)]
*  Let me read them to you, even though you don't have a security clearance. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=600.52s)]
*  What does that say about equal justice and application of our laws? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=604.36s)]
*  Well, that was what was the most powerful aspect of Herr's testimony. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=609.52s)]
*  As a criminal defense attorney, I was listening and thinking, you know, what for the grace [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=615.04s)]
*  of God go why? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=619.96s)]
*  If I had a client with this amount of evidence against him, I doubt seriously prosecutors [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=621.0s)]
*  would have any hesitation. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=626.08s)]
*  They had 40 years of mishandling classified material. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=627.08s)]
*  They had one key party who tried to destroy it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=631.54s)]
*  They have the defendant acknowledging that he had it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=635.04s)]
*  It was traveling from spot to spot wherever he's working or living. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=638.62s)]
*  They had to talk about his memory because otherwise they had a lead pipe cinch of a [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=642.88s)]
*  case. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=647.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=648.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=649.16s)]
*  If this country is ever going to remain a constitutional republic, it better get equal [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  justice back quick. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=656.56s)]
*  Jonathan Turley, thank you. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFaFtCQxbM&t=658.1999999999999s)]
