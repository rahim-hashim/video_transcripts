# ‘NO QUESTION’ Donald Trump will be the president: Lara Trump
**Fox News:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA)
*  All right, James Carville, one of the most prominent political minds in the Democratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=0.0s)]
*  Party. He is now sounding the alarm in an interview with The New York Times. Carville [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=3.68s)]
*  saying Biden's poll numbers are, quote, kind of hard to get out of your mind, like he says, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=7.84s)]
*  it's like walking in on your naked grandmother, your grandma naked. You can't get that image out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  of your mind. I've debated James, know him really well, very nice guy, smart guy, but don't be fooled. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=18.16s)]
*  He's a hardcore leftist Democrat. He's a left winger. Carville is particularly worried about [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=24.88s)]
*  men leaving his party. And in a comment that will likely get him in trouble with the woke mob, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=30.16s)]
*  Carville told The Times, quote, a suspicion of mine is that there are too many preachy females. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=34.8s)]
*  They don't drink beer and they don't watch football. Anyway, other Democrats seem more [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=40.08s)]
*  worried about third party candidates, especially Robert Kennedy Jr. The Biden campaign is now [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=44.32s)]
*  working overtime on a strategy to attack R.F.K. Jr. Now, of course, no one in the Democratic Party [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=49.6s)]
*  seems to have a plan to bolster, well, the vice president's terrible poll numbers. And over the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=55.68s)]
*  weekend in Puerto Rico, the vice president, as I mentioned earlier, seen accidentally clapping [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=61.28s)]
*  along to a group protesting against the Biden administration before someone helped translate [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=67.2s)]
*  the message. Anyway, here with reaction to all of this, she is the brand new RNC co-chair. Laura [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=72.8s)]
*  Trump is back with us. Laura, great to have you. Your reaction, they're so panicked, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=78.56s)]
*  not only really about R.F.K. If you go back to the State of the Union address, if you go back [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=83.36s)]
*  to Joe's West Coast swing last week, what did we see that was consistent? Joe is trying to build [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=88.88s)]
*  back his base. He's down 22 some odd points with African Americans. He's, you know, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=96.88s)]
*  Donald Trump has now pulled even with Hispanic Americans, suburban women, young people are [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=104.72s)]
*  abandoning Joe Biden. That is the core coalition base of the Democratic Party. What do you see? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=111.36s)]
*  Absolutely. Look, there are hemorrhaging voters on the Democrat side. It is a huge problem [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=118.32s)]
*  for the party. And the fact that you have the Biden campaign when you currently have the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=123.36s)]
*  Republican and Democrat nominees for president established worried about a third party candidate, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=129.60000000000002s)]
*  Sean, the alarm bells are certainly going off for them. And they're hemorrhaging all these voters [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=136.0s)]
*  because we have a unique opportunity right now to compare to presidents. We've seen four years of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=141.68s)]
*  Donald Trump. We know what he will do. People remember how much better life was for them [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  when Donald Trump was in office. You compare that to the last three years of Joe Biden as president. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=153.44s)]
*  People say we don't want this anymore. And it is showing the numbers you just referenced [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=158.56s)]
*  are huge. In 2020, Donald Trump got around 8% of the black vote. Right now he's polling [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=163.68s)]
*  in 2024 at 23% with black voters. Some polling actually has him up [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=170.08s)]
*  six points with Hispanic voters over Joe Biden. Look at the swing states right now. Look at North [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=176.88s)]
*  Carolina, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Florida. Donald Trump is leading Joe Biden in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=182.8s)]
*  all these states. Whenever you ask people around this country, what is your number one concern? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  Immigration. What is your number two concern? The economy. These are places where Joe Biden [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=194.8s)]
*  has consistently failed. People want common sense. They want their life back. They want a better life [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  and an easier life. And they know who delivered it for them. It was Donald Trump. And that is why [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  at the RNC we are very focused on this. We're going after all of those voters. Donald Trump [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=212.08s)]
*  is picking them off one by one. 224 days till election day. Okay. And you just took on this new [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=216.72s)]
*  role. The issue of convincing Republicans and conservatives to vote early and vote by mail, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=224.4s)]
*  something they have been resistant to, but also the legal ballot harvesting efforts that the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  Democrats seem to have mastered. Certainly you at least want to match if not surpass their efforts. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  Can you get that done in 224 days? That seems like a heavy lift. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=243.52s)]
*  It may be a heavy lift, but I'm here at the RNC right now. Look what time it is. We're working [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=249.36s)]
*  over time. I promise you we're focused on all of these things. We would love to have one day of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=254.0s)]
*  voting. We'd love to have voter ID and paper ballots. We can get back to that place, Sean, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=259.36s)]
*  but we have to do it by electing Donald Trump at the top of the ticket, expanding our lead in the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=264.08s)]
*  House and taking back the Senate. And then maybe we get back there one day. We got to play the hand [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=268.64s)]
*  that we're dealt. And that means as soon as you can go vote, go vote out there. And then you spend [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=273.2s)]
*  your time every single day from that day on until election day, taking people to vote. We are going [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=278.0s)]
*  to have a legal ballot harvesting operation at the RNC. It's something that has never been done before. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=283.84s)]
*  But yes, 224 days to victory. We are going to get it done because, Sean, we have no other options. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=288.88s)]
*  If Joe Biden is successful, if the Democrats are successful in November, it means they are able to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=295.76s)]
*  employ communist tactics, as you're just discussing, against their political opponents. It means that on [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=301.12s)]
*  the other side of this, we do not have the same country left. So we're focused, we're working hard, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=306.16s)]
*  and we're going to make sure that on November 5th, there are no questions. Donald Trump will [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=311.12s)]
*  unanimously be the President of the United States. These are consequential times. This is [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=315.28s)]
*  definitely an inflection point for the country. There is no doubt about it. This is a crucial [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=321.67999999999995s)]
*  election. I've said that in the past. This is it. Laura Trump, thank you. Good to see you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsEI7BN2RA&t=325.91999999999996s)]
