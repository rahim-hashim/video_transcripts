# Whistleblower says CIA 'stonewalled' DOJ from interviewing Hunter Biden's business associate
**Fox News:** [March 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA)
*  All right, welcome back to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=0.0s)]
*  A whistleblower has now come forward to allege that the CIA intervened to prevent Hunter [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=3.08s)]
*  Biden's sugar brother. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=7.92s)]
*  Remember we've told you all about him? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  That's the LA attorney, Kevin Morris, who gave Hunter all that money. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  They prevented him from being interviewed during the investigation into Hunter's taxes. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=14.8s)]
*  Now Chairman Jim Jordan and James Comer, they have launched an investigation writing to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=20.52s)]
*  the CIA director, quote, two DOJ officials allegedly summoned to CIA headquarters in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=25.72s)]
*  Langley Virginia for a briefing regarding Mr. Morris. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=32.76s)]
*  At that meeting, it was communicated that Mr. Morris could not be a witness during the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=37.28s)]
*  investigation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=41.48s)]
*  All right, here with more on this mystery is House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Okay, this makes no sense to me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=47.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=50.44s)]
*  Is he working for the CIA? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=51.44s)]
*  We don't know if he's an asset. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=55.72s)]
*  We don't know if he's regularly talking with someone who is being surveilled, maybe under [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=57.16s)]
*  the 702 program in the FISA statute. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=60.8s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=63.96s)]
*  But we'd like to know because again, this is not just anybody. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=64.96s)]
*  This is Kevin Morris, as you said, Sean, the guy who has loaned and or bought millions [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  of dollars for Hunter Biden, loaned him like $6 million, bought like I think a million [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=73.32s)]
*  dollars in artwork, you know, artwork from Hunter Biden. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=77.68s)]
*  So we'd kind of like to know what's going on here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=80.6s)]
*  And this all happened before the sweetheart deal was taken to the court in last last summer. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=83.24s)]
*  You know, the sweetheart deal that was laughed out of court. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=90.28s)]
*  And then of course, the DOJ says, oh, the guy who made the put the sweetheart deal together, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=93.12s)]
*  who takes it to court, gets laughed out of court. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=96.88s)]
*  That's the guy we're going to make special counsel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=98.6s)]
*  There are so many things wrong with this investigation that we think, frankly, the American people [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  deserve answers to. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=103.8s)]
*  And that's why Chairman Comer and I have sent the letter finding out, you know, why couldn't [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=105.44s)]
*  they talk to the guy? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=109.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=110.72s)]
*  So this is what we've had in 2016. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  We had the FBI involved in helping Hillary, followed up by the absolute abuse of a FISA [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=115.22s)]
*  warrant. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  Even James Comey, who signed three of the four warrants, said, knowing what I know now, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  I would not I would not have signed them a little too little too late. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=128.56s)]
*  No reasonable prosecutor would prosecute. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=133.16s)]
*  That other big moment that we had in 2020. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=135.6s)]
*  We had the FBI meeting weekly with Big Tech telling Big Tech they're likely going to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=139.2s)]
*  be victims of a misinformation campaign. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's probably going to be about Joe or Hunter Biden after they had fully vetted and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  verified the authenticity of Hunter's very real laptop. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  They knew they knew that Rudy Giuliani's lawyer Bob Costello had a copy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=156.56s)]
*  They knew it was going to leak. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=161.6s)]
*  Then when they finally leaked it, then they went to the FBI and said, is this what you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  were warning us about or is this a legitimate story? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=168.08s)]
*  The FBI wouldn't tell them the truth. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=171.36s)]
*  On top of the fact you had the 51 intel agents. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=173.72s)]
*  So you know, judge me whatever you whichever way you want, but call me one of the suspicious [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=176.96s)]
*  people. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=183.68s)]
*  I don't I don't trust what's going on here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=184.68s)]
*  Something doesn't smell right, Jim Jordan. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=187.56s)]
*  No, it sure doesn't. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  And you know, I think the biggest thing in that whole list of things that they've done [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=192.96s)]
*  in these several in the past several presidential elections, the really the big one was that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=197.16s)]
*  51 former intel officials who signed that letter. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=200.76s)]
*  Because remember that actually started when we deposed people that started with the campaign. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=204.04s)]
*  It was it was Anthony Blinken who called up Mike Morell, Mike Morell, who wanted to be [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=209.12s)]
*  CIA director in a Biden administration and ask him about this whole issue. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  Mike Morell goes to work, puts together the statement that says this has all the earmarks [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  of a Russian information operation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  These guys sign it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  They use it in the last debate. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  And then when the debate's over, Steve Reschetti running the campaign for Joe Biden calls up [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Mike Morell and thanks him for the statement. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=233.84s)]
*  It worked exactly like they planned. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  And I think that was the big election interference in the 2020 campaign. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  Keeping that valuable information from we the people right before the most important [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=243.32s)]
*  election we have the presidential election. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=246.88s)]
*  So yeah, all this comes along. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=248.48s)]
*  And now we hear about this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  So many strange things. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=251.64s)]
*  We just want the facts. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=252.84s)]
*  We want the truth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=253.84s)]
*  We'd like the Justice Department, the FBI to just stay out of the election and let we [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=254.84s)]
*  the people decide who we want to be president of our great country. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=258.8s)]
*  So we have all these shell corporations. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=263.62s)]
*  We have you have not identified any specific work or or performance or actions for the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=265.88s)]
*  millions and millions of dollars that this family has, even the grandchildren. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=273.64s)]
*  What services did they perform? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=277.88s)]
*  What did Hunter perform? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=279.64s)]
*  Then Joe on tape bragging he leveraged a million taxpayer dollars, got a prosecutor in Ukraine [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=281.32s)]
*  fired. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=286.2s)]
*  Hunter admits he has no experience in energy, oil, gas or Ukraine. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=287.76s)]
*  He didn't have experience for the CEFC, China's oil conglomerate. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  He says he was either high or drunk when he sent the WhatsApp message. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=297.16s)]
*  But it seemed pretty coherent to me for a guy that was out of his quote mind. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=302.08s)]
*  All of this information is out there and people say, well, where's the evidence? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=308.24s)]
*  And I'm like, what, what, what part of this smells right to you? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=312.8s)]
*  Because it's all pretty obvious. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=317.1s)]
*  Tony Bobolinski was pretty clear yesterday. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=318.48s)]
*  He sure was. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=322.44s)]
*  He did. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=323.44s)]
*  He did a fine job. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=324.44s)]
*  So did Jason Galanis. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=325.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=326.44s)]
*  Millions of dollars from foreign entities run through like 20 different companies for [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=327.44s)]
*  what? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=330.16s)]
*  Jim Biden and Hunter Biden weren't getting paid for their business acumen because they, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=331.16s)]
*  if you look at it, they owe all kinds of people all kinds of money, hundreds of thousands [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=336.0s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=340.08s)]
*  So it wasn't for their business. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=341.08s)]
*  What were they getting paid for? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=342.08s)]
*  Hunter Biden's business partner told us it was for access to the brand. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=343.08s)]
*  The brand was Joe Biden and the brand played golf, took phone calls, took meetings, went [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=347.12s)]
*  to lunches, went to dinners with Hunter Biden and his business associates and influenced [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=352.16s)]
*  the business. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=356.48s)]
*  That I think came out loudly and clearly yesterday in the hearing from both Mr. Bobolinski and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=357.48s)]
*  Mr. Galanis. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=362.24s)]
*  In enough evidence that proves candidate Joe Biden and President Joe Biden lied through [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=364.44s)]
*  his teeth, I never once talked to my son, my brother or anybody for that matter about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=369.16s)]
*  the foreign business deals. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=374.44s)]
*  No, he was having dinner at the Cafe Milano and calling in and making conference calls [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=375.64s)]
*  when the big meetings were going on. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=380.84s)]
*  But he did nothing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=383.72s)]
*  Never talked about it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=384.72s)]
*  He sure was. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=385.72s)]
*  All right, Jim Jordan, thank you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLyX2BmuzA&t=386.72s)]
