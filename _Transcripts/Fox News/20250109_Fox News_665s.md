# Hannity: California is the ‘greatest example’ of how this agenda plays out
**Fox News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ)
*  Now, in just a moment, we're going to show you a remarkable scene in D.C., Donald Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Barack Obama, George W. Bush, the Clintons, Kamala Harris, all gathered together for Jimmy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=5.08s)]
*  Carter's funeral. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  And coming up, we have a body language expert who's going to analyze—appears to be a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=12.44s)]
*  very friendly conversation between Donald Trump and Barack Obama. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=17.12s)]
*  I've got to find out what that was about. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=20.88s)]
*  While Kamala looked on, well, seemingly with envy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  But first, a warning to those on the left, those of you that are obsessed, those of you [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=26.64s)]
*  that believe with religious fervor in this eco-socialist, Marxist, statist utopia under [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=32.16s)]
*  the Green New Deal, it's not going to end well. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=39.88s)]
*  Pay attention to what's happening in California. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=43.2s)]
*  You know, free universal healthcare, daycare, childcare, guaranteed healthy food and housing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=45.72s)]
*  and retirement, everything taken care of, cradle to grave, womb to the tomb, college [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=52.08s)]
*  tuition, universal basic income, dedication to putting CO2 emissions above all else. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=57.6s)]
*  It might sound alarming still to some of you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  It is—look at California. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=67.88s)]
*  It is a disaster. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=69.6s)]
*  You know, take a look at this state, this so-called progressive, one-party, deep blue [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=70.6s)]
*  state. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=76.48s)]
*  pursuing their own version of the Green New Deal for many, many years now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=78.04s)]
*  They spend $31 billion a year only on social welfare programs. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=82.84s)]
*  The state's $322 billion budget also funded some fire prevention and water projects. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=88.4s)]
*  None of them have been completed because of permitting, environmental reviews. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=95.04s)]
*  You know, it was what, 11 years ago, California broke ground on a $100 billion high-speed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=100.36s)]
*  rail system. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  It's nowhere near completion. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=108.92s)]
*  In fact, not even—the first section of tracks has not even been finished. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=110.56s)]
*  In L.A., throughout the state, billions and billions are also spent on DEI programs, billions [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  more on green energy projects like L.A.'s 800 electric street sweepers. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  They cost $800 grand apiece. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  At the very same time, the city can't find enough money for its fire department to fund [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=133.36s)]
*  them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=139.0s)]
*  Recently, the mayor cut $17.5 million from the department's budget. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=140.0s)]
*  The fire chief wrote a letter to Mayor Bass warning the budget cuts would severely limit [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  their disaster response capabilities, like this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  Keep in mind, wildfires, they are common in Southern California. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=155.4s)]
*  Mayor Bass apparently doesn't care. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=159.36s)]
*  She, of course, was in Ghana when the fire broke out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=161.68s)]
*  When she did finally return to the U.S., the mayor ducked any and all questions about her [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=164.36s)]
*  role in the disaster. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  The next day, she refused to take any responsibility and didn't even know, you know, where to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=172.88s)]
*  direct people on the web or what number to call. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=179.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=182.72s)]
*  We have to protect lives. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=184.08s)]
*  We have to save lives. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=186.36s)]
*  And we have to save homes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=188.08s)]
*  Rest assured that when that is done, when we are safe, when lives have been saved and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=191.08s)]
*  homes have been saved, we will absolutely do an evaluation to look at what worked, what [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=201.28s)]
*  didn't work, and to correct or to hold accountable any body, department, individual, et cetera. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=207.44s)]
*  But my focus right now is on the lives and on the homes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=215.68s)]
*  Do you think your leadership was effective while responding to this disaster? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=220.04s)]
*  I just said what I believe is the most important thing for us to do right now, and that is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=224.24s)]
*  going to continue to be my focus. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=230.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=231.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=232.6s)]
*  A little too little, a little too late. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=233.6s)]
*  They could have cleared the brush, the kindling for these fires. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=235.44s)]
*  They could have had control burns to prevent these fires from getting out of control. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=238.38s)]
*  And they could have had water available from the minute they started. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=243.12s)]
*  Karen Bass wasn't the only so-called leader in California passing the buck. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=246.64s)]
*  This week, we told you the fire hydrants, they ran out of water, in part because of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=250.96s)]
*  statewide environmental regulations. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  L.A. County, meanwhile, they sent a widespread evacuation order by mistake last night, causing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=257.52s)]
*  mass panic and confusion. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=264.36s)]
*  Over on fake news CNN, well, California governor or old buddy Gavin Newsom took absolutely [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=266.7s)]
*  no responsibility. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=271.96s)]
*  Well, that's up to the local people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=272.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=274.76s)]
*  What is the situation with the water? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, in the Palisades, it ran out last night in the hydrants. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=277.92s)]
*  I was talking to the firefighter on this block. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=280.56s)]
*  They left because there was no water in the hydrant here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=282.28s)]
*  Local folks are trying to figure that out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=285.76s)]
*  I mean, just when you have a system where it's not dissimilar to what we've seen in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=287.36s)]
*  other extraordinarily large-scale fires, whether it be pipe, electricity, or whether it just [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=290.58s)]
*  be the complete overwhelm of the system. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=295.44s)]
*  I mean, those hydrants are typical for two or three fires, maybe one fire. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=298.12s)]
*  You have something at this scale. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  But again, that's going to be determined by the local. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  The parties are saying part of it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=305.16s)]
*  You local folks, do you figure it out? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=307.36s)]
*  So let me get this straight. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=310.12s)]
*  You have a state known for wildfires. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=311.12s)]
*  They don't have hydrants that have water. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=313.74s)]
*  The state regularly is dumping millions and millions of gallons of water into the Pacific [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=316.04s)]
*  Ocean instead of filling reservoirs for such emergencies like this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=321.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=326.48s)]
*  Because of environmental concerns about a delta smelt or whatever small fish they're [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=327.48s)]
*  trying to protect. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  But according to the governor, the locals will need to sort it out themselves. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=333.76s)]
*  And it's up to local mayors like that genius mayor of L.A., Mayor Bass, to figure this [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=338.24s)]
*  out. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=343.48s)]
*  And today Newsom even tried to avoid answering questions from a woman. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=344.48s)]
*  This woman lost everything. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=348.36s)]
*  Everything. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=349.96s)]
*  I mean, she's desperate. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=350.96s)]
*  The governor seemingly pretending to get on the phone with Joe Biden. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=352.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=356.84s)]
*  That was my daughter's school, governor. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=357.84s)]
*  Please tell me what you're going to do. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=358.84s)]
*  I'm not going to hurt her. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=359.84s)]
*  I promise. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=360.84s)]
*  I'm literally talking to the president right now to specifically answer the question of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  what we can do for you and your daughter. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  Can I hear it? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=370.0s)]
*  Can I hear your call? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=371.0s)]
*  Because I don't believe it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=372.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=374.67999999999995s)]
*  There's literally I've tried five times. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=375.67999999999995s)]
*  That's why I'm walking around to make the call. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  Why is the president not taking your call? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  Because it's not going through. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=381.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=382.76s)]
*  I have to get self-service. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=383.76s)]
*  So let's get it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=384.76s)]
*  Let's get it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=385.76s)]
*  I want to be here when you call the president. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=386.76s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=387.76s)]
*  I'm walking out and immediately get reimbursements, individual assistance and to help young girls. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=388.76s)]
*  Devastating. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=394.48s)]
*  I'm so sorry, especially for your daughter. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=395.48s)]
*  I have four kids losing the school. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  Everyone who went to school there, they lost their homes. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=400.48s)]
*  They lost two homes because they were living in one building another. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=403.8s)]
*  Governor, please tell me, tell me, what are you going to do with the president right now? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=407.2s)]
*  We're getting, we're getting the resources to help rebuild. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=411.12s)]
*  Why was there no water in the hydrants, governor? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=413.76s)]
*  It's all literally. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=418.16s)]
*  Is it going to be different next time? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=419.16s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=420.16s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=421.16s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=422.16s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=423.16s)]
*  To fill the hydrants. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=424.16s)]
*  I would fill them up personally. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=425.16s)]
*  You know that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=426.8s)]
*  I would fill up the hydrants myself. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=427.8s)]
*  But would you do that? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=430.8s)]
*  I would do whatever I can. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=432.8s)]
*  But you're not. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=434.8s)]
*  It's what they didn't do beforehand. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=436.52s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of people now must begin the process of trying to rebuild their [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  lives. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=443.8s)]
*  And by the way, trying to call Joe Biden, given his, you know, frequent naps, it's probably [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=444.92s)]
*  unlikely he was on the phone or willing to pick up the phone. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=449.8s)]
*  Needless to say, there is virtually no leadership out of Washington, D.C. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=453.36s)]
*  And today, the president, kind of like yesterday, only concerned about himself, actually joked [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=457.92s)]
*  about the fire. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=464.36s)]
*  It's not a joke. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=465.36s)]
*  While introducing Kamala Harris, take a look. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=466.36s)]
*  Madam Vice President, I know you're directly affected, so you fire away. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=469.36s)]
*  No pun intended. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=475.36s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=476.36s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=477.36s)]
*  No pun intended, really, Joe? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=480.0s)]
*  At yesterday's presser, Biden made it all about himself. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=482.0s)]
*  He was proud of the fact that he was a great grandfather and only seemed concerned about [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=485.48s)]
*  his son, zero-experience Hunter, and that he may have lost his house. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=490.3s)]
*  His vice president, meanwhile, a longtime advocate for the less radical socialist Green [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=495.06s)]
*  New Deal equity obsession. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=499.56s)]
*  Well, here she is in 2022, vowing to dole out any disaster relief on the basis of racial [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=501.52s)]
*  and environmental equity. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=508.4s)]
*  Listen. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=510.4s)]
*  It is our lowest-income communities and our communities of color that are most impacted [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=511.4s)]
*  by these extreme conditions and impacted by issues that are not of their own making. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=520.08s)]
*  And women. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=527.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=528.48s)]
*  And so we have to address this in a way that is about giving resources based on equity, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=529.76s)]
*  understanding that we fight for equality, but we also need to fight for equity, understanding [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=536.96s)]
*  not everyone starts out at the same place. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=540.72s)]
*  And if we want people to be in an equal place, sometimes we have to take into account those [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=543.58s)]
*  disparities. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=547.32s)]
*  Got to take that into account. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=548.32s)]
*  This is madness. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=550.82s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=551.82s)]
*  California is the greatest example of how this woke, equity-obsessed, environmental, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=553.1800000000001s)]
*  radical socialism, Green New Deal, statism, Marxism, socialism, this is how it plays out. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=559.7800000000001s)]
*  This is what America avoided in this last election. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=567.4200000000001s)]
*  Feel-good programs prioritized over infrastructure, safety, leaders who chose them for their identity [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=571.3000000000001s)]
*  instead of their merit, the city's preparedness, capabilities decline. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=578.0400000000001s)]
*  It is a disaster waiting to happen. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=582.96s)]
*  That would be, this would be, common is America. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=586.1600000000001s)]
*  God forbid if she won. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=589.5600000000001s)]
*  Thank God all of you stopped that madness from happening. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=591.24s)]
*  When you prioritize radical environmentalism, socialism, dependency, think about it, because [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=594.62s)]
*  how did the Green New Deal come about giving everybody a womb to the tomb, cradle to grave [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=601.96s)]
*  society? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=607.8000000000001s)]
*  When you go to dependency on government like this, we witnessed this all week in California. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  What happens? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=613.2s)]
*  It ends in disaster. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=614.2s)]
*  I've always said whatever name, whatever manifestation, socialism, Marxism, statism, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=615.2s)]
*  whatever manifestation, you get unfulfilled promises. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=620.72s)]
*  Then you end up paying and losing a fortune of money. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=624.0400000000001s)]
*  People are poor. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  And then you calculate how much freedom you gave up in the name of false security. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=628.86s)]
*  Sadly, thousands of homes, businesses were destroyed and it could have been prevented. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=632.96s)]
*  Fellow Americans lost everything. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=637.96s)]
*  And as for the environment, all the left, they claim so much about. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=640.0s)]
*  What about the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere from this week's fire? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=643.68s)]
*  It makes every one of their green measures null and void. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=649.36s)]
*  Anywhere else. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42dvDTYZ_RQ&t=662.88s)]
