# Sen. Josh Hawley: We need some answers on the Trump assassination attempt
**Fox News:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY)
*  This afternoon in Florida, a federal judge did rule that the man who attempted to kill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump the second time—this is at Trump International in West Palm Beach—will [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=3.68s)]
*  be held in prison until his trial. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Now, the move came after the DOJ released a cryptic letter written by the would-be assassin [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=10.44s)]
*  months before he attempted this attack on Donald Trump that admitted he had a desire [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=16.52s)]
*  to kill Trump, offering money to anybody who could successfully do so. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Now the DOJ released the letter because they needed evidence to convince the judge to keep [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=27.04s)]
*  the deranged lunatic in prison. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=31.92s)]
*  But did they really need to broadcast this, you know, offer, this bounty on somebody's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  head to the entire world? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=40.16s)]
*  Because it seems a little odd, and, you know, another reason why the state of Florida is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=41.64s)]
*  continuing, thanks to Ron DeSantis, to conduct their own investigation into what happened [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=46.2s)]
*  here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=51.2s)]
*  And what about the Secret Service? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=52.2s)]
*  We had an agent accidentally discharging his gun over the weekend while on duty. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  Anyway, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley is with us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=60.44s)]
*  Let me ask you about this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=63.4s)]
*  So they didn't secure the area that was known where paparazzi hang out, a vulnerable part [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=65.2s)]
*  of this golf course, within, you know, depending on which area you're in, they didn't secure [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=71.24s)]
*  the area. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=78.4s)]
*  And that, to me, is unconscionable on top of the Butler failure. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=80.28s)]
*  You have two assassins now coming within 100 to 300 yards of Donald Trump. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=83.84s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, it shouldn't be possible, Sean. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=95.36s)]
*  And here's the deal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=96.36s)]
*  I mean, we've had people from within Secret Service come forward to my office and say [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=97.36s)]
*  that it is standard protocol on that very golf course, which Trump plays all the time, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=101.16s)]
*  by the way, it is standard protocol to go and sweep it, number one, before he gets [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=105.56s)]
*  onto the course. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  Number two, where there are known vulnerabilities like where the paparazzi gather, which is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  where that shooter was, they normally post up agents there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  But they didn't do that on the day that Trump was nearly shot at again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=117.92s)]
*  Why in the world not? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we need some answers. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  And I tell you what, Sean, I listened to the directors, the Secret Service directors press [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  conference on Friday. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=127.44s)]
*  We didn't get any answers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=129.04s)]
*  He barely talked about anything. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=130.6s)]
*  It was all about, oh, well, we promised to do better and we're doing our own investigation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=132.12s)]
*  Listen, why don't you change some stuff? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=135.88s)]
*  Start protecting Donald Trump. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=138.42s)]
*  Start protecting the people who go to his rallies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=140.98s)]
*  The Secret Service is in a world of hurt right now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  And because of it, people are in danger. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=145.89999999999998s)]
*  They need to they need to give us some answers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=148.1s)]
*  The biggest problem I have and I will I think it's important to bifurcate out the agents [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  that were on the golf course with President Trump. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=156.98s)]
*  The amazing job all of them did. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=159.98s)]
*  They protected the president. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  They got him out of the area. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=163.66s)]
*  One very, very sharp guy happened to see the barrel of a gun. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=165.18s)]
*  In many ways, I would argue he got lucky. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=170.06s)]
*  He's great at his job. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=172.74s)]
*  He got lucky. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=174.12s)]
*  Those guys deserve our praise for their courage, for their heroism. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=175.12s)]
*  But you bring up the important point. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=179.66s)]
*  They didn't sweep the area. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=181.86s)]
*  And then the acting director said that the plan worked. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=183.52s)]
*  Now, that's like telling me that we had a sloped roof in Butler where they wouldn't [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  allow you to even inspect it right after the assassination attempt. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=192.3s)]
*  That was like that's that sloped roof, roof excuse. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=197.38s)]
*  And it wasn't a sloped roof. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=200.66s)]
*  So I don't know what to me if that plan is the one that worked. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=202.7s)]
*  How do you define failure? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=206.02s)]
*  Oh, exactly. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=207.5s)]
*  You know, I'll never forget, Sean, that director telling me under oath in a Senate hearing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=208.5s)]
*  that, boy, it really could have been a lot worse in Butler. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=213.94s)]
*  I mean, this it could have been like Dallas in 1963. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=216.78s)]
*  And I'm like, could have been. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=219.02s)]
*  I mean, a civilian was killed. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=220.94s)]
*  Trump was shot. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=222.62s)]
*  I mean, he was actually shot. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=223.62s)]
*  Let's not forget what happened there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=224.94s)]
*  And listen, now we've got another shooting attempt. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=227.9s)]
*  Clearly, what they're doing is not working. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=230.34s)]
*  Number one. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=232.46s)]
*  Number two, Sean, they're not following their own protocols. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=233.46s)]
*  That's what the whistleblowers tell me. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  And I just want to know, what's the truth here? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=237.3s)]
*  What's going on in the Secret Service? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=239.06s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=240.46s)]
*  It's leadership. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=241.46s)]
*  That's the problem here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=242.46s)]
*  These agents in the field, they're working their butts off. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=243.46s)]
*  They're doing what they can. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=245.84s)]
*  But their leadership is failing them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=247.26s)]
*  And I tell you what, they need to do something to instill some confidence. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  We need to see some people fired. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=252.1s)]
*  We need to see new protocols put into place. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=253.98s)]
*  We need to be assured that Trump is being protected and everybody going to his rallies [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=256.42s)]
*  are being protected. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=259.9s)]
*  And Sean, right now, I don't have confidence in any of that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=260.9s)]
*  Well, you know, I've been told by sources within the Trump camp that repeatedly they [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=264.34s)]
*  have asked for extra protection. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=270.06s)]
*  Repeatedly, they have been denied that protection. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=272.98s)]
*  You had any whistleblowers telling you the same? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  I've heard the same thing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  In fact, Sean, I heard that with regard to the Butler rally, even the Secret Service [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=283.09999999999997s)]
*  agents who were detailed to the Trump campaign, they were requesting more resources. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=287.74s)]
*  And Secret Service headquarters told them ahead of time, hey, don't make any more requests [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  for Butler. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=296.7s)]
*  We're not going to give you any more manpower. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=297.7s)]
*  And then, Sean, they turn around and tell us, oh, we never formally denied any additional [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=299.46s)]
*  resources to Butler. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=304.3s)]
*  Just because the Secret Service told them ahead of time, don't make any requests. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=305.74s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=309.14s)]
*  This is what I mean by Secret Service leadership here has a lot of explaining to do. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  And frankly, holding these press conferences where they don't answer any real questions, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=314.94s)]
*  they don't give us any real information, they assure us that things are working. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=318.58s)]
*  Things are not working. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=321.78s)]
*  When assassins are continuing to get within 100, 200 yards of the former president and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=323.38s)]
*  the current Republican nominee, they've got to do something different. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=328.38s)]
*  And it starts with being honest about what's going on. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=331.26s)]
*  Well, that's—if they think the plan works, that's not happening. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=334.82s)]
*  And I would be very clear here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=338.7s)]
*  We have to protect any politician, high-ranking, any presidential candidate, Democrat, Republican, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=341.34s)]
*  liberal, conservative. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  That's their job. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FS2hVJjdoY&t=349.09999999999997s)]
