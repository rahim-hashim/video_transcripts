# Rep. Mike Waltz: The Israelis know how to send a message
**Fox News:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI)
*  Back here now with more Florida congressman Michael waltz along with Fox and Friends weekend co-host Pete Hegseth congressmen start with you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, they gave up cell phones because they thought they thought the Israelis would be able to listen in on them [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  so they go to pagers the fact that they could [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=12.64s)]
*  identify all these top Hezbollah leaders and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=16.44s)]
*  simultaneously, you know [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=21.44s)]
*  Ignite all of those pagers. Maybe one of the most brilliant military operations. I've heard of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=23.48s)]
*  Yes, Sean the Israelis know how to send a message don't they and punting pun intended there [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=30.0s)]
*  But this was a masterful covert operation [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=35.82s)]
*  The Israelis intercepting the supply chain getting those distributed and then being able to set them off simultaneously [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=39.56s)]
*  It's an operation. I guarantee you that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=46.0s)]
*  Biden and Harris had the Israelis told him about it would have tried to shut down and would never approve for our own [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Intelligence community, but just look at the difference in the approach [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=55.96s)]
*  Biden and Harris [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=61.44s)]
*  Concession and chaos they're wearing our Navy out trying to deter Iran from launching more attacks [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=63.24s)]
*  You look at President Trump dry up the cash through maximum pressure and you look at the Israelis [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=70.52s)]
*  They take out a Hamas leader in downtown [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Tehran they take out a Hezbollah leader in downtown Beirut and now they cripple the entire [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=80.2s)]
*  Organization through this masterful covert operation against its peace through strength Trump knows it the Israelis know it [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Concession after concession leads to chaos. That's Biden and Harris and the contrast couldn't be more clear and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=93.44s)]
*  Pete especially considering that it was expected that Iran was going to use Lebanon and Hezbollah [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=100.0s)]
*  to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  Attack Israel in retribution for the military actions that they've taken inside of Iran [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=108.36s)]
*  They preemptively are protecting their own country [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=115.24s)]
*  For sure, this is why supply chains matter Sean [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  This was the the Congress is exactly right [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=123.52s)]
*  There was a Taiwanese company that was supplying pagers to Lebanon Hezbollah whether they knew it or not [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=126.35999999999999s)]
*  The Israelis intercepted those pagers and when they did they put based on reporting [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=131.68s)]
*  One to two ounces of explosives inside the pagers with a signal that would denote remote detonate them [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=137.36s)]
*  They knew they were going to Hezbollah [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=144.0s)]
*  So once they were delivered they waited until they were properly distributed and then at 330 local time [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  They sent a message. I'd love to know what the message said [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=152.18s)]
*  But because of the message most of these Hezbollah folks picked up their pager their hands were blown off [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=155.52s)]
*  It was a very clear signal sent. This is because Israel's playing for keeps [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=162.08s)]
*  They realized this is an existential threat. Yeah, the Carson's exactly right [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=167.28s)]
*  If the America had known about it, we had pulled it [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=171.32s)]
*  We would have pulled it back but think about our own bring it back to America our own supply chains dependent on batteries [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=173.44s)]
*  pharmaceuticals on electronics on chips [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=179.84s)]
*  Malware placed in those is a threat to us in this case the Israelis [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=182.76s)]
*  Intercepted it and did damage to terrorists. This could happen to us [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=188.2s)]
*  Which is why supply chains are very important in matter but genius in this case [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=191.72s)]
*  And and I don't know they'll probably war between Lebanon and Israel after this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=197.44s)]
*  Which Israel set in the tone for that, but they've sent a very clear message [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=202.28s)]
*  Yeah, I I've got to imagine that this probably put a lot of fear into the hearts of all these Hezbollah members [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  final word congressman [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=214.84s)]
*  Well, can you imagine Sean if if the CIA under Kamala Harris proposed such a clever and bold operation [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  The risk aversion the lack of understanding [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=226.72s)]
*  There is no way she would have ever had the guts to approve this no and and so but this is how you've got to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=230.12s)]
*  Deal with these terrorist organizations [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=236.32s)]
*  Yeah, no way. All right. We appreciate it congressman. Thank you Pete. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUe8VGgnfI&t=238.64s)]
