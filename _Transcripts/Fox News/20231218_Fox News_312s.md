# Ron Johnson: This has been a massive coverup
**Fox News:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0)
*  Here now with more is someone who has followed the money for quite some time, Wisconsin Senator [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=0.0s)]
*  Ron Johnson. Senator Johnson, you've been all over this. I can't say I'm surprised that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=4.96s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre doesn't want to answer questions. We just scrolled 20 pieces of evidence, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=10.56s)]
*  but don't the American people deserve more from the White House? You can't try to coordinate [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=15.6s)]
*  strategy with Hunter, as reports suggest, and then stonewall the press. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=19.76s)]
*  Well, Merry Christmas. And yes, the American people deserve the truth. And that's exactly [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=24.48s)]
*  what the House is going about doing. They are building on the record that Senator Grassley and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=30.32s)]
*  I built in terms of the inflow of tens of millions of dollars from countries that are adversarial to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=34.0s)]
*  this nation. The Bynes did nothing. And then what Chairman Comer and Jordan and Smith have been [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=40.24s)]
*  doing is they've been filling all the details. Where did this money flow out to? The IRS whistle [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=46.24s)]
*  blowers were key. But let's face it, it's been known that the Bynes have been operating something [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=51.2s)]
*  called Biden Inc. I didn't term that. I didn't coin that term. That was coined by, I think, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  Politico years ago. So the press was on the Bynes. They knew that the Bynes were selling [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  influence, trading off the family name. But once he became president, once he became the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=67.28s)]
*  candidate of the Democrats, they buried it all. They undermined our investigations. So the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=72.48s)]
*  Senator Grassley and I were soliciting and disseminating Russian disinformation. Does that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=77.76s)]
*  sound familiar? So again, this has been a massive coverup. You see the corruption within the news [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  media, but you also see corruption within our federal law enforcement, the FBI, the intelligence [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=87.04s)]
*  agencies, which is as big a story, if not bigger, than the corruption of the Biden Inc. crime family. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=91.44s)]
*  No, it's a huge story. I mean, look, I look at the testimony from Joseph Ziegler, from these [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=100.48s)]
*  whistleblowers, Gary Shapley. These are not partisan figures. These are people who are not [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=106.16s)]
*  Republicans. These are people who have integrity and came forward and said, we watched our [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  investigation be stymied time and time again. I mean, is this how the government operates? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=116.88s)]
*  We'll cover up for Biden Inc. and takes a whistleblower, a man of great courage, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=122.56s)]
*  to come forward to stop it? Yes. I mean, that is what has been revealed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=127.52s)]
*  Dating back to the Hillary Clinton email scandal, where you had that same cast of characters that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=132.72s)]
*  were in charge of Crossfire Hurricane, they're the ones that did the editing of the James Comey [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=136.8s)]
*  exoneration memo of Hillary Clinton. So this corruption has existed quite some time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=141.68s)]
*  It is a major story, the corruption in the media is a major story, but we also need to get the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=146.96s)]
*  truth on the Bidens. And I thought it was probably very interesting about the indictment, is all the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=151.84s)]
*  cash that Hunter Biden went through over the four years where he wouldn't pay $1.4 million in taxes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  He spent $4.9 million. $1.6 million of that was in cash. That's $1,000 a day. By the way, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=163.12s)]
*  is that maybe how Joe Biden got his 10% as the big guy in untraceable, cold, hard cash? Those are the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  kinds of questions that Chairman Colmer needs to ask Hunter Biden in a sworn affidavit, in a sworn [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=178.0s)]
*  deposition. That's why they need to get him behind closed doors and pepper him with questions [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=186.4s)]
*  from legal experts. You mentioned $4.9 million. And what's interesting about that, you have Kevin [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=191.52s)]
*  Morris, the star studded attorney, who reportedly, according to Joseph Ziegler, lent Hunter Biden $4.9 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=198.88s)]
*  million for all kinds of payments. I mean, who just shells out money and says, hey, here you go? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=206.88s)]
*  Why did he do that? More influence peddling? What is this? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  That's another $64,000 question, isn't it? It's obvious some kind of influence peddling. He's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=217.28s)]
*  expecting something in return. Now, people don't just shell out that kind of money without expecting [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=222.96s)]
*  something in return. Another thing that's, I think, very troubling, I think the media really needs to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=227.52s)]
*  ask this, Hunter, I know you're troubled. I know you had a drug problem, but not everybody the drug [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  problem spends $800,000 on women and adult entertainment abusing sex-trafficked women. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=237.92s)]
*  That'd be a question for the media. How many women, Hunter, did you abuse that were trafficked [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=246.0s)]
*  through international sex trafficking rings? It is grotesque. And I know President Biden was [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=251.04s)]
*  shelling out or offering to pay about $100,000 over a four-month period when Hunter was spending [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=257.68s)]
*  tens of thousands of dollars on these women. So again, this is corruption. It is vile. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=263.52s)]
*  And for Hunter to come out here and play the sympathy card and say that we're attacking him, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  we're not, we just need to get to the truth because an American president, part of this, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=273.84s)]
*  the head, the top, the pinnacle of this Biden crime family is compromised, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=279.68s)]
*  and it could be impacting our national security. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, you say it's a question for the media. I can tell you if I was standing at the podium, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=288.4s)]
*  the president's name was Donald Trump, and you had the hyenas in the press corps, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=292.48s)]
*  the question would be asked. Senator Johnson, thank you very much. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItQebNI10y0&t=296.0s)]
