# Sean Hannity: The world has no respect for Biden
**Fox News:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight in the Middle East, a paper tiger has been humbled and back at home. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=2.36s)]
*  Well, your president has never looked more weak. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=7.32s)]
*  Just 24 hours ago, Israel defied Joe Biden. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=10.74s)]
*  They launched a counterstrike against the Islamic Republic of Iran and they did it with [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=13.8s)]
*  just three missiles. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=19.32s)]
*  And Israel reportedly took out a critical missile defense system defending Iran's main [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=20.66s)]
*  nuclear facility. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Now, the message was very clear. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=28.96s)]
*  Israel can and they will obliterate Iran's nuclear program if the Islamic Republic dares [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  to launch another attack. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=37.44s)]
*  Now, Israel in many ways shocked the world as they showed, frankly, how easy it was for [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=39.04s)]
*  them to penetrate deeply into Iranian territory. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=45.24s)]
*  That's even after Biden abandoned them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=50.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=52.56s)]
*  To appease his radical Democratic base, which is the Radical Democratic Party. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=53.56s)]
*  Now, tonight, apparently that message was received according to Reuters. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=57.64s)]
*  Tehran is now playing down the attack and signaling that there will not be any retaliation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=61.72s)]
*  Also, tonight, there are three main losers in this international conflict. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=67.28s)]
*  Let's go through them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=72.04s)]
*  Without a doubt, the biggest loser from last night to today was Joe Biden. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  Now, late last week, you might recall when the Islamic Republic of Iran was about to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=79.6s)]
*  strike Israel, Biden politely told the mullahs in Iran, quote, don't. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=84.12s)]
*  And then he shuffled off to the beach. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=90.12s)]
*  The very next day, Iran, they attacked Israel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=91.92s)]
*  A hundred and seventy drone strikes, more than 30 cruise missiles, 120 ballistic missiles. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=94.76s)]
*  Ninety nine percent of them were stopped. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  They never landed at their target. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=104.2s)]
*  Now, a few days later, when Israel was planning their response, Biden once again uttered his [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=106.16s)]
*  favorite phrase. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=111.44s)]
*  Don't. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  This time he was telling Prime Minister Netanyahu, don't respond. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  Give Iran a pass. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=118.36s)]
*  Now, Israel then disregarded Biden, thankfully, and they went ahead with last night's targeted [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  attack and reportedly keeping Joe out of the loop, wisely so, until the last minute. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=125.56s)]
*  Now, the world simply has no respect for Joe Biden. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=131.72s)]
*  That's why he is the biggest loser. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=135.72s)]
*  Nobody listens to him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=138.0s)]
*  Nobody cares what he has to say. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=139.12s)]
*  Nobody thinks he's even, even knows what day of the week it is. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=141.1s)]
*  And just to keep track, Biden's one word, foreign policy, I guess we can call it the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=144.86s)]
*  Biden doctrine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=149.74s)]
*  The don't doctrine is disregarded by our enemies. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=150.94s)]
*  It is disregarded by our allies. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=154.26s)]
*  And a few weeks ago, both the Houthi rebels, you might recall, they ignored Biden's don't [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=156.58s)]
*  and continue to attack cargo ships. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=162.74s)]
*  And who could forget when Biden told Putin, don't, and then Russia did invade Ukraine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=165.38s)]
*  Joe Biden is batting a thousand. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=171.62s)]
*  Now maybe we need a new Biden bumper sticker that reads, when don't means do, because they [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  keep doing when he says don't. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=179.62s)]
*  Now, here's the elephant in the room. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  The word don't is about as complex as Biden is, you know, capable of getting to. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=183.74s)]
*  Now, here he is today, struggling to just get basic simple words out. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=189.66s)]
*  The typical mumbling, bumbling, stumbling that's gotten worse all week. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=194.26s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=198.54s)]
*  Appropriations look for the cheapest labor in the world, sent the jobs, sent the product [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=199.54s)]
*  to those, sent the jobs to those laborers, whether they're in Asia or Europe or wherever [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  they were. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  And then they sent the product back home. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=212.26s)]
*  Well, instead of importing foreign products, I'm exporting their products. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=214.14s)]
*  on the world stage. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=220.98s)]
*  Israel, they are standing up to radical Islamic terrorists that attack them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  They are standing up to their biggest foe. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=228.1s)]
*  And that brings us to the next loser. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=230.92s)]
*  And that would be the Islamic Republic of Iran and the mullahs of Iran, this country's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  radical regime. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=237.76s)]
*  They usually hide behind their proxies. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=239.28s)]
*  In other words, they use foreign terror groups, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels as pawns [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=241.7s)]
*  to do their dirty work. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  Last weekend, the mullahs finally mustered up a little bit of courage. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=249.82s)]
*  They felt emboldened because Joe Biden's the president and he's been trying to appease [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=253.44s)]
*  them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  And they attacked Israel directly. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  Now that resulted in utter and complete humiliation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=260.18s)]
*  If you recall on Saturday, Iran launched more than 300 of their most sophisticated missiles [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=263.46s)]
*  and drones towards Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=269.44s)]
*  99% of the projectiles were shot down. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=271.62s)]
*  Most, by the way, before they were even able to enter Israeli airspace. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  The United States and Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, they all helped defend Israel, shooting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  down Iran's missiles and drones. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=285.98s)]
*  But during last night's targeted Israeli strike against Iran, yeah, nobody came to Iran's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=288.70000000000005s)]
*  defense. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=295.22s)]
*  And with just three missiles, Israel was able to send shivers down the spine of the radical [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=296.22s)]
*  Islamists in charge of Iran. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=302.76s)]
*  And now it's time to finish the job. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=305.12s)]
*  Now the world should come together and take out Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=307.72s)]
*  A lot of people have been saying, military expert after military expert, oh, that's going [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=312.12s)]
*  to be the most difficult task of all to take out their country's nuclear sites because [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=316.76s)]
*  they're spread all around the country and they're buried deep in the ground. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=322.36s)]
*  Look how deep Israel was able to penetrate into Iranian territory. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=326.42s)]
*  But if you take out those nuclear sites, well, guess what? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=332.02s)]
*  That would be a big sigh of relief for the entire world. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=335.46s)]
*  The next thing, you want to cut off the country's finances, take out their oil refineries, squeeze [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  the regime and return to the peace through strength policies that the world enjoyed during [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  the previous president under Donald Trump. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  Iran had no money, their proxies were weakened, its reign of terror was held in check, Soleimani [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=354.02s)]
*  is dead. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=359.58s)]
*  Biden then came into office, gave them billions and billions, turned a blind eye to them selling [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=360.94s)]
*  oil on the world stage. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=365.54s)]
*  They waived sanctions so billions of dollars from Iraq could flow into their coffers. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=367.88s)]
*  They stopped enforcing sanctions. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=372.56s)]
*  And then, of course, they wanted to restart the ridiculous nuclear deal that began in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=374.82s)]
*  the Obama-Biden administration. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  Now the results, they speak for themselves. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=382.06s)]
*  And by the way, let's not forget, Biden threw Israel, our closest ally in the Middle East, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=384.38s)]
*  under the bus. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=390.14s)]
*  Now that brings us to our next loser. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=391.56s)]
*  And that would be Joe Biden's radical base right here in this country. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=394.12s)]
*  Biden publicly has trashed Israel in their time of need, abandoned them, stabbed them [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=398.06s)]
*  in the back, twisted that knife, all in an effort to win back votes from far-left extremists [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=403.68s)]
*  that really are in charge of his party. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=410.32s)]
*  These are people, many of whom, many, not all, that hate America, capitalism and Israel, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=413.06s)]
*  that regularly defend Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=418.90000000000003s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=423.44s)]
*  Thirteen Democrats, they refuse to comply and simply condemn Iran's attack on Israel. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=424.94s)]
*  Where is their moral compass? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  Where is their moral clarity? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=435.58000000000004s)]
*  You can't stand up against the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  You're going to support the people that help provide the weaponry and the plotting and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=442.14s)]
*  the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and the Quds forces of the October 7th attack. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=448.18s)]
*  You can't condemn that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=453.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, during protests, we rarely ever see the faces of these radical agitators, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxRW5jiw5s&t=455.46s)]
