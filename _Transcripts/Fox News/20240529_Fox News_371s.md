# Vivek Ramaswamy: This trial is a win-win for Trump
**Fox News:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI)
*  All right. Now, despite the left's efforts to keep Trump locked in a New York courtroom, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats 2024 hopes they're growing worse by the day. And now, according to this shocking [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=6.88s)]
*  Politico report, privately, many Democrats are in full freakout mode over Joe Biden's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=11.56s)]
*  chances in November. James Carville, again, expressing his frustration with Joe and the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=16.88s)]
*  Democratic Party. Take a look. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=22.52s)]
*  We keep wondering why these young people aren't coming home to the Democrats, which is why [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=24.96s)]
*  blacks are not coming home to the Democrats. Because Democratic messaging is full of ****, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=32.8s)]
*  that's why. And talk about cost of living, and we're going to help deal with this. And [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=39.32s)]
*  don't talk about **** gossip and student loans. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  My friend James Carville got it right. Meanwhile, a recent Biden trip is raising eyebrows after [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=51.84s)]
*  he visited his daughter-in-law's house Sunday night ahead of her expected testimony in Hunter's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=56.88s)]
*  gun crime trial. That's set to begin on June the 3rd, a couple of days away. Earlier today, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  our very own Peter Ducey did ask the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=68.16s)]
*  about the visit. And of course, she had no answers, as per usual. Take a look. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=72.56s)]
*  Why did President Biden have a private meeting with a witness who plans to testify in court [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=77.88s)]
*  against his son? And he visited her as that anniversary is approaching. He visited her [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=83.08s)]
*  days before the anniversary of the passing of his son. And she is family. She was married, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=89.8s)]
*  obviously, to his late son. So they did not talk about her testimony. This was not about that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=96.44s)]
*  This was about literally the ninth anniversary of the passing of his son. That is upcoming in days. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=101.0s)]
*  Forgot the dated Hunter part. Anyway, here with reaction, former 2024 presidential candidate, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=110.12s)]
*  the vague Ramaswami is with us. So, Politico, Dems, full-blown freakout over Biden. Minority [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=115.64s)]
*  voters bolting from Biden could mean a disaster for Democrats. Carville, Democratic messaging is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=122.12s)]
*  full of Adam Schiff's stop ignoring the economy. By the way, then suggesting Democrats steal Trump's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=128.44s)]
*  medical records. He may have secondary syphilis. I didn't know it was Dr. James Carville, but that's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=134.6s)]
*  him. Putting all of that aside, evenâ€”I am convinced, Vivek, and you tell me if I'm wrong, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=140.76s)]
*  regardless of the outcome of this trial, I don't think it has any impact on the election. Thoughts? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=148.76s)]
*  Look, I think it's a win-win for Donald Trump right now, where the American people have seen [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=153.32s)]
*  through the farce that is this trial in Manhattan. It is one of the weakest cases that have ever been [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  brought against a prominent person, and it is a shameful stain on our history that most Americans [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  across the political spectrum understand. So that's the good news, Sean. Here's the bad news. The [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=169.56s)]
*  reason they have set the debate in June 27th, the earliest presidential debate in history, and as far [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=174.12s)]
*  as I know, the first time it's happened before either party's nominating convention, is that I [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=180.52s)]
*  think it is the final trial balloon for Joe Biden. It's their way of having him jump through the final [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=185.24s)]
*  hoop before he earns that nomination. And so the other side, they're diabolical. They're one step [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  ahead on this as they frequently are, where if Joe Biden underperforms there, that's when I expect [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=195.16000000000003s)]
*  they will restart the race, possibly with a new nominee. So we're doing well now, no doubt about [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  it, but complacency is not an option. We can't just worry about the other side. We got to do the best [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  job we can about saying who we are, what we stand for, and showing up in non-traditional locations [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=210.2s)]
*  like the Bronx or the Libertarian Party convention, likely the places where Donald Trump has actually [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  been to demonstrate leadership in leading the entire country. I've said that, you know, Joe Biden [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  is one major fall away from losing that nomination as he continues to deteriorate seemingly rapidly [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=227.32s)]
*  and in an accelerated fashion. I really have begun to believe you may very well be right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=234.6s)]
*  This may be his final test, and I don't know if there's enough red bull to keep him awake or [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  jack him up enough to get through that debate without a teleprompter like he had at the State [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=246.12s)]
*  of the Union. Red bull or worse, I will say, Sean. And here's what I will say. In 2016, you had [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=251.0s)]
*  actually many of those reporters and debate moderators literally showing Hillary Clinton [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=258.52s)]
*  the questions beforehand. But one of the things Donald Trump has done better than Joe Biden is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=262.44s)]
*  he has shown up in front of American audiences, even in the last two weeks, who aren't filled [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=267.08s)]
*  with people who agree with him. That's the best form of debate preparation he possibly could have. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=272.44s)]
*  And as a U.S. president, that's what you want. You want a leader who's willing to actually engage [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=277.24s)]
*  with alternative viewpoints rather than hiding in their White House basement. So you mark my words. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=281.88s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=287.08s)]
*  Regardless of what Joe Biden does, he's going to underperform in that debate. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=287.64s)]
*  Do you think any outcome in this case matters in terms of voters and their ultimate decision making? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  I think either outcome is going to favor President Trump. And here's why. Once that outcome is behind [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  us, people will see in the not guilty case. What are they going to see? This was a sham trial. This [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=306.12s)]
*  is a trial where Alvin Bragg made a commitment to voters saying that he was going to go after [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=311.08s)]
*  Donald Trump. You name the man, I'll show you the crime. That was his mentality. That's exactly what [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=315.79999999999995s)]
*  he did. In the case where he's convicted, nobody in the United States of America could still [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=320.44s)]
*  possibly tell you what exactly was the crime that Donald Trump committed. And if he's being [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=324.76s)]
*  sentenced on that basis, they will see the injustice of that as well. So this has backfired, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=329.48s)]
*  backfired as it should. And thankfully, we will be able to end the weaponization of justice [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=334.68s)]
*  when Trump wins that next term. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=339.48s)]
*  You know, it's amazing. People forget Bill Clinton's approval rating went above 70% [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=341.72s)]
*  after he was impeached. American people don't seem to have a tolerance for politics at this level. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=346.44s)]
*  And this is worse than it's ever been by far. Vivek, thank you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JsyYZxAlI&t=354.68s)]
