# It is 'unbelievable' what we will accomplish under Trump, GOP senator says
**Fox News:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc)
*  More reaction to that really remarkable Hill visit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=0.0s)]
*  Florida Senator Rick Scott, Senator, thank you for joining me tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  You know, we're so familiar with both gentlemen, with Elon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=8.76s)]
*  He had little X, his son, on his shoulders. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=12.64s)]
*  That visit, the nature of their mandate, is in and of itself kind of shocking in the moment [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=16.72s)]
*  of what Americans have wanted. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=25.02s)]
*  And yet, you know, we're adjusting to it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=27.44s)]
*  It's real. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=29.32s)]
*  How did it feel on the Hill? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=30.64s)]
*  And what's your feeling about the nature of this new kind of energy coming in? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=32.46s)]
*  Oh, this is exciting. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=36.68s)]
*  You know, I'm a business guy, and business guys know that you have to constantly look [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=39.44s)]
*  at what things cost. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=44.86s)]
*  So here's what Elon's going to do. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  Vivek's going to do this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=48.96s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to do this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=50.24s)]
*  They're going to say, we have got to have dramatic change. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=51.24s)]
*  If we want to get rid of inflation, if we want to pay down our debt, if we want to get [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=54.92s)]
*  full-time jobs, what do we have to do? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=59.5s)]
*  We have to dramatically, not a little bit, not at the edges, dramatically reduce the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=61.5s)]
*  regulatory state. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=65.86s)]
*  When I ran for governor back in 2010 in Florida, we were losing people and losing jobs. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=67.42s)]
*  I walked in, I ran on the platform to get our state back to work. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=72.06s)]
*  We cut 20 percent of the regulatory environment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=75.38s)]
*  We streamlined the permitting environment, and jobs flourished. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=77.9s)]
*  The same thing's going to happen here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=81.06s)]
*  Everything government can do, with a business guy coming in there with efficiency plans [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=83.62s)]
*  and all these things, business guys are going to come in and they're going to make it better. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  So it's an exciting time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  I'm very appreciative of what Donald Trump did to win this race. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=93.41999999999999s)]
*  He won a big race. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  And bringing in Elon and Vivek, it's unbelievable what we're going to get to accomplish. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=98.22s)]
*  I came to Washington, D.C., to do exactly what we're doing right now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=102.46s)]
*  Well, that has got to be exciting. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  But of course, you would personally know that there are, as I just talked with Monica, intensely [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=107.66s)]
*  vested interests in things not changing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=113.86s)]
*  You know, these are—it's about people losing their jobs, and it's going to be [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=117.22s)]
*  good because, yes, more jobs will be created in the private sector for them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=120.86s)]
*  But this has become a way of life for generations. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=124.82s)]
*  And we know that it's going to be fought. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=129.42s)]
*  Do you imagine—and when it comes to the mood of the Senate in particular, obviously [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=131.74s)]
*  for you, do you see the general embracement of what this means? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=136.78s)]
*  We've seen some Democrats say that they like what's going on, but saying it and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  acting on it is a different thing entirely. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=146.7s)]
*  Well, yeah, the swamp is going to fight it, right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=151.38s)]
*  But here's reality. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=155.42s)]
*  A lot of this can be done just through the executive branch. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=157.26s)]
*  I think just in the Biden's term, the regulatory environment has grown exponentially. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  That all can go away. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=167.18s)]
*  It can all go away by if Trump puts in the right people with a lot of the—what they're [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=168.26000000000002s)]
*  going to do, he puts in the right people who run these agencies, they can get rid of all [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=172.82s)]
*  that regulatory environment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=175.74s)]
*  That, in streamlining the permit, will actually do more to create jobs, build our economy, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=177.1s)]
*  than anything else we can do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=183.02s)]
*  Now, we have to, in Congress, we have to get rid of the waste. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=184.74s)]
*  We've had a 2 percent increase in our population in five years and over a 50 percent increase [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=188.3s)]
*  in spending. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=192.9s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=193.9s)]
*  So we're going to have to go through the budget and say what's good and what's bad. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, what I've heard a lot from people, Senator Rick Scott, that has bothered them [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=199.54s)]
*  is what, as an example, Biden just did. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=204.9s)]
*  It seems that he's set up some kind of agreement or contract for people who work at home to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=208.38s)]
*  be able to do that for at least five more years. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  Is that something that can be reversed by the new Senate or by Congress in general? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=218.34s)]
*  We were looking at this and they're trying to hamstring all these things that the president's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=224.85999999999999s)]
*  going to want to do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=230.34s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to fix that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=233.94s)]
*  But just stop and think about this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  OK? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  The American public, you go to work at a grocery store, you don't get to do, just say, oh, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=238.45999999999998s)]
*  I don't want to come in for five years. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=242.18s)]
*  If you have most of the jobs outside government, you have to be there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes, you do. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=248.26s)]
*  It's so unfair to the American public. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=249.26s)]
*  It's so unfair. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=251.94s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=252.94s)]
*  We pay for this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=254.1s)]
*  We pay our taxes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=255.74s)]
*  It's unfair to them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=257.38s)]
*  So we're going to figure out how to fix this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=258.38s)]
*  Good. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=260.14s)]
*  It's almost like another— [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=261.14s)]
*  Come to it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=262.14s)]
*  If you want to get paid, you've got to go to work. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=263.14s)]
*  It's such a strange thing to have to say that, but it is like kind of a redistribution [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=264.14s)]
*  of wealth. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=268.18s)]
*  It's unsustainable. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=269.18s)]
*  So there's obviously a lot of things that are going to have to get done in these first [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=270.64s)]
*  two years. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=274.18s)]
*  Senator Rick Scott, thank you very much, sir, for joining me. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=275.18s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iqoBGJloc&t=276.78s)]
