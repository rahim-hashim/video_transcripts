# Sen. Kennedy: Biden is 'running out of toes to shoot off'
**Fox News:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04)
*  All right, so never missing an opportunity to play identity politics, the left continues [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=0.0s)]
*  to blame racism for former Harvard president Claudine Gay's resignation. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Earlier today, the Reverend Al Sharpton led his group, the National Action Network, in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=9.52s)]
*  a protest outside a billionaire Harvard alumniâ€”alum Bill Ackman's office to show, quote, that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=14.36s)]
*  his attacks on DEI President Gay and black Americans have consequences. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=21.16s)]
*  Ackman, well, he responded on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, offering to meet [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=26.0s)]
*  with the Reverend Al Sharpton regarding his concerns. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=32.04s)]
*  Anyway, there's only one person I wanted for a reaction to all of this, and that's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=34.6s)]
*  Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Senator, you've seen the exchange with these three presidents of these three big colleges [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=41.76s)]
*  and Elise Stefanik. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=47.96s)]
*  We've all seen the tape. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=48.96s)]
*  Their answers were appalling, shocking and, frankly, repulsive. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=51.08s)]
*  I don't know why it took also charges of plagiarism for Claudine Gay to go, but I just [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=57.28s)]
*  want your reaction. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=63.56s)]
*  Dr. Gay, of course, has resigned. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=65.56s)]
*  She should have. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=71.38s)]
*  I bear her no ill will. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  My advice to her, for what it's worth, is that when one door closes, sometimes you need [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=78.24s)]
*  to get a hammer and some nails and make sure that SOB stays shut, because Dr. Gay had [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=85.22s)]
*  no business running a university. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  The plagiarism allegations against her, serious. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=97.52s)]
*  I think most Americans found repugnant her suggestion, express or implied, that it might [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=100.84s)]
*  be okay to kill Jewish people in the proper context. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=109.4s)]
*  My biggest quarrel with Dr. Gay is that she does not understand the purpose of the university. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  The purpose of the university is to make young people think, not to make them comfortable. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=120.2s)]
*  The discussion of ideas should not be closed off. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=127.24s)]
*  There's not only one point of view. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  If you want to believe that math is racist and merit is privilege, or that men can breastfeed, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=135.76s)]
*  this is America, you're entitled to believe that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=145.14s)]
*  But other students who disagree should feel free to disagree. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=147.9s)]
*  The truth is that every advancement, every single one, in art, science, philosophy, technology, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=152.6s)]
*  cooking, golf, came when someone challenged the rules, challenged dogma, and said there's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  a better way. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=171.28s)]
*  That's what our university should encourage instead of just one point of view, which I [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  think Dr. Gay was guilty of. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=178.18s)]
*  We all know how conservatives are treated on college campuses around the country. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=180.92s)]
*  Diversity, equity, and inclusion, DEI as they call it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=185.04s)]
*  What is your reaction to that? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=189.61999999999998s)]
*  Well, let me answer by responding to Reverend Sharpton. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=191.44s)]
*  I've read his comments. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  And he of course is entitled to his opinion, his mind. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=199.27999999999997s)]
*  America is not perfect, but we are good. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=203.88s)]
*  Like every other civilization, America caught the disease of slavery, but we beat it back. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=207.16s)]
*  And we're proud of that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  And since then, we passed civil rights laws in 1866, 1871, 1875, 1960, 1964, 1968, 1990, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=216.7s)]
*  1991. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=231.92s)]
*  We made a lot of racial progress in this country. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=233.6s)]
*  And I think we've reached the point where most, not all, but most Americans don't think [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=236.1s)]
*  about that much about race. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=240.66s)]
*  They think about character. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=242.62s)]
*  They understand, as I've said before, that to a bear, we all taste like chicken. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  Now, I don't believe race should be used to harm a person or to help a person. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=249.62s)]
*  And I think most Americans believe that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=255.9s)]
*  I don't think Reverend Sharpton would agree with me. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=257.86s)]
*  I think he believes that to disregard race is racist. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=261.1s)]
*  And that to me is unconstitutional and morally wrong, but he's entitled to his point of view. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=266.94s)]
*  How is it that Joe Biden seems to have gotten away with, and this happened in the lead-up [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=274.5s)]
*  to the 2020 campaign, and that is that he partnered with a former Ku Klux Klansman by [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=280.5s)]
*  the name of Robert Byrd and fought against the integration of public schools? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=286.62s)]
*  It was his words, not mine, that he didn't want public schools to become racial jungles. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=291.38s)]
*  How is it that a Democratic party, you know they would go after any conservative that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=297.0s)]
*  held that position and fought for that position? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  How come Joe Biden got a pass? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think most members of the media, not all, but most members of the media have tried [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=309.34s)]
*  to help President Biden as much as they can. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=316.94s)]
*  I know with many members of the media in my state that's been the case. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=320.85999999999996s)]
*  But as I said the other day, the American people are not stupid, but they think that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=326.46s)]
*  Joe Biden is, and there's a lot of evidence for that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  He's running out of toes to shoot off. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=338.06s)]
*  The border is exhibit A. And as I've also said on your show before, the American people, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=341.18s)]
*  they're busy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=349.06s)]
*  They don't have time to read Socrates every day. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=350.06s)]
*  They're busy earning a living. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=352.22s)]
*  But sooner or later they figure it out, and they have figured it out with respect to President [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=354.2s)]
*  Biden, his friends in the media notwithstanding. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=359.54s)]
*  And I think he's going to have a rough election cycle. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=364.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=367.5s)]
*  I think it's going to be a roller coaster of a year, probably unprecedented, unlike [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=368.0s)]
*  any we've seen in our lifetime. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=372.82s)]
*  That is maybe the one certainty we can talk about at this point. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=374.85999999999996s)]
*  Senator Kennedy, happy New Year. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=379.38s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=380.78s)]
*  Thanks for being back with us. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrrh0Vh2v04&t=381.78s)]
