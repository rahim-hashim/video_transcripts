# Kudlow: We have a major problem
**Fox News:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw)
*  Here with reaction is Fox Business host, our friend Larry Kudlow, is back on the show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=0.0s)]
*  Larry, good to see you, my friend. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=4.96s)]
*  Oh, this is just something that happens these days. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And would you consider adopting an unvetted, illegal immigrant family? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=9.48s)]
*  I think I'd feel better if they were vetted, and we know they don't have radical associations, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=14.44s)]
*  and at least know something about them before they ever came in the country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=19.48s)]
*  And I'd prefer that they respect our laws, our borders, our sovereignty. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  But this is just something that happens. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=27.92s)]
*  We beat the hell out of cops in Times Square. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=29.44s)]
*  They get let out, no bail laws. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  They flip the bird to New York on their way to the sanctuary state of California for free [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=33.96s)]
*  healthcare. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=38.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=39.08s)]
*  Are we that dumb a country? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=40.08s)]
*  Well thanks for having me, Sean. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=44.0s)]
*  You know, President Trump put it very well tonight in his town hall with Laura Ingraham. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=45.52s)]
*  He called it migrant crime. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=51.88s)]
*  And all the examples you're given, you know, going after cops on the street, going after [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=56.36s)]
*  cops and people in shelters, going after prisons, they're actually worse in the main than [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=61.0s)]
*  our homegrown criminals. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=66.76s)]
*  That's what Trump said tonight, and I think he makes a great point. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=68.0s)]
*  Migrant crime. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Now, if Joe Biden had stayed at the beach and just let the wall be built and remain [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=72.76s)]
*  in Mexico and catch and deport, we wouldn't have this problem. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=79.44s)]
*  But Biden had to overturn all of the Trump policies, which were working very well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=84.16s)]
*  So now we're stuck with migrant crime, people coming all over the world. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=89.88s)]
*  I mean, Griff Jenkins was talking to me on the show tonight, Bill Maluga, Asia, China, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=94.44s)]
*  Kazakhstan, India. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=101.44s)]
*  And it's crazy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=102.44s)]
*  And they're not the best of the best. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=104.48s)]
*  We're not getting there elites. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=106.12s)]
*  We're getting spies. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=108.0s)]
*  We're getting criminals. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=109.52s)]
*  We're getting terrorists. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  We're giving them green cards. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=112.24s)]
*  We're giving them work permits. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=114.28s)]
*  Another thing Griff Jenkins showed me, they actually have you love this from the Trump [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=116.32s)]
*  days, they get remain in Mexico cards. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=121.55999999999999s)]
*  They have them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  But you know what happens as they come over the border, they drop the cards because they [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  don't want the border officials to see them because they want entry into the United States. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's actually there in spades. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=135.28s)]
*  It's an amazing story. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=137.48s)]
*  And one last point, one last point. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=139.04s)]
*  Governor Abbott in Texas is right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=141.32s)]
*  You put up barriers, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=143.92s)]
*  Chicken wire, whatever. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  I would say a wall. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  But all he did was put up chicken wire and the numbers have come way down. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  And so now the crisis has moved kind of from Texas to San Diego, all right, which is where [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  Malugan was reporting from tonight. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=159.44s)]
*  But did barriers work? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=161.64s)]
*  Wire works. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=163.72s)]
*  Walls work. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=164.72s)]
*  What doesn't work is Joe Biden doesn't want to do it and he's going to probably [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=166.04s)]
*  sign an executive order soon before the State of the Union that is going to make this story [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=170.92s)]
*  even worse. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=176.08s)]
*  You wait and see. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=177.08s)]
*  Republicans — and this goes back to our last segment a little bit. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=180.0s)]
*  If they would hold strong, remain in Mexico has to come back. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=183.36s)]
*  Building the border wall that Trump started, finish the wall. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=187.6s)]
*  If you get those things done — and it was razor wire that you're talking about at Eagle's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=191.44s)]
*  Pass in Texas with Governor Abbott. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  And then one other thing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=197.68s)]
*  If we're going to help countries out against real evil and injustices, we're going to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=199.12s)]
*  do that, why can't it be alone? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  When Donald Trump talked about that Iraq, they should pay us back in oil, I thought [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=207.88s)]
*  that was a great idea. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=214.08s)]
*  America cannot afford to be fighting proxy wars. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=215.84s)]
*  And you know the numbers better than anybody, Larry, especially with $34 trillion in debt. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  I fear what happens when we have a trillion dollars a year in debt payment alone. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=225.56s)]
*  I mean, before we spend one dime on Social Security, Medicare, defense, that scares me. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, the latest Biden baseline on the budget from the CBO, Sean, will be at $48 trillion [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=237.88s)]
*  of publicly held debt, or nearly 120 percent of GDP. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=247.56s)]
*  That number, by the way, was 48 percent of GDP just a few years ago before Biden took [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=254.04s)]
*  office. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  So yeah, we have a major problem. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=260.28s)]
*  I mean, let's come back to New York. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=262.36s)]
*  Eric Adams, who says, you know, what stuff happens — I mean, that's the silliest [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=264.68s)]
*  thing I've ever seen, that news conference you played. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  He's going to give them debit cards, okay, which in the New York Post today, Nicole Julien [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=271.32s)]
*  has estimated, will cost about $2.5 billion in the next couple of years. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  Debit cards, Sean, it's like, come over. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=283.24s)]
*  We're going to incentivize you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=286.44s)]
*  We're going to give you money so you can exist here, whether you break the laws or not, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=288.2s)]
*  whether you break the border laws or whether you come here and rob stores, go after cops, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=292.92s)]
*  go after prisons, go after shelters. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=298.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=301.16s)]
*  We're going to help you out. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=302.2s)]
*  This is nuts. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=303.64s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=305.0s)]
*  And that's why this has become such a big national political issue. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=306.6s)]
*  And I will say this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=310.52s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=311.72s)]
*  You're going to need a tough guy, Trump tough, to stop this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=312.68s)]
*  Now, you know, Larry, you're not showing enough compassion. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=318.92s)]
*  These incidents of attacking cops and beating them up in Times Square, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=322.36s)]
*  that's just something that happens these days. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=326.2s)]
*  You've got to get with it a little bit more. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=328.52s)]
*  These are different times we're living in. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=330.28s)]
*  More insanity. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=332.52s)]
*  We'll give you a debit card, Sean. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=334.04s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=336.04s)]
*  Give you a debit card. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=336.84s)]
*  Fox News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx39ctr7lGw&t=342.44s)]
