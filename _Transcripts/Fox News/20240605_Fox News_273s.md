# Ted Cruz: Biden thinks the voters are stupid
**Fox News:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk)
*  Senator Ted Cruz joins me now. So Senator, I have this stupid executive order right here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=0.0s)]
*  You can still come in, even if Biden shuts down the border, say you're scared and Biden [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=4.8s)]
*  facts tracks you into New York City for asylum. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=9.76s)]
*  Yeah, look, this thing is utterly fake. It's a joke. Biden knows it's a joke. Now I will [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  say what's notable. He finally admitted today that he could have done something about this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=19.0s)]
*  from the very beginning. He could have issued this order in 2021. He could have issued this [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=24.2s)]
*  order in 2022. He could have issued this order in 2023. He could have issued it last month [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=28.4s)]
*  or the month before the month before. And he didn't. He didn't. He didn't. Why? Because [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=33.0s)]
*  he wants the 11 million illegals who have invaded this country. This is the outcome [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=37.2s)]
*  they want. They see them all as future Democrat voters. And so if people have to die, if people [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=41.96s)]
*  have to be murdered, if Lakin Riley has to die, Joe Biden and the Democrats are okay [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=47.8s)]
*  with it. If the two NYPD officers shot this week by a Venezuelan illegal immigrant who [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=53.72s)]
*  was captured, we had him in Eagle Pass, Texas, and what did Joe Biden do? He let him go. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  And that Venezuelan went to New York and shot two cops. That's happening every week. And [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=66.12s)]
*  this has nothing to do with securing the border. This is all about the election in five months [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  and this is political camouflage. Joe Biden wants to say, I solved the problem and it's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=76.18s)]
*  all a prop. He thinks the voters are stupid and they're going to ignore the last three [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=81.66s)]
*  and a half years. Well, you heard Mayorca say that the administration's taken it to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=86.2s)]
*  the cartels with unprecedented strength. I mean, you're down in Texas, Senator. Have [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  you witnessed that? Well, actually he's inadvertently correct. The only time Mayorca's or Biden [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=95.0s)]
*  tell the truth is when they do it accidentally. Unprecedented strength. Let me give you two [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=102.32s)]
*  stats from the New York Times. The Mexican drug cartels in 2018 made roughly $500 million [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  from human trafficking. $500 million is a lot of money. Last year the Mexican drug cartels [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  made over $13 billion from human trafficking. That's a 2,600% increase. So he's right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  He's taken the cash to the cartels with unprecedented force. He's made them the most powerful forces [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=128.32s)]
*  in Mexico. And not only is he destroying America, he's also destroying Mexico. Look, in Texas, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=134.78s)]
*  Mexico is our neighbor. Mexico is a wonderful, beautiful country and the cartels are now [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  terrorizing the people of Mexico. They are murdering people. They are kidnapping people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  He has turned them into multi-billion dollar global criminal conspiracies who are smuggling [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=151.26s)]
*  criminals and terrorists into America. He's going to blame you. He's going to blame Trump [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  at the debate. He's going to say you didn't want this bipartisan deal. You guys buried [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  it. I had a solution. You walked away because of politics. What's Trump and what are the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  Republicans going to say? Look, there wasn't a bipartisan deal. There was a Chuck Schumer [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=174.04s)]
*  deal that was a terrible, terrible deal. The Chuck Schumer deal would have made the problem [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=180.44s)]
*  worse. The Chuck Schumer deal put in the law catch and release. It codified it. The Chuck [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=186.2s)]
*  Schumer deal gave work permits to illegal immigrants when they arrived here. The Chuck [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=190.98s)]
*  Schumer deal gave taxpayer funded lawyers to illegal immigrants when they got here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  The Chuck Schumer deal normalized roughly two million illegal immigrants a year, every [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=201.06s)]
*  year in perpetuity. It was a terrible, terrible deal. And the reason is Chuck Schumer doesn't [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=206.92s)]
*  want to secure the border. Joe Biden doesn't want to secure the border. The Democrats don't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=212.92s)]
*  want to secure the border. They want this invasion. The whole purpose of the Chuck Schumer [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=218.04s)]
*  deal was for every Democrat running for reelection to say, see, we had a deal that would have [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=223.36s)]
*  fixed it, but the mean old Republicans wouldn't agree to it. And that's what Joe Biden is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=228.04s)]
*  doing now. Now, I will make a prediction, Jesse. In the next few months, we're going [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=234.0s)]
*  to see the numbers drop down a little bit. And this is just like what Biden did with [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=238.24s)]
*  gas prices. They're trying to fool the voters into ignoring his disastrous record. He wants [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=244.2s)]
*  this invasion and so does every other Democrat. Yeah, it's a numbers game. They do it with [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=251.26s)]
*  inflation. They do it with the jobs reports. They do it all the time. We're not going to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=255.14s)]
*  be fooled by it. Senator Ted Cruz, Texas, thanks as always. Thanks, Jesse. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB2ew2aLWhk&t=258.62s)]
