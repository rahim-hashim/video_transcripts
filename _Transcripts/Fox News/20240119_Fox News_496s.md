# Hannity asks Vivek about possible role in a Trump admin: 'I'm all in for the country'
**Fox News:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis)
*  My next guest, a political outsider, burst onto the scene last year with a plan to splash [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=0.0s)]
*  — slash, rather — the federal bureaucracy, drain the swamp. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=5.84s)]
*  Now he's endorsed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=10.64s)]
*  Donald Trump, a president, joining us now with more. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=11.64s)]
*  Former 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=14.4s)]
*  You know, last time you were on this show, you got pretty pissed off at me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=17.68s)]
*  Are you still mad at me, or are we back being friends again? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=21.64s)]
*  We buried that hatchet, Sean. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  And I think it's a good thing in our movement for us to be able to disagree respectfully [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=26.92s)]
*  and have good debate. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=31.16s)]
*  And I think that's what we had last time. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  So I hope that goes both ways. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Oh, I think you — I actually think — yeah, I think you thrive on it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  I haven't watched you in this campaign. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=37.08s)]
*  I think you thrive on it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=38.96s)]
*  You live for it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=40.36s)]
*  You get energized by it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=41.66s)]
*  I think that's your personality. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=42.96s)]
*  You got out of the race after Iowa. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  You've now appeared on stage with Donald Trump. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  And let's get a little heated between both of you also at the end of that campaign. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=53.28s)]
*  You don't think that either Nikki Haley or Governor DeSantis should stay in. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=59.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=64.0s)]
*  Look, at this point, I think it was fair to run this all the way through Iowa, but the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=65.0s)]
*  people spoke loudly and decisively. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=70.24s)]
*  And I do see an opportunity here, Sean. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=73.68s)]
*  I know a lot of people might laugh at this idea. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  But I see an opportunity to reunite the country, and that starts with reuniting our Republican [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  party. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=82.56s)]
*  So running it through Iowa was fair game. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=83.56s)]
*  I got about 8 percent support. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=85.0s)]
*  I think I was about to get something similar in New Hampshire. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=86.56s)]
*  I think it was better to give Trump a decisive victory, and I would ask for everybody who [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=89.0s)]
*  was considering supporting me in New Hampshire, libertarians included, to go in Trump's direction [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=92.4s)]
*  end of this primary. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=98.0s)]
*  And then let's focus on taking the America First agenda to the next level. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=99.6s)]
*  And I think we're going to do that best by actually first reuniting our party, then reuniting [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=103.44s)]
*  this country. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  And I do think that Donald Trump — you know, I'm clearly — this is why I endorsed him, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  but I do think he is the best choice left in this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=112.08s)]
*  I think it needs to be an America First president. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  I think the America First movement reaches beyond the traditional boundaries of the Republican [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=116.92s)]
*  party. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=120.88s)]
*  So I'm focused on bringing the next generation along with us, for my part, Sean. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=121.88s)]
*  We have a lot of people, young people, who are looking for direction. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=124.96s)]
*  I think it's a powerful message. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=127.96s)]
*  And we can bring them. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=128.96s)]
*  I think certainly after New Hampshire on Tuesday, certainly after South Carolina, I think there's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=129.96s)]
*  a lot on the line for Nikki Haley in both those states. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=134.64s)]
*  Donald Trump, if the polls hold and he wins New Hampshire and he's leading by a significant [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  amount in South Carolina, I'm not sure what her path would be towards the nomination. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=144.44s)]
*  The earlier the Republicans unite, I think the better. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't like New Hampshire's system with an open primary where Democrats can change [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=153.48s)]
*  their party affiliation up to pretty much the last minute and then, you know, wreak [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=158.76s)]
*  havoc in a Republican primary. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  That's been happening. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  Thousands of Democrats have re-registered as either independents or as Republicans, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=166.76s)]
*  just so they can vote in a Republican primary. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=172.44s)]
*  That concerns me a little bit. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=174.96s)]
*  Your thoughts on that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=176.56s)]
*  Well, one thing is I think we should stand against all forms of election interference [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=177.96s)]
*  in the GOP primary, Sean. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=182.54s)]
*  So whether that's Maine or Colorado, one of the things that I said was that I would [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=184.12s)]
*  voluntarily have removed myself from the ballots in Maine and Colorado if they forcibly remove [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=187.8s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=193.48s)]
*  And the right answer for both Haley and DeSantis would have been to say the same thing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=194.48s)]
*  Anytime there's outside election interference from the other side in a GOP primary, I think [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  we should be united in standing against it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  And the fact that we're not, I think, represents a bit of a problem. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=205.72s)]
*  And so for a lot of reasons, I think after New Hampshire, I would say even before New [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=208.2s)]
*  Hampshire, the right step is for Haley-DeSantis to drop out, let's unite behind Donald Trump, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=211.88s)]
*  and then make this not just a Republican party's movement, make an America First movement [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  that is bigger than one man and bigger than one party, bringing the next generation along [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  with us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=225.8s)]
*  And the earlier that starts this year, the better that is going to be for our movement [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=226.8s)]
*  and our country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=230.56s)]
*  And that's where I stand. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=231.56s)]
*  The agenda is simple. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=232.56s)]
*  You control the borders. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=233.56s)]
*  We become energy dominant, not just independent, but dominant. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=234.76s)]
*  We sell these resources. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=239.04s)]
*  Then we can cut taxes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=241.04s)]
*  Then we can start paying down the $40 trillion in debt. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=242.52s)]
*  And in terms of foreign policy, I agree with a lot of your points. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=245.84s)]
*  I don't want Americans involved in endless wars. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=249.76s)]
*  I feel Joe Biden has just botched the whole Ukraine effort by putting handcuffs from the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=252.84s)]
*  beginning on Zelensky. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=259.52s)]
*  I do want to see Israel win their war against terror, because the Islamic radical terrorists [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=261.04s)]
*  that attacked them on October 7th want to attack us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=267.6s)]
*  I think the world has to, at some point, deal with Iran. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's where I wanted to specifically ask you, what do you do with the number one [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=275.06s)]
*  state sponsor of terror? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=278.8s)]
*  There wouldn't be Houthi rebels armed as well as they are without the Iranians. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=280.58000000000004s)]
*  The same with Hamas, the same with Hezbollah, the same with a lot of these groups. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  A lot of this goes right to the mullahs in Iran. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=290.5s)]
*  Should the world unite and make sure that they never get nuclear weapons, and should [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=294.14s)]
*  they take out their refineries, which is their ability to make money to foment terror? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=298.3s)]
*  So I'll say three things there, Sean. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=303.02s)]
*  First on the point on Israel. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=305.54s)]
*  Israel is now proving it is able to get its job done. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=306.94s)]
*  The number one thing we need to do is provide the diplomatic support that allows them to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=309.7s)]
*  get their job done without having to actually be half in, half out, which I think is worse [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=313.34s)]
*  for Israel and worse for the United States. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=317.7s)]
*  And you have Biden now second-guessing their decisions. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=320.14s)]
*  They don't need a backseat quarterback or an armchair quarterback. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=322.82s)]
*  That's not what they need. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=325.8s)]
*  And so as we now move to the Houthis, what I would say is my rule of thumb when it comes [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=326.8s)]
*  to foreign policy is if you hit us, whichever group it is that hits us, we hit you back [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=330.64s)]
*  ten times harder. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  That has to be the rule. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=336.28s)]
*  It's what I would tell my son if he's being bullied in school. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=337.28s)]
*  It's the same principle in human nature as in foreign policy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=339.74s)]
*  If somebody hits you, hit that group back ten times harder. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=342.62s)]
*  Is it in the world's interest and the U.S.'s interest to make sure Iran never becomes [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=345.84s)]
*  nuclear-equipped? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=349.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=350.12s)]
*  And I think whether it's Saudi Arabia or Iran, we should make sure that we stop nuclear proliferation [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=351.5s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=356.8s)]
*  I do think it was a mistake for the U.S. to engage in discussions about nuclear technology [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=357.94s)]
*  transfer to Saudi Arabia last year. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=362.18s)]
*  That's something that was under-discussed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=364.58s)]
*  But keeping nukes out of Iran's hands, absolutely a vital priority. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=366.34s)]
*  Where I am different than the Lindsey Grahams or others in the Republican Party is I don't [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=370.14s)]
*  believe a preemptive strike on Iran is a good idea. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=373.36s)]
*  To the contrary, I think we can deal with, I think, a lot of these threats diplomatically [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=376.56s)]
*  through smart use of our economic fortitude become, as you said, energy-dominant. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=380.94s)]
*  Again, we need to become a net exporter of energy, which takes the legs out of leverage [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  from our enemies on the global stage. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=389.74s)]
*  That's the right focus. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=391.82s)]
*  And so that's where America first policy— [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=393.3s)]
*  I'm not sure that's going to work, though. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=394.3s)]
*  I think is the right way forward. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=395.3s)]
*  There are reports that Iran could be just a month, two months, three months away from [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=396.86s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=400.86s)]
*  And marrying that to their radical ideology and their fomenting of terror, they would [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=402.26s)]
*  be the people that would do it, in my view. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  Scary scenario. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=411.1s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=412.22s)]
*  As a reporter, President Trump, the president has talked about you maybe joining his administration [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=413.3s)]
*  if he's elected, any particular job that you would want. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=417.94000000000005s)]
*  So, Sean, the truth is I'm in this for the country. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=422.74s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to drive change in this country, inside and outside government. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=426.62s)]
*  For the last few years, I've been doing it through the market. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=430.42s)]
*  I started to strive to compete directly against BlackRock and State Street and Vanguard. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=433.22s)]
*  That's what I was doing for the couple of years before I ran for U.S. president for [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=438.3s)]
*  the year running into it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=441.18s)]
*  And so I'm all in for the country. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=442.74s)]
*  And right now, my focus is making sure that we do elect Donald Trump as the next president [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=444.62s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=448.26s)]
*  It's not even about me. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=449.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not about Trump. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not about one man. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=451.53999999999996s)]
*  It's about this country. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  So that's what I'm most focused on. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  And whatever it is for the country, I'm all in to do the right thing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=454.98s)]
*  Well, listen, you've got to get a lot of credit. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=457.58s)]
*  You ran hard. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=459.9s)]
*  You came out of nowhere. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=461.02s)]
*  You got a lot of attention. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=463.14s)]
*  You made a lot of people mad, which was interesting to me. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=464.7s)]
*  And I can sense that your passion is real. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=468.78s)]
*  I don't think you can fake that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=472.1s)]
*  And it'll be interesting to see what your future is in the world of politics. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=474.26s)]
*  Obviously, you're very young. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=478.34s)]
*  And I'm sure we'll be talking many times in the future. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=480.22s)]
*  We appreciate you being back. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=482.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U32RCPRFis&t=483.98s)]
