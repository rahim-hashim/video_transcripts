# Vice President JD Vance reveals the moment the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting 'went off the rails'
**Fox News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE)
*  Mr. Vice President, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to see you, man. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=1.84s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=2.84s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=3.84s)]
*  Let's go back to the Oval Office, Friday, from your perspective. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=4.84s)]
*  Yeah, great TV, as the President said. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=6.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, it's funny. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=10.16s)]
*  So we have a 40-, 45-minute press conference, and the President normally does this, and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  I've seen this now three or four times with foreign leaders, where he likes to bring the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=16.52s)]
*  media in, likes to have a conversation, but answer questions with the press. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=19.88s)]
*  As you know, he's very open with reporters. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=23.16s)]
*  And what I noticed is that for the first 25, 30 or so minutes, he tried to sort of bend [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=25.52s)]
*  over backwards to be gracious and kind to Zelensky. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=30.32s)]
*  Even when Zelensky was kind of needling him, even when Zelensky was saying things that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=33.92s)]
*  I thought were untrue, the President just tried to be diplomatic, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=37.8s)]
*  I think that's his natural instinct in that situation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  And then when it really went off the rails, of course, is when I asked—or you had a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=45.4s)]
*  who asked a question, the President answered it, and then I answered it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=51.28s)]
*  And then something about my answer just really set Zelensky off. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=55.6s)]
*  So then he came at me. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=59.0s)]
*  So you blamed yourself. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=60.0s)]
*  And then I went back at him. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=61.0s)]
*  And what I tried to do originally was actually try to diffuse the situation a little bit, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=65.64s)]
*  because I'm like, you know, we're having this meeting, obviously there are 100 television [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=70.04s)]
*  cameras here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=73.6s)]
*  Let's try to have this conversation in private. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=74.88s)]
*  And then the President, as we kept on going back and forth, I tried again to say, well, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=77.52s)]
*  maybe we should have this conversation in private. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=82.84s)]
*  And the President was like, nope, actually, I don't want to have it in private anymore. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  I want to have this actual conversation in public for the American people to see. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  And I do think that there was just a certain sense of—there was a lack of respect. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  There was a certain sense of entitlement. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  And most importantly, look, we can look past all of that stuff, but the President has set [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=98.44s)]
*  a very clear goal for his administration. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  He wants the killing to stop. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=104.72s)]
*  And I think that it's very important that President Zelensky and, of course, President [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=106.48s)]
*  Putin too, they've both got to come to the negotiating table. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=109.44s)]
*  And that's ultimately where things broke apart. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=112.88s)]
*  I really don't care what President Zelensky says about me or anybody else, but he showed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  a clear unwillingness to engage in the peace process that President Trump has said is the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=119.08s)]
*  policy of the American people and of their president. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=124.2s)]
*  That's the real breakdown is I think Zelensky wasn't yet there. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=127.68s)]
*  And I think, frankly, now still isn't there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=130.92s)]
*  But I think he'll get there eventually. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=133.12s)]
*  He has to. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=134.16s)]
*  My understanding is he tried to get back in or tried to stay a number of times and then [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=135.48s)]
*  made numerous calls to come back. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=139.96s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=141.92s)]
*  I don't know about numerous calls, but they certainly made at least one request to come [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=142.92s)]
*  back in and continue the conversation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=147.44s)]
*  The president was like, look, first of all, they were disrespectful. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=149.0s)]
*  And second of all, what are we even going to talk about? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=151.44s)]
*  They've shown a clear unwillingness to discuss the peaceful settlement that President Trump [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=154.04s)]
*  is trying to bring to the situation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=158.56s)]
*  I think a lot of Americans are sort of, you know, it's useful to step back and ask ourselves, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=160.28s)]
*  what is the actual plan here? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  You can't just fund the war forever. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=168.36s)]
*  The American people won't stand for it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, Sean, if you look at European opinion polls, the Europeans aren't going [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  to stand forever for it either. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=175.84s)]
*  We need to bring this thing to a peaceful settlement. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  The president was trying to do that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=180.52s)]
*  He'll continue to try to do that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  But you've got to have to to tango. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=183.84s)]
*  You've got to have a negotiating partner in the Ukrainians who recognize that, you know, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=185.68s)]
*  of course they have their views and of course they're not always going to agree with us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  But they've got to participate in the conversation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  They weren't willing to do that on Friday. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=196.24s)]
*  So the president said, send him home. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  He said today that the war he expects will go on a very long time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=199.12s)]
*  I don't know where he's going to get the money to fund that war. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  I have my doubts that Europe will fund the war to the level that Biden and Harris were [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=205.0s)]
*  funding it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  And then the issue now has come up whether or not this administration will continue to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=210.44s)]
*  offer money and arms for this war to continue. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  Because without America, I would argue the president was right in saying they have no [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=220.0s)]
*  cards. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=223.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=224.0s)]
*  Well, well, Sean, I think our European friends, frankly, are being really, really they're [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  doing a disservice to the Ukrainians because their own populations are saying we're not [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=229.48s)]
*  going to fund this war indefinitely. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  The American people are saying we don't want to fund the war indefinitely. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=235.28s)]
*  So the only thing that is in the best interest of America, of Russia, of Ukraine and of Europe [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=238.6s)]
*  is to bring this thing to a close. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=244.32s)]
*  What happened, Sean, is you have Zelensky, he goes to Europe and a lot of our European [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=246.2s)]
*  friends puff him up. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=250.4s)]
*  They say, you know, you're a freedom fighter. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  You need to keep fighting forever. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=253.28s)]
*  Well, fighting forever with what? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=254.92s)]
*  With whose money, with whose ammunition and with whose lives? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=256.68s)]
*  The president is actually taking a much more realistic perspective and saying this can't [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=260.2s)]
*  go on forever. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=264.64s)]
*  We can't fund this thing forever. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=265.56s)]
*  The Ukrainians can't fight forever. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  So let's bring this thing to a peaceful settlement. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=269.08s)]
*  When I interviewed Zelensky, he wouldn't give me direct answers. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  When I asked him about the mineral deal to pay the U.S. back, to me, there's three phases [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=273.92s)]
*  in this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=279.0s)]
*  And my understanding was Friday was supposed to be relatively ceremonial. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=279.44s)]
*  It was. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=283.44s)]
*  And then that it was supposed to be we signed the mineral deal. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=284.04s)]
*  That's that's part one. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=286.76s)]
*  Part two would be a ceasefire. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=288.0s)]
*  Part three would be the hardest, the hardest part. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=290.24s)]
*  The negotiated settlement with Putin, who, correct me if I'm wrong, said he's willing [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=292.6s)]
*  to talk peace with Trump. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=296.68s)]
*  Yeah, he said he's willing to talk peace. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=298.0s)]
*  And of course, we trust but verify we want to have the conversation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=299.64s)]
*  We don't assume that everything that anybody tells us is true. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=303.12s)]
*  That's why we want to engage in this conversation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  But you're exactly right, Sean. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  When the Ukrainians came to Washington on Friday, it was supposed to be ceremonial. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=311.12s)]
*  You know, there had been some public back and forth, some disagreements, some some words [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=315.36s)]
*  spoken in public. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=319.68s)]
*  And the president was like, let's have this moment. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=321.24s)]
*  We give some credit to the brave Ukrainian fighters. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=323.48s)]
*  And of course, it's a very brave army that they have there in Ukraine. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=325.8s)]
*  Let's sign this minerals deal, which importantly does two things. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=329.08s)]
*  It allows the American people to get some of their money back. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=332.68s)]
*  But it also shows the Ukrainian people that America has a long term investment in their [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  sovereignty. You do those things. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  We'll sign this thing. We'll have a rah rah moment. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  And then we'll get to the tough talk of negotiating peace. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  We couldn't even get the Ukrainians to a point where they could talk about the peaceful [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  settlement. And look, in some way, Sean, I get it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  I get the frustration. I get the rage. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  It's their country. Of course, it's not our country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=357.04s)]
*  But you've got to accept cooler heads have got to prevail. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=359.72s)]
*  This thing cannot go on forever. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=363.36s)]
*  This is the important point. I'd say this to our of course, most importantly, the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=365.88s)]
*  Americans are watching, but people all over the world. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  When you talk to leaders in private, whether they're Ukrainian or European, when you [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=372.92s)]
*  talk to people in private, they will tell you this cannot go on forever. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  There aren't enough Ukrainian lives. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=382.0s)]
*  There isn't enough American money and there isn't enough ammunition to fund this [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=383.92s)]
*  thing indefinitely. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=387.76s)]
*  The only realistic pathway to bringing this thing to a settlement is President Trump's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  pathway. We encourage both President Zelensky and President Putin to follow that path. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=393.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  And this came up in the discussion Friday. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=401.16s)]
*  The Biden administration called Putin every name in the book, and they've been trying [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=403.92s)]
*  to get the president and he's still invaded anyway. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=407.36s)]
*  OK, he's still invaded anyway. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=409.48s)]
*  Remember, it depends if it's a minor incursion. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=411.4s)]
*  Let's let's go back to that moment, which I thought as troops were massing on the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=413.68s)]
*  border. But I go back and I think about this and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=417.52s)]
*  Biden spent all of this money called Putin, all these names, the media and the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  Democrats, they want Donald Trump to call him names and the president address that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  It's the craziest thing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=432.12s)]
*  And then he's supposed to call him and say, Vladimir, are you ready to talk a piece [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=432.56s)]
*  now? That's not going to work. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=436.68s)]
*  No, it's diplomacy 101, right? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  Is you have to have a reasonable relationship with somebody to be able to even start the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  conversation. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  We have to remember, Sean, Ukraine, half of the country, a third of the country is [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=447.24s)]
*  totally destroyed. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=451.32s)]
*  The economy is depressed. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=452.52s)]
*  You've got hundreds of thousands of dead Ukrainians, of course, a lot of dead [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=453.84s)]
*  Russians as well. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=458.04s)]
*  The president wants to negotiate a settlement. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=459.32s)]
*  How can you negotiate if you can't even talk to somebody? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=461.92s)]
*  And that's what he said. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=465.16s)]
*  He's not saying like nobody's suggesting, as Secretary Rubio said, no one is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=466.2s)]
*  suggesting that we give the Nobel Peace Prize to Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=470.64s)]
*  What we're saying is it's important for President Trump to be able to have a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=474.52s)]
*  conversation that's not well served by standing up at a press conference and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=478.28s)]
*  calling the guy every negative name in the book. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=483.56s)]
*  By the way, as you just said, President Biden called Putin every single name in the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  book. What did it lead to? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=490.44s)]
*  It led to war. It led to destruction. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  It led to conflict. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=494.2s)]
*  President Trump is trying to bring this thing to a close. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=495.48s)]
*  You got to be able to talk to somebody to do that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=497.64s)]
*  Is the door open? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=499.64s)]
*  President Trump said Friday he can come back if he wants peace. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=501.12s)]
*  Is that door still open today? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=504.96s)]
*  What President Trump has said clearly and consistently is, of course, the door is [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=506.68s)]
*  open so long as Zelensky is willing to seriously talk peace. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=512.12s)]
*  You can't come into the Oval Office or anywhere else and refuse to even discuss [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  the details of a peace deal. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=521.04s)]
*  Look, this is not going to make anybody happy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=522.68s)]
*  The Russians are going to have to give up stuff. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=525.28s)]
*  The Ukrainians are going to have to give up stuff. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=526.96s)]
*  You can't come to the Oval Office and say, give us security guarantees. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=529.04s)]
*  We won't even engage with you about what we're willing to give up. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=532.68s)]
*  That's been the Ukrainian posture. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  When that posture changes, as President Trump said, when they're willing to talk [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=538.0s)]
*  peace, I think President Trump will be the first person to pick up the phone. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=541.56s)]
*  Well, I've got to imagine that they're probably rethinking it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=544.4s)]
*  What did you make of European leaders, you know, quote, their voices of solidarity [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  this weekend? Because it's Lindsey Graham, who's been very supportive of Ukraine in [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=551.52s)]
*  this conflict. I mean, he was livid. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=556.08s)]
*  And he said, if they want to now defend their own continent, let them go ahead and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=558.76s)]
*  do it. Good luck to them. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=561.84s)]
*  Yeah. And my message to Ukrainians, by the way, to President Zelensky is when you've [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=563.6800000000001s)]
*  lost Lindsey Graham, that means you need to come to the negotiating table and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=567.5600000000001s)]
*  recognize Donald Trump is the only game in town. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=571.24s)]
*  He's the only person who I think has a meaningful plan to save that country. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=574.08s)]
*  But, you know, Sean, here's the problem with the Europeans. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=578.36s)]
*  And a lot of these guys are our friends. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=581.48s)]
*  They're our allies. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=583.24s)]
*  We, of course, you know, the president has a great relationship with a lot of [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=584.96s)]
*  European heads of state, and so do I. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=588.0400000000001s)]
*  But they need to be realistic. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  And the craziest part about this, Sean, is that sometimes you'll have European heads [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=592.9200000000001s)]
*  of state who in public will puff up their chest and say, we're in it with President [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=597.0s)]
*  Zelensky for the next 10 years. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=602.08s)]
*  And then in private, they'll pick up the phone and say, we can't this can't go on [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=603.8000000000001s)]
*  forever. He has to come to the negotiating table. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=607.2s)]
*  So I honestly don't care what the Europeans say in public. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=609.48s)]
*  What I care is what they say in private and what they need to be saying to President [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=612.88s)]
*  Zelensky is this can't go on forever. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  The bloodshed, the killing, the economic devastation, it's making everyone worse [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=619.36s)]
*  off. The only pathway to think back to peace and prosperity is what the president's [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  trying to accomplish. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=629.96s)]
*  And now we look back in time and we see Joe Biden was beginning to understand that the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=630.64s)]
*  patience of the American people is running thin. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  That's right. Hundreds of billions of dollars were a nation with nearly 40 trillion in [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=637.12s)]
*  debt. I mean, it's too much. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=641.16s)]
*  Well, Sean, it's an important point, though, because I was a United States senator for, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=643.0s)]
*  of course, for the last two years, the Biden administration. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  I got elected. I think you like this job better. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  I think I like this job a lot better. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=649.8s)]
*  I certainly like the president a lot better. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=651.4s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=653.4s)]
*  You know, when you would talk to the Biden administration officials in private, it's [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=654.6s)]
*  another example of a terrible situation. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  The Biden admin left the Trump administration when you ask them, what's the plan? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=661.0799999999999s)]
*  OK, we're going to spend tens of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=665.56s)]
*  in Ukraine. What is your plan? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=668.92s)]
*  And they would honestly tell you, well, we're just going to send them weapons for as [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=671.0s)]
*  long as we can and hope eventually they can turn the tide. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=674.64s)]
*  Hope is not a strategy. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=677.7199999999999s)]
*  Throwing money and ammunition at a terrible conflict, that is not a strategy. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  The only guy in town with a strategy is the president of the United States, and everybody [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=684.24s)]
*  needs to follow his lead. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=688.52s)]
*  What scares me is Zelensky when he says it's going to go on for years. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=689.4799999999999s)]
*  How many more lives are going to be lost? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  He's not going to have a country to save it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=695.04s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=696.8s)]
*  The minerals deal would have provided the monies to rebuild their country and a strong [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=697.68s)]
*  U.S. presence and maybe European troops as well. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  And this is this is an important part of it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=705.16s)]
*  The president knows that, look, if you want real security guarantees, if you want to [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=706.7199999999999s)]
*  actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=711.52s)]
*  security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=717.12s)]
*  That is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=722.6800000000001s)]
*  that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=728.36s)]
*  The security guarantee and also the economic guarantee for Ukraine is to rebuild the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=731.32s)]
*  country and ensure that America has a long term interest. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=736.6s)]
*  You're not going to do that if you come to the Oval Office, insult the president and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJS3qQlVjE&t=739.84s)]
