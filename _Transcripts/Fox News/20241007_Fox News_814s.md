# Sean Hannity: Kamala Harris' internal poll numbers have to be horrendous
**Fox News:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI)
*  And welcome to Hannity and a busy news night tonight the Gulf Coast of Florida bracing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=0.0s)]
*  for yet another massive hurricane. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=5.44s)]
*  Now a cat five barreling again towards the Tampa area and the west coast of Florida. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=7.72s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis, he will join us more on the important hurricane prep that is now [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=13.44s)]
*  underway. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=17.6s)]
*  Unlike Kamala and Joe, they actually stage 30,000 utility vehicles and water and food [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=18.6s)]
*  and medicine and supplies, something that Kamala and Joe can learn from. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=26.259999999999998s)]
*  And tonight, Governor DeSantis will respond to Kamala Harris politicizing this hurricane. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=30.34s)]
*  Also, our very own Sarah Carter, she is in the toughest areas hit in North Carolina with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=35.7s)]
*  Hurricane Helene, struggling to recover in North Carolina 11 days after. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=41.34s)]
*  We're going to check in with those victims. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  They do have a message for Kamala and Joe. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=48.96s)]
*  That's straight ahead tonight. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  And also tonight, 97 hostages, including four Americans, remain somewhere in Gaza. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=52.98s)]
*  One year after the October 7th terrorist attack on Israel, it's now a forefront war against [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=60.04s)]
*  Israel, 1200 people brutally murdered by Hamas, others raped and kidnapped and tortured and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  beheaded. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=72.22s)]
*  And by the way, including women and young children, adjusted for population. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=73.22s)]
*  What happened one year ago today, that is the equivalent of 40,000 Americans killed [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  in a single day. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=81.94s)]
*  Will somebody tell Joe and Kamala? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=83.46s)]
*  Anyway, but during one of her famous word salads, Kamala Harris couldn't bring herself [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=85.5s)]
*  to even back the Israeli prime minister, the only democracy in the region, our biggest [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=90.22s)]
*  ally in the region, and his war against radical Islamic terrorists that are still holding [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=95.46s)]
*  Americans hostage. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=101.16s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=103.22s)]
*  Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=104.98s)]
*  I think with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=113.1s)]
*  the American people and the Israeli people? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=120.22s)]
*  And the answer to that question is yes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=122.58s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately, we'll have much more of Kamala's disaster of CBS interviews straight [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=125.18s)]
*  ahead and get this after weeks and weeks and 70 plus days of hiding from even her closest [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=129.94s)]
*  friends in the state run media mob, Kamala Harris, now all of a sudden is going to participate [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=136.02s)]
*  in a number of interviews this week. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=140.9s)]
*  They're all really hard hitting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=142.5s)]
*  Now, every one of these, well, they'll be infomercials, friendly interviews, let's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=144.66s)]
*  see, CBS, oh, the ladies of the view, the sadly, newly, extremely woke Howard Stern, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=149.62s)]
*  the guy that now thinks that every Trump supporter is stupid. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  The only thing that would make you stupid is if you were a Howard Stern fan and you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=160.34s)]
*  still listen to him at this point. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=165.22s)]
*  If he thinks you're stupid, why would you listen to him? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=166.82s)]
*  And a podcast named Call Her Daddy, that's a big one. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=169.66s)]
*  And Stephen Colbert, who loves to kiss her ass. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=173.86s)]
*  Now take a look at your screen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  These outlets are never going to ask, any of these people will never ask the questions [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=178.74s)]
*  about her radical, extreme and frankly dangerous record and her failures in office. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=183.02s)]
*  There will be no real vetting of Kamala, no real questions in any of these appearances, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=188.22s)]
*  none whatsoever. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  I hate Donald Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  I hate Donald Trump more. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=196.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you hate Donald Trump? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I hate Donald Trump. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you hate Donald Trump? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  That's what the interviews will be. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  Make no mistake, there is one huge reason and only one reason that Kamala is now going [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=201.78s)]
*  on and doing any interviews. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  Her internal poll numbers have got to be horrendous. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=211.1s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, the publicly available poll numbers from the most credible pollsters in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=213.7s)]
*  2016 and 2020 in swing states, we've been showing you, they're not great for Kamala [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=219.1s)]
*  Harris. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=224.82s)]
*  She is down in multiple polls in Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=225.82s)]
*  North Carolina and Georgia. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=232.66s)]
*  The race is even tight in Virginia, where Kamala holds a slight lead. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=234.89999999999998s)]
*  A brand new Yahoo News poll shows Trump surging nationwide. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=238.98s)]
*  They have a general election right now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  That's the overall election. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=247.5s)]
*  Not any particular state. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=249.54s)]
*  Tied at 47-47. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=250.7s)]
*  Polymarket, in other words, the betting markets, they track betting odds. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=253.02s)]
*  They had Trump down for weeks and weeks. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=256.82s)]
*  Now Trump is at an all-time high in Pennsylvania and close to an all-time high nationwide. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=259.42s)]
*  His lead is up to 8.6 percent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=264.86s)]
*  Rasmussen found only 34 percent of our country believe the country is headed in the right [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  direction under Harris-Biden. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=272.5s)]
*  It is even lower in a recent NBC poll at 28 percent. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=275.14s)]
*  And now it appears that with just 29 days until Election Day, early voting now in many [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=279.7s)]
*  states going on as a public service, that is available on Hannity.com, at a register, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=285.3s)]
*  when early voting starts and stops. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=291.94s)]
*  Harris is desperately trying to make up ground. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=294.14s)]
*  That's why she's finally doing friendly interviews. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=296.58s)]
*  But you know, lapping it up with Trump hater Howard Stern, those hard-hitting interviewers [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=299.3s)]
*  on The View, and Stephen Colbert, who's dull as dirt, or the Call Me Daddy podcast, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=306.7s)]
*  while millions of Americans are suffering the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=313.14s)]
*  and another major hurricane on the way, is, well, not exactly the best look for the vice [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=318.26s)]
*  president when she and Joe Biden have been completely missing in action. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=323.52s)]
*  In fact, it's downright heartless. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=327.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, do you want to do Call Her Daddy today? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think you and your listeners have really got this— [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=333.12s)]
*  You shouldn't have been there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=338.52s)]
*  None of us should have been there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  —to communicate with people is to be real. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=341.52s)]
*  You know? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=343.52s)]
*  And she was giggling a lot during the podcast. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=347.52s)]
*  We don't know the truth about the death toll in North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=350.92s)]
*  Tennessee, Florida. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=355.32s)]
*  We don't know yet. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, all these Americans have been abandoned. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  She's doing Howard Stern, Colbert, The View, and Call Me Daddy. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, supplies haven't been delivered. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  They're now being delivered by neighbors in Samaritan's Purse, in some cases by horse [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=367.32s)]
*  and by mule. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  Joe is out there just flat-out lying. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden said on Friday, everything that people need, they got everything that they [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=378.24s)]
*  need, and everybody is happy. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=383.24s)]
*  Not true. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=386.14s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=387.14s)]
*  What do the states in the storm zone need, Mr. President? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=388.14s)]
*  What do the states in the storm zone, what do they need, after what you saw today? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=391.14s)]
*  Oh, in the storm zone? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=396.14s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=398.14s)]
*  I'm wondering what storm they're talking about. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=399.14s)]
*  They're getting everything they need. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=402.14s)]
*  And they're very happy across the board. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=404.14s)]
*  They're getting everything they need. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  They're very happy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=410.34000000000003s)]
*  Federal rescue operations have been slow. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  They have been disjointed, nearly nonexistent. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=415.34000000000003s)]
*  According to Biden's DHS secretary, FEMA, he's saying he's out of money after the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  emergency management agency spent a billion of your dollars to feed and house Harris—Biden, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=423.14s)]
*  unvetted illegal immigrants, Border Zahar Kamala Harris, all on board for that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=431.14s)]
*  And meanwhile, the top two stated priorities of FEMA are diversity, equity and inclusion [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=436.24s)]
*  and climate change. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay, I think their priorities are screwed up. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=443.24s)]
*  You would think that the emergency management would be the top of the list in helping every [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=446.64s)]

*  You'd think they would have the money available, especially in light of how much money they [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=452.84s)]
*  give all these other countries, but not under Kamala's so-called leadership. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=456.36s)]
*  And today, Kamala was most focused on trashing Donald Trump and Ronda Santis for daring a [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=460.76s)]
*  criticize the administration's response. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=465.84s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=468.64s)]
*  The other point I'd make is that there's a lot of misinformation being pushed out there [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=469.64s)]
*  by the former president about what is available, in particular to the survivors of the lien. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=475.14s)]
*  And first of all, it's extraordinarily irresponsible. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=482.14s)]
*  It's about him. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=485.14s)]
*  It's not about you. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=486.14s)]
*  And the reality is that FEMA has so many resources that are available to folks who desperately [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=488.14s)]
*  need them. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=494.14s)]
*  Kamala, you've been MIA. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=496.14s)]
*  Joe's been MIA. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=498.14s)]
*  You're lying and saying everybody's fine, everybody's been taken care of and everybody's [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=500.14s)]
*  happy. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=504.14s)]
*  Mallorca says you're bankrupt. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=505.14s)]
*  FEMA's website said you gave a billion to your illegal immigrants. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=507.14s)]
*  You're not doing your job by going on the, you know, call me daddy website. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=511.14s)]
*  Only about $4 million. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=515.8399999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=517.3399999999999s)]
*  It was dispensed from FEMA, and it took them a week to show up. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=518.3399999999999s)]
*  Thousands upon thousands of Americans have lost absolutely everything. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=522.84s)]
*  They're using horses and mules, but not helicopters and government planes and our [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=527.24s)]
*  military. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=533.44s)]
*  Entire towns washed away, roads, highways, bridges, they are closed indefinitely. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=534.44s)]
*  Power, clean drinking water, still in short supply. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=540.44s)]
*  The level of suffering has been immense, and you have done nothing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=544.44s)]
*  And here is what Kamala was posting on X two days ago. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=548.44s)]
*  Look at this quote, the people of Lebanon are facing an increasingly dire humanitarian [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=551.5400000000001s)]
*  situation. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=556.5400000000001s)]
*  I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=557.5400000000001s)]
*  continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians in Lebanon. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=564.5400000000001s)]
*  But to that end, the U.S. will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=568.5400000000001s)]
*  people of Lebanon for essential needs, food, shelter, water, protection, sanitation, to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=574.5400000000001s)]
*  help those who have been displaced by the recent conflict. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=580.64s)]
*  This additional support brings total U.S. assistance to Lebanon over last year, to over [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=583.64s)]
*  $385 million. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=591.64s)]
*  Give it to North Carolina and Georgia. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=593.04s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of Americans suffering. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=595.64s)]
*  You're telling us about Lebanon? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=599.04s)]
*  What about the suffering Americans in our country, those states impacted by Hurricane [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=601.14s)]
*  Helene? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=605.74s)]
*  What about the people there? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=606.74s)]
*  Our very own Peter Doocy had an opportunity to ask Colleen Jean-Pierre about this earlier [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=607.94s)]
*  today. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=612.64s)]
*  She didn't like the question. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=613.64s)]
*  Peter's a thousand percent right. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=614.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=616.44s)]
*  On this issue of funding, the administration has money to send to Lebanon without Congress [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=617.44s)]
*  coming back. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=625.24s)]
*  But Congress does have to come back to approve money to send to people in North Carolina. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=626.24s)]
*  Do I have that right? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=631.44s)]
*  Here's what I'm going to be very clear about. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=633.44s)]
*  The president and the vice president has had a robust whole of government response to this. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=635.74s)]
*  President Biden is fond of saying, show me your budget and I will tell you what you value. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=642.74s)]
*  If he's got money for people in Lebanon right now without Congress having to come back, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=647.74s)]
*  what does it say about his values? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=653.74s)]
*  There is not enough money right now for people in North Carolina. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=654.74s)]
*  That's not misinformation. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=658.74s)]
*  Wait. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=660.74s)]
*  No, that is. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=661.74s)]
*  The whole premise of the question is misinformation, sir. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=663.24s)]
*  What you do— [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=665.24s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=666.24s)]
*  Yes, yes, it's misinformation. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=667.24s)]
*  Winsport. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=668.24s)]
*  Joe said everybody's needs are taken care of and they're happy. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=670.24s)]
*  That's misinformation. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=673.24s)]
*  No money for the Southeast, hundreds of millions for Lebanon. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=675.24s)]
*  Last week, Biden pledged another three billion—actually, it was eight billion to Ukraine. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=679.24s)]
*  Each U.S. taxpayer, you know, on top of the—is sending more than—you know, taxpayers more [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=684.24s)]
*  than 12 billion to Ukraine. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=689.74s)]
*  On top of the nearly 200 total, Ethiopia gets more than 2 billion. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=691.74s)]
*  The Taliban gets 1.3 billion. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=696.74s)]
*  Another 1.3 billion for Yemen. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=699.74s)]
*  More than a billion went to Egypt, Jordan, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and I can keep [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=701.74s)]
*  going. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=706.74s)]
*  The U.S. spent a whopping 18 billion on the anti-American, anti-Semitic U.N. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=707.74s)]
*  along with 850 million for the corrupt WHO that was the propaganda wing for the communist [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=712.74s)]
*  Chinese during COVID and millions more for the globalist World Economic Forum. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=718.74s)]
*  But FEMA's out of money, Mayorkas says, and won't have the funds to make it through [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=724.24s)]
*  hurricane season. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=728.74s)]
*  And, you know, they're totally, completely missing in action. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=730.24s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=734.24s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration doesn't care. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=735.24s)]
*  They've abandoned the people in the Southeast in this country, and they seem to only care [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=738.24s)]
*  about people abroad. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=743.24s)]
*  And the response from them has been callous. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=744.74s)]
*  It has been incompetent. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=748.24s)]
*  It has been the worst hurricane response in our history. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=749.74s)]
*  David Axelrod sees the suffering all over the Southeast, and he views it as a political [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=753.24s)]
*  win. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=758.74s)]
*  For Democrats, you can't make this up. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=759.74s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=760.74s)]
*  There's a lot of displacement in Western North Carolina. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=761.74s)]
*  Now, Asheville is a blue dot in that area, but there are a lot of Republican voters there. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=765.74s)]
*  I was going to say, Asheville is key. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=770.74s)]
*  But those voters in Asheville are, they're, you know, the kind of voters who will figure [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=772.24s)]
*  out a way to vote. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=778.74s)]
*  You know, they're upscale kind of liberal voters, and they're probably going to figure [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=779.74s)]
*  out a way to vote. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=785.24s)]
*  I'm not sure a bunch of these folks who've had their homes and lives destroyed elsewhere [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=786.24s)]
*  in Western North Carolina in the mountains there are going to be as easy to wrangle for [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKwoPV-LxYI&t=791.24s)]
