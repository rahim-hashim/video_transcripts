# Jim Jordan: It’s ‘ridiculous’ to say there’s no evidence against Biden
**Fox News:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg)
*  here now with reaction. He is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Jim Jordan is with us, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=0.0s)]
*  sir. You know, I'm getting a little sick and tired of this comment that are made by liberal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=5.04s)]
*  commentators and by Democrats. There's not a shred of evidence, nothing at all whatsoever, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=10.64s)]
*  that ties Hunter Biden and his foreign business dealings with Joe Biden. Now, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=17.28s)]
*  Jim Jordan, I think it would probably in a minute, you could blow that right out of the water. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  So I will ask you. Yeah, there's meetings, there's dinners, there's phone calls, multiple times. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=28.96s)]
*  The only thing that's changed in this whole thing is the story from the White House. First, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=37.36s)]
*  they said nothing. And then we find out all these multiple meetings, multiple dinners, multiple phone [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=41.04s)]
*  calls into, into what Joe Biden is part of these. So for them to say that there's nothing there is [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  just ridiculous. And it goes right back to the beginning, Sean, when, when Joe Biden sits down [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=52.0s)]
*  with the mayor of Moscow with Hunter Biden, with his business partners and says, no, he never had [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=57.6s)]
*  any involvement. This is the same lady that gave Hunter Biden over a million, 3.5 million dollars. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=62.88s)]
*  It all starts back in 2014 and she's connected to Burisma. She's connected to where this all starts. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=67.76s)]
*  So for them to say that makes no sense. That's why we're going to have an impeachment inquiry vote. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=73.84s)]
*  It'll help us get additional witnesses in, which will buttress, I think, the already compelling [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=78.32s)]
*  evidence that we have. But it wasn't, you're talking about Elena Baturina. That's the Russian [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=83.12s)]
*  oligarch. That's the former first lady of Moscow. But it wasn't just the 3.5 million dollars. Didn't [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=89.04s)]
*  Devon Archer testify and say that she invested over a hundred million dollars in a real estate [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=94.4s)]
*  venture that Hunter was involved in and the family was involved in? That's a hundred million [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=103.44s)]
*  dollars from a Russian oligarch. And by the way, the same Russian oligarchy at dinner with a cafe [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=109.28s)]
*  Milano, correct? Correct. And the timing is interesting because when that first investment [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=114.16s)]
*  happens, it's in February of 2014, it happens a week before Russia invades Crimea. And then it's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=119.28s)]
*  two weeks after when there are sanctions put on all kinds of oligarchs in Russia and her, for some [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=126.4s)]
*  reason, she escapes the sanctions. And then literally the very next month, the very next month [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=131.68s)]
*  in Italy is when the head of the Burisma offers Hunter Biden a position on the board. And at that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=137.2s)]
*  meeting is also none other than Elena Baturina. So it's, they're all connected right from the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=143.76s)]
*  get-go and they continue this pattern of shaking down foreign companies, foreign influence and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  getting the money all the way through while he's vice president. And then of course it continued [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=154.0s)]
*  all the way into 2018. Okay. Well, let's look at, I think, the biggest slam dunk case and that is the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=158.72s)]
*  Burisma case because, and again, I'll throw out the dates. It was October of 2015. It became [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=164.48s)]
*  official Obama administration policy that, that they had felt, interagency groups had felt [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=171.6s)]
*  that Ukraine made enough progress on the issue of corruption that they were willing to give a billion [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  in loan guarantees. That's October of 2015. Okay. Fast forward, December of 2015, five days before [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=184.72s)]
*  Joe goes to Ukraine, Hunter in Dubai with Burisma executives, the people paying him millions of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=191.92s)]
*  dollars, they call Joe Biden and five days later, Joe Biden then goes against Obama administration [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  policy while he's in Ukraine, leverages a billion taxpayer dollars. And as a result, they gave him [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=205.27999999999997s)]
*  six hours to fire the prosecutor, investigating Burisma, investigating his son. And that official [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=211.92s)]
*  action as vice president then benefited his son who admitted he had no experience in Ukraine, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=217.76s)]
*  energy, oil or gas, but was being paid millions of dollars and admitted he was an addict at the time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=223.92s)]
*  So how was that not his involvement? Because he seems very involved in it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  No, we think it, we think it certainly was. And you're exactly right. He leverages your tax dollars, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=235.2s)]
*  the people I represent, their tax dollars, the American people's tax money. He leverages that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=239.68s)]
*  to get an outcome that will benefit the company his son sits on the board of. That all happened [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=244.08s)]
*  as clear as day. And I always say there are four fundamental facts here. Fact number one, Hunter [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=248.96s)]
*  Biden gets put on that board of Burisma. Fact number two, he's not qualified. He said so himself. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  He said he got the job because of his last name, which by the way was confirmed by his business [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=258.16s)]
*  partner, Devin Archer, when we deposed him this past summer. Fact number three, as you point out, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=262.64s)]
*  he's asked to relieve the pressure that they're under from the prosecutor. Fact number four, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=266.72s)]
*  he goes there, gets the prosecutor fired, but uses our tax money to accomplish that goal. Again, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=272.24s)]
*  old as time, this story is as old as it gets. Politician does certain things that benefit his [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=278.72s)]
*  family financially. And then most importantly, there's an effort to conceal it, an effort to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=284.56s)]
*  cover it up, sweep it under the rug, which is what David Weiss has done now for five years, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=289.68s)]
*  both as the U.S. attorney and now again, I believe as special counsel. Okay. Then you have, he's making [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  more money in energy or more energy deals, and that goes to the WhatsApp message. If you remember [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=300.64s)]
*  the 1023 form. Now in that WhatsApp message, I am sitting here next to my father. They're mad that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  you didn't fulfill your commitment. Between everybody he knows, my ability to hold the grudge, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=312.4s)]
*  you're going to regret not following through on your commitment. Anyway, we are sitting here, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=316.88s)]
*  meaning Hunter and Joe, waiting for the call. And didn't Hunter also implicate his father as being [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=321.44s)]
*  a recipient of the money, half my income to Pops? Didn't we learn from Jason Smith's committee last [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=326.72s)]
*  week that Joe himself using an alias account, an email account, was emailing directly with [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=332.72s)]
*  Eric Sherwin? Don't we have emails between Sherwin and Hunter that say what account should I take the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=339.36s)]
*  money out of to pay for dad's home repairs? Didn't we have Hunter complaining half his income goes [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=344.72s)]
*  to Pops? So it seems to me like that's all implicating Joe Biden. And then we hear again [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=350.4s)]
*  and again, there's no evidence. I'll give you the last word on this. Well, and it's why we want to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=356.64s)]
*  move forward with this impeachment inquiry vote where the full house goes on record. A majority of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  the House of Representatives says, yes, we're in official impeachment inquiry phase of our oversight [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=365.44s)]
*  responsibilities because we think we'll be able to get additional emails better from the administration. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  We'll have a better chance of getting that if we have to go to court and we'll get to have in for [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=375.84s)]
*  depositions these people we're talking with, we think they're going to come in, but they'll come [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=379.68s)]
*  in sooner. They'll come in faster if in fact we have an official vote and pass that on Wednesday. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=383.76s)]
*  But Ken Buck says he won't. Do you see any Democrats that maybe don't want Joe at the top of the ticket? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=389.52s)]
*  Are they going to join forces with Republicans on this and vote for the impeachment inquiry? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=395.44s)]
*  I doubt it. But I do think we're going to get enough Republican votes. There's a couple of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=400.48s)]
*  people I want to talk to, but I do think we'll get the Republican votes and be able to get all [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=404.64s)]
*  the info. We've got a lot now and I think it's compelling as we just talked about, but I think [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=409.6s)]
*  we'll be able to get more information if in fact we have that vote and inevitably have to go to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=413.36s)]
*  court to get the documents and get some of these witnesses in for the depositions. Maybe you'll [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  lose Ken Buck. I mean he's not been particularly helpful on pretty much everything. Anyway, Jim [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YcYhMgRHg&t=421.92s)]
