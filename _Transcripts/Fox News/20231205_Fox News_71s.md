# Trump asked whether he’d abuse government powers
**Fox News:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM)
*  Because I see what the media is doing now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=0.0s)]
*  I put a montage together. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=2.24s)]
*  They want to call you a dictator. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=4.28s)]
*  You use the words, I am your retribution. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=6.4s)]
*  And now, before that, you said if you've been wronged and you used other words as well, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=11.0s)]
*  but I want to be very, very clear on this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=15.36s)]
*  To be clear, do you in any way have any plans whatsoever, if re-elected president, to abuse [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=17.8s)]
*  power, to break the law, to use the government to go after people? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=25.2s)]
*  You mean like they're using right now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=30.28s)]
*  So in the history of our country, what's happened to us, again, has never happened before. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=32.24s)]
*  Over nonsense, over nothing, made up charges. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=42.0s)]
*  I often say Al Capone, he was one of the greatest of all time, if you like criminals. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  He was a mob boss, the likes of which Scarface, they call him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=51.48s)]
*  And he got indicted once. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  I got indicted four times. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-nKHC2AQM&t=56.559999999999995s)]
