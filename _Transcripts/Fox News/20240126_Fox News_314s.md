# Hannity: Biden is committing dereliction of duty at the border
**Fox News:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY)
*  Welcome to Hannity and a busy news night tonight by a vote of 255 to 67. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=0.0s)]
*  Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, was found in contempt of Congress. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  He served no jail time. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=14.08s)]
*  Well, corrupt left-wing IRS director, remember Lois Lerner, found in contempt of Congress. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=15.44s)]
*  Also, zero days in jail. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=20.6s)]
*  Hunter Biden, he refused to comply with an initial House subpoena and sent lawmakers [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=23.44s)]
*  on a wild goose chase, taunting them every step of the way. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=28.64s)]
*  Hunter Biden will face no jail time for contempt of Congress and is now complying after asking [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=32.24s)]
*  for a brand new subpoena. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=38.68s)]
*  By the way, naturally, two former Trump advisors, not so lucky. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=40.84s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=44.6s)]
*  Joe Biden's Department of Justice is now trying to lock up both Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=45.6s)]
*  In fact, Navarro was only sentenced to four months in prison this week, and Peter Navarro [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=50.88s)]
*  will join us and first tell us story exclusively here tonight. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=57.8s)]
*  But first, breaking tonight, as reported by our very own Bill Molluskian, quote, in Friday [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  News Dump, Customs and Border Patrol officials report 302,034 migrant, which would be illegal [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=67.28s)]
*  immigrant encounters in December, the highest month ever recorded. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=76.12s)]
*  And CBP also reports the Border Patrol arrested 19 more people on the FBI terrorist watchlist [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=81.44s)]
*  in December, bringing the total to 50 arrests for the fiscal year 2024 so far. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=88.32s)]
*  And as John Solomon first reported right here on this program last night, high ranking former [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  FBI officials are now calling the crisis at our southern border an alarming and perilous [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=101.0s)]
*  invasion of military aged male foreigners who pose one of the most pernicious ever threats [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=107.24s)]
*  to American security. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=114.88s)]
*  And now the showdown at the Texas border. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  It is escalating thanks to your president. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=121.24s)]
*  Joe Biden issued a deadline of today demanding that Texas allow federal officials access [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=122.24s)]
*  to Shelby Park. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  This is at Eagles Pass and a legal immigration hotspot on the border that was seized by Texas [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  officials. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  In other words, Biden painted himself into a corner now, but it's breaking tonight. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  Texas, they're not going to comply. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  So what's Joe Biden going to do now? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  Is he going to try and federalize the Texas Guard, as some Democrats are recommending? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=146.10000000000002s)]
*  Is he going to try to arrest the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=150.44s)]
*  Will he order a physical confrontation between Texas security officials? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=154.74s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=159.74s)]
*  This is a huge crisis. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=162.08s)]
*  Joe Biden has now been put, has put them in a position where he's pitting law enforcement [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=164.94s)]
*  versus law enforcement, but a senior border patrol official to their credit telling Fox [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  News border security agents have zero plans to remove razor wire or impede Texas from [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=174.5s)]
*  securing their border. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=181.82s)]
*  He emphasized that his agency's relationship with Texas is strong. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=183.54s)]
*  Customs and Border Patrol agents also reportedly respect and appreciate what Texas is doing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=189.34s)]
*  And meanwhile, Texas Governor Abbott is now offering cash payments to law enforcement [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=195.9s)]
*  personnel that volunteer to man the border. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=200.34s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is working on a measure to send the Florida State Guard [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=203.62s)]
*  to Texas to help out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=208.26s)]
*  South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is vowing to ship razor wire and send in that state's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=209.9s)]
*  National Guard. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=215.9s)]
*  Virginia, they've already deployed a hundred soldiers and airmen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  Arkansas and Nebraska have also previously deployed members of their National Guard and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=220.94s)]
*  are vowing to send more in the future. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=226.86s)]
*  North Dakota Governor Bergram, well, he sent 125 soldiers from the 817th Engineer Company. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=229.3s)]
*  More and more states now are stepping up to the plate to fill a void left by Joe Biden's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=236.86s)]
*  dereliction of duty. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=241.82s)]
*  He's not fulfilling his oath to our Constitution, his oath of office. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=243.74s)]
*  He's not enforcing the laws of the land. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=248.3s)]
*  Not only that, he's aiding and abetting and law breaking. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=250.74s)]
*  It is now more than ever obvious that either Joe Biden is the single most incompetent person [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  to have ever stepped foot in the Oval Office or he's just perpetuating the border crisis [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=260.7s)]
*  on purpose. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=266.02s)]
*  To be honest, it's probably a mixture of both. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=267.18s)]
*  Why is Joe Biden willing to set deadlines and possibly even use force against the state [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=270.94s)]
*  of Texas and Texas National Guard? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=277.46s)]
*  But let's see, he cowers in fear when it comes to Iran and China and Russia and the hooty [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  rebels in Yemen. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=287.46s)]
*  Why does Biden seem to hate fellow Americans more than the terrorists that want to kill [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=289.16s)]
*  us overseas or maybe some that got into our country with the nearly 10 million illegal, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=293.46s)]
*  unvetted Joe Biden immigrants? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHPxJIZFtY&t=299.46s)]
