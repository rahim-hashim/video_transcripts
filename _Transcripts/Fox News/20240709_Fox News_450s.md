# Peter Doocy reveals what it is really like in the White House press briefing room
**Fox News:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg)
*  And as questions continue to swirl around Joe Biden's health, new information continues [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=0.0s)]
*  to come to light. White House visitor logs now show that a noted neurologist and movement [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=7.92s)]
*  disorders specialist from Walter Reed Medical Center, who has recently studied Parkinson's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=14.4s)]
*  disease, visited the White House eight times since last year. So what was he doing there? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=19.96s)]
*  Well, Karine Jean-Pierre was not really willing to tell anyone today. In fact, she wouldn't [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=26.639999999999997s)]
*  even confirm whether the doctor in question even went to the White House at all. Take [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  a look at this wild exchange. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=36.32s)]
*  The president, I can tell you, has seen a neurologist three times as it's connected [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=38.0s)]
*  to a physical that he gets every year that we provide to all of them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=43.04s)]
*  Karine, I'll ask you a very basic, direct question. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=47.32s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=49.8s)]
*  I just, wait. Hold on a second. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, wait a minute. Ed, please. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=54.4s)]
*  A little respect here. Security reasons. We cannot share names. We cannot share names. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=66.44s)]
*  We have to, we have to. We cannot. No, no, no, no. We cannot share names of specialists [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=72.72s)]
*  broadly from a dermatologist to a neurologist. We cannot share names. There are security [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=81.84s)]
*  reasons. We have to, we have to protect. I understand that. I hear you. I hear you. I [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  cannot from here confirm any of that because we have to keep their privacy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  All right. Here now with more is Fox News, senior White House correspondent, Peter Ducey. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  I say this affectionately to you as I was watching this White House briefing today, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=106.0s)]
*  it was almost like the whole room became like Peter Ducey and asked real questions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=115.36s)]
*  And at times it even got hostile. And I saw a pretty shaken up and upset Karine Jean-Pierre, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=119.92s)]
*  a lot different than the average day at that press briefing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  And that's a good thing that there were some other Peter Ducey type questions because I did [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=130.8s)]
*  not ultimately wind up getting called on at any point today. But the problem with her answer [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=137.52s)]
*  that the president has seen a neurologist three times for each of the three physicals that they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=143.28s)]
*  have told us about is that the last one was in February, about five months ago. And based on [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  all of the reporting from people who are anonymously talking to the New York Times and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=156.0s)]
*  the Washington Post in the five months since that last published physical report, that is when these [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=160.48s)]
*  people who are anonymously around the president say that he has started to show signs of miss [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=169.2s)]
*  speaking more, losing his train of thought. And she insists that he has not been re-screened for [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=174.88s)]
*  any of these on MSNBC today, they were calling them age-related illnesses in the time since. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=182.32s)]
*  But what a difference a couple months makes because when I asked Karine Jean-Pierre in February, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  before the Her report came out about this fundraiser where the president kept telling donors [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=194.88s)]
*  that he had just gotten back from a conference where he spoke to a European leader who was long [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=200.56s)]
*  dead, I was told that a question like that is a rabbit hole, but it's not a rabbit hole anymore. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=204.96s)]
*  And I have a feeling that as soon as she went back into the press area, there was a big discussion [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  about how exactly they're going to get the entire press corps covering something else. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=220.08s)]
*  It's not just us anymore. You know, Peter, since before the last election, I've been pointing out [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=226.0s)]
*  the fact that Joe was weak and frail and a cognitive mess. I've been criticized for it, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=232.56s)]
*  but it was transparent and obvious to anybody with eyes to see. It was only a few weeks ago [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=238.24s)]
*  that the media and the White House were telling Americans that real videos, unedited videos of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=245.52s)]
*  Joe Biden were cheap fake videos of right-wing media. They were real videos. But what really [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=251.84s)]
*  frustrates me is you work with a lot of people and you've always been very honest and you've [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=259.2s)]
*  been willing to ask the tough questions on a daily basis. Not now that their back is against the wall, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  but you'd never convince me in a million years that every single person in that room that covers [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=269.44s)]
*  that president didn't know that he had trouble getting up the big boy stairs, Air Force One, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=275.2s)]
*  as I say, he needed to be surrounded to get on and off Marine One, that he rarely does unscripted [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=280.96s)]
*  press conferences and that when he does, he struggles. He always struggles. He even struggles [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=287.44s)]
*  with a teleprompter. They've known for the whole time. And to me, that's a cover-up. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=294.0s)]
*  What is the reaction? Does that come up in the press briefing in any way or among discussions [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=300.48s)]
*  you all have? It's a new thing in the briefing room. And you look at the last couple of months, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=306.08s)]
*  they've gone to shorter stairs on Air Force One. They've gone to shorter speeches just about [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=312.48s)]
*  everywhere. But they've also gone from making jokes about the president's age, which they started [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=316.56s)]
*  to do after the HUR report came out, to now getting like 50 questions about whether or not the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=320.64s)]
*  president has been tested or is being treated for Parkinson's disease. That is a huge change. And [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=327.92s)]
*  if the White House is not going to have better answers about why, and these White House visitor [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=337.44s)]
*  logs that people are talking about, they are public. And it's not like a database that you [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=342.96s)]
*  have to comb through. You can just look on your phone, White House visitor log, type in this [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  doctor's name, Kevin Kennard. It pops up. You can see that he met with the president's physician. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=351.76s)]
*  It's in the New York Post, Ronnie Jackson, who treated Trump and Obama and Bush, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=358.08s)]
*  he says that that physician would only be taking meetings like that for something relating to the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  president's care. And so the answer from the White House about we can't talk about anything [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=371.6s)]
*  because there's a privacy concern, maybe they are concerned about privacy, but it would be the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  president's privacy or somebody in the first family, according to what Ronnie Jackson is putting [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=384.48s)]
*  out in the New York Post. This is a cover-up of historic proportions. And the cover-up has been [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=390.16s)]
*  state-run media and most of the people, unfortunately, I would argue that you work [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=398.48s)]
*  with. I don't want to drag you into what I say. And every Democrat as well, and all the people [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=403.76s)]
*  that have been around him, everybody knows, everybody has known, and they've known for years. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=408.8s)]
*  And that's why he gets instructions, the Axios Report, Walk to Podium in big font. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=414.88s)]
*  That is, we've known about that. Here, let us give you a list of questions if you're going to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=421.76s)]
*  interview the president. Anyway, Peter Ducey, we appreciate you. I think you've been vindicated [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=427.76s)]
*  in a lot of this as well. Thank you for your time. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFZoYYDUNg&t=434.71999999999997s)]
