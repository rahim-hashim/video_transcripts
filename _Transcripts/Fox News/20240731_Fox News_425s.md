# Harris Faulkner: Trump went to a place that was ‘pretty hostile’
**Fox News:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ)
*  Now earlier today, not everyone on stage was out to get Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Our friend and colleague, the anchor of the Faulkner Focus, Harris Faulkner, she raised [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=4.32s)]
*  several very fair, very important issues. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=11.64s)]
*  I want to talk about something that bursts. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=12.64s)]
*  And this is the weight of the inflation on this country right now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=16.04s)]
*  Much of that falls on the shoulders of single moms, single black moms, when you look statistically. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=20.32s)]
*  How do you turn it around? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=27.2s)]
*  What's your plan for the black community when it comes to money? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=28.36s)]
*  The inflation is absolutely destroying our middle class, our working class, virtually [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=31.28s)]
*  every class. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=38.04s)]
*  Inflation is a disaster in our country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=39.56s)]
*  Inflation is a country buster. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=42.9s)]
*  It breaks every country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=44.44s)]
*  We had, in my opinion, the worst inflation we've had. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=45.86s)]
*  They say it's 58 years, but I think it's much more than that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  People can't buy houses. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=52.44s)]
*  They no longer have the American dream. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=54.06s)]
*  Young people, young black people, they don't have the American dream anymore. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=56.8s)]
*  They can't buy a house. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  They can't borrow the money because of the cost of the money. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=62.26s)]
*  They can't buy it because of the cost of housing, because of the cost of building, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=65.46s)]
*  because of inflation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=69.0s)]
*  Inflation is a disaster, and it's destroying our country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=70.92s)]
*  All right, joining us now with more, the anchor of the Faulkner Focus, our friend Harris [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=75.0s)]
*  Faulkner, also the host of Outnumbered. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  Great to see you, Harris. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=83.0s)]
*  So it was great to see you up there, too. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=84.0s)]
*  I was glad you had the opportunity. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=85.32s)]
*  Tell us from your perspective, because it seemed hostile, but on the other hand, maybe [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=89.16s)]
*  I didn't hear the crowd right, and you can bring us in the room. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=94.44s)]
*  I heard a lot of people cheering for Donald Trump. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=98.08s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=101.0s)]
*  No, you're not wrong. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=102.0s)]
*  I mean, there were people who were, you know, he's funny. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=105.0s)]
*  So there were people who were listening closely enough to catch some of his humor and to laugh [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  at that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=112.52s)]
*  There were a couple of times when people didn't like what he said. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  But at one point when he was talking about inflation and how he would try to turn things [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  around with drill, baby drill and energy and really going after that sector and making [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  things cheaper in that sector, we're in heat waves, we're in coal spells, we're in all [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=128.0s)]
*  those things, making living, you know, cheaper to do with quality reserved. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=132.2s)]
*  When he was going into all of that, apparently somebody in the front row, I couldn't see [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=139.16s)]
*  this woman, but apparently she was smiling, waving, doing something. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=143.08s)]
*  He said, oh, OK, so you know what I'm talking about. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=146.0s)]
*  You like what I'm saying. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  So you know, there are some universals out there that we as human beings go to when we [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=150.52s)]
*  talk about the economy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  I thought two things about today. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't like it particularly when you're driven solely by emotion. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=159.24s)]
*  So by getting the conversation tipped off, by making it so emotional and so personal [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  with one journalist and one interviewee, ABC News reporter versus Donald Trump, what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=170.16s)]
*  happens there is that you keep the issues out and people aren't going to vote on whether [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=177.12s)]
*  or not those two like each other on stage. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=181.76s)]
*  What people are going to vote on is, well, did he say anything? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=184.44s)]
*  Did he leave something out that I need in my life? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=187.12s)]
*  Help me choose. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  I have now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, this day is over, Sean. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  So now we've got 96 days left. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  How do I make a choice this November, having the potential Democratic candidate just dumped [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=196.76s)]
*  in the lap of voters and compare them to the man who has now gone to a place that was pretty [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=202.6s)]
*  hostile? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=208.24s)]
*  I mean, they were expecting a lot of protesters. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=209.24s)]
*  You had some hostility behind the scenes at the National Association of Black Journalists [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=211.32s)]
*  as there was pressure on the NABJ not to host Donald Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=215.96s)]
*  They wanted them to rescind some of those journalists, rescind the invitation to the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=219.96s)]
*  president. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=223.24s)]
*  So there were things you saw. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=224.72s)]
*  One of the co-chairs of this huge annual event bow out yesterday, just quit, saying, well, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=226.16s)]
*  for several reasons, Axios reporting it was internal and external pressure on her for [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=232.32s)]
*  having been part of an apparatus that booked Donald Trump as the featured speaker today [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=237.32s)]
*  at this big conference of black journalists. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  But I saw some opportunities to really press in. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=246.9s)]
*  I wanted to know about Senator JD Vance. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=249.12s)]
*  Sean, you and I have both covered this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=251.56s)]
*  I watch your show. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=253.32s)]
*  You've pressed the president. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=254.56s)]
*  Why did you choose him? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=255.56s)]
*  He's had some stumbles. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=256.56s)]
*  Is he really ready for day one? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=258.32s)]
*  And there were times when audio was really a problem. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=260.76s)]
*  I mean, they had tech issues at NABJ that we could have even helped them with and would [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=264.0s)]
*  have been happy to. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=268.44s)]
*  They chose a different route, and it was pretty bad in there. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=270.44s)]
*  Like, we couldn't always hear each other. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=273.56s)]
*  But I do think that that point got across. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=275.96s)]
*  I repeated myself a couple of times. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=278.6s)]
*  I think people do have that question. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=280.4s)]
*  We've covered it enough to know. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  Why him? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=284.12s)]
*  What's your plan moving forward with your VP pick? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=285.12s)]
*  He told me, Sean, on the very day that he was shot four hours after I sat with him at [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=287.6s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago in an assassination attempt on his life. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  And I said this to the audience today. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  I said, you told me that picking a VP was important because now you realize bad things [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  can happen. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=304.0s)]
*  He said it twice. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=305.0s)]
*  Four hours later, a bad thing, a really bad thing happened. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=306.16s)]
*  So is this the guy that you have faith in? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=310.16s)]
*  And if you do, talk about him. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=312.36s)]
*  He did a bit, but I think it bears saying Kamala Harris is going to make her VP pick. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=314.6s)]
*  Are you ready for that? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  Is this guy ready? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=322.4s)]
*  So I had some substantive questions that I did get to. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=323.4s)]
*  But when you go down an emotional road or a gotcha moment, it makes it difficult. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=328.2s)]
*  And I worked my best as a journalist to get us back on track to having a real, what we [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  promised the audience, a real conversation. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=338.8s)]
*  I love the fact that some of those very journalists, Sean, who criticized the situation with inviting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=341.76s)]
*  Trump sat there and listened and participated, more than 1100 of them. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=348.08s)]
*  And then you have rows and rows and rows of global American national local media taking [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=355.36s)]
*  it in. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=361.76s)]
*  I mean, I think that's where we should be. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=362.76s)]
*  I don't want to know journalists as activists. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=364.88s)]
*  What was actually a real bright side of this? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=367.88s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, I don't like identity politics. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=371.32s)]
*  My Christian faith, I know we share the same faith. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't like demographic breakdowns. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=380.08s)]
*  The bottom line to me is, are you more safe and more secure in your town and in your city? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=382.4s)]
*  Are the borders more secure? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=387.52s)]
*  Is the economy, how's that working out for you and your family? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  How are you doing economically? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=393.84s)]
*  How's your educational system, which is the ladder to success in this country? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=395.56s)]
*  How are we on the world stage? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  What is our role on the world stage? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AELUmF8vaQ&t=401.28000000000003s)]
