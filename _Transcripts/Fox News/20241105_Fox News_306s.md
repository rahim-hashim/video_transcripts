# Ron DeSantis: Electing Kamala Harris is like re-electing Joe Biden
**Fox News:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec)
*  Joining us now to weigh in on the state of the race ahead of Election Day tomorrow, Florida [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor Rondo Santos. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=4.66s)]
*  Governor, you know what this feeling is like. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  And it's kind of interesting to me. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=7.9s)]
*  Candidates like yourself, like President Trump, you put it all out there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=11.82s)]
*  You put it all in the line. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=16.28s)]
*  And then you sit, the voters have their say, and you wait. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=18.66s)]
*  Not the best feeling in the world I'm imagining, when it's at some point it just is out of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=23.16s)]
*  your hands. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=28.16s)]
*  And that's the point we're now at pretty much as they finish their final remarks. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=29.16s)]
*  President Trump will wrap up in Grand Rapids, Michigan tonight. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=33.88s)]
*  Well, Sean, as a fellow Floridian, I think you'll at least appreciate this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=36.8s)]
*  This is the first election this century and probably many years before that, where the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=42.22s)]
*  state of Florida is not one of those swing states. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=47.32s)]
*  And you've covered these elections for a long time. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=50.28s)]
*  You know, I've been involved. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=52.78s)]
*  always ground zero, especially for Republicans, because if Republican doesn't win Florida, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=55.28s)]
*  the math gets impossible to get to 270. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=59.84s)]
*  As we go into the Election Day tomorrow, registered Republicans have come out in Florida 10 points [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  more than registered Democrats. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=69.36s)]
*  Of course, we now have a 1.1 million vote lead. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=71.58s)]
*  So the sense of anxiety down here in the Sunshine State is definitely less than it was four [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  years ago or eight years ago or even longer than that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=80.82s)]
*  This is going to be a really good performance here in the state of Florida. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=84.26s)]
*  That we know for sure. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=90.54s)]
*  You know, it's very interesting. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=91.54s)]
*  There was a piece in The Washington Post that suggested, well, younger people may have to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=93.38000000000001s)]
*  lower their expectations for what the American dream would be and maybe settle for a townhouse. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  I'm older. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=103.7s)]
*  I'm into downsizing a little bit. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=104.7s)]
*  I don't want a big house right now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=107.06s)]
*  I like a small house. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=108.34s)]
*  For a lot of Americans, the idea that we have to lower our expectations and give up on the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=110.04s)]
*  aspirations that have really built this country and the dreams that built this country, wow, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=115.8s)]
*  that is deep, that is profound. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=121.68s)]
*  It's almost like Jimmy Carter lecturing us again that we need a sweater. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  It seems like we're back in that time. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=127.0s)]
*  How much of the failure of the Harris-Biden administration will factor into people's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=129.54s)]
*  thinking, or will it resonate? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=135.4s)]
*  Will they be successful calling Donald Trump a Nazi, fascist, racist and every other name [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=137.3s)]
*  in the book? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=142.70000000000002s)]
*  Will that resonate? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  But I think the analogy to the Jimmy Carter years is a really good one. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  Remember, they were saying similar things back then. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=150.94s)]
*  They said it's an era of limits. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=153.38000000000002s)]
*  Everybody's just got to learn to get by with less. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=155.78s)]
*  You're not going to be able to have energy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=158.74s)]
*  You're not going to be able to increase your standard of living. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=160.22000000000003s)]
*  And you just kind of had to deal with it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=162.3s)]
*  Ronald Reagan had different ideas to that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=164.82000000000002s)]
*  He proved them wrong. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=167.1s)]
*  And so I think if you look at the rut we've been in under Biden-Harris, it's a similar [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=168.1s)]
*  situation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  And they're basically trying to say that this is as good as it can get. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=174.38s)]
*  They brag about the economy, even though prices have gone up dramatically for the American [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=177.98s)]
*  people over the last three and a half years, even though we have high interest rates, much [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=183.06s)]
*  higher than they've been any time this century. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  And so they're telling you that this is as good as it gets. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=191.06s)]
*  And if you believe that, then you don't know American history. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=194.66000000000003s)]
*  I don't think people are going to buy that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  And I think the fact that they do the name calling and all this other stuff, I think [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=200.38000000000002s)]
*  it shows substantively they don't really have anything to offer to the American people. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=204.02s)]
*  And especially Kamala. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=208.26000000000002s)]
*  This is somebody that claims she's running on being a change agent, that she's going [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  to turn the page. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=214.4s)]
*  And yet when she's asked, what would you have done different than Joe Biden, who is not [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=215.5s)]
*  a popular president, she says she can't think of anything. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=224.7s)]
*  Maybe having secured the border, that would have been something different than people [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=225.7s)]
*  would have liked. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=228.1s)]
*  What about not having 13 Americans killed in Afghanistan, our service members, because [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=229.1s)]
*  of that fiasco? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=233.7s)]
*  There's so many things that this administration's come up short. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=234.7s)]
*  And yet she was there with him in lockstep every step of the way. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=238.05999999999997s)]
*  And so if you elect Harris, you're kind of reelecting Biden, but you're reelecting Biden, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=242.22s)]
*  a version of Biden that's more vapid, much more liberal and even much less accomplished. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=247.72s)]
*  So why would you want to do that given so many people see the country's going in the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=253.94s)]
*  wrong track right now? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=257.96s)]
*  Yeah, Governor, great to see you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=259.86s)]
*  I will say this was nice. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=263.34s)]
*  I did have to show my voter ID, which I was glad to show. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=264.7s)]
*  Your free state, our free state of Florida. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=268.62s)]
*  I'm honored to have you as my governor. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=270.3s)]
*  And the lines weren't too bad. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=273.1s)]
*  It was quick, easy, it was efficient. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=274.74s)]
*  I voted early and the first time I ever did that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=276.34s)]
*  And you're right, I have confidence in Florida's election integrity. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=279.78s)]
*  You're going to get quick results, Sean. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=282.18s)]
*  You're not going to have to wait until Friday for your results. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=283.94s)]
*  You will get the results tomorrow night in no time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=290.18s)]
*  All right, Governor, thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=291.18s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViNbOvilIec&t=293.3s)]
