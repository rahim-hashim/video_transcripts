# Dems are ‘lost in the wilderness’: Vivek Ramaswamy
**Fox News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk)
*  Here with more is Ohio gubernatorial candidate now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=0.0s)]
*  It's official the vague Rama Swami is with us and is 500 billion that was identified by Senator Rand Paul and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=3.1s)]
*  Elon Musk in previously approved spending that they believe they have the ability to cut that's a big number now [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=10.68s)]
*  We're getting into the trillions of dollars, which was the goal originally, right? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=17.72s)]
*  Absolutely, and I think that there's a level of waste fraud abuse and really just giveaway of our taxpayer money and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=22.96s)]
*  Sean that's what the remembering it is your money our money [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=29.56s)]
*  That's actually being used for purposes that most Americans had no idea [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=32.64s)]
*  It was being used for much of this in an opaque manner by the administrative state that has no [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=36.76s)]
*  Accountability attached to it. So sunlight is the best disinfectant [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=42.8s)]
*  Let's see what those payments are for turns out most Americans don't support them [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  And I think President Trump is on the right side to finally cut that off and make sure that our taxpayer money is better used [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  To advance the interests of our own citizens in this country [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=57.92s)]
*  I would be really negligent and my audience would be really mad if I didn't ask for your reaction to all of last night. I [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=60.92s)]
*  Think it was excellent. I mean President Trump hit it out of the park [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=69.72s)]
*  You saw the Democratic Party's reaction that is a party lost in the wilderness [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=72.48s)]
*  They are yet to find their way [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=77.28s)]
*  One of their congressmen was literally lost in the wilderness as they guided him out [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=78.76s)]
*  But I thought that was really President Trump at his best and that's a high bar right there [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=82.48s)]
*  I had the chance to spend time with President Trump over the weekend [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=87.28s)]
*  He is as confident and as well settled as he's ever been and for good reason [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=90.32s)]
*  Look at what he's accomplished in a matter of weeks in six weeks [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=95.16s)]
*  Having done more than President Biden was able to accomplish in four years [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=99.24s)]
*  I think he's well on his way to leading us into this new golden age for America [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=103.08s)]
*  This is just the warm-up back that we've seen so far [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=108.72s)]
*  I think he was also very honest Sean and this is the part I appreciated [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=111.56s)]
*  That it's not just gonna be all roses at every step of the way [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=114.96s)]
*  Sometimes the path to greatness runs through some bumpy roads [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=118.24s)]
*  He was very candid about that and yet at the same time [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=121.84s)]
*  Instilled a confidence in everybody else that I know that he has [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  That America's best days are still going to be ahead of us and I think it was a beautiful speech [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=129.28s)]
*  Oh the golden era as he said in America's back as he said the one thing that I have a sense of urgency about is that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=133.24s)]
*  Republicans in the House and Senate get their act together and they get it together fast and they implement [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=141.12s)]
*  the president's economic policies and energy policies on top of border policies and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=146.96s)]
*  Rebuild the next generation of weaponry [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=152.76s)]
*  But more importantly get this economic plan in place so recovery can happen quickly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=155.42s)]
*  I think that is very critical, especially heading into the 26 midterms, which Republicans should be thinking about [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=160.64s)]
*  Absolutely, and I think economic growth is our way back to greatness [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=167.44s)]
*  President Trump is leading us in the right direction now [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=171.84s)]
*  It's time for Congress both houses to step on the gas to help fuel us to lead us there and speaking of fuel [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=174.64s)]
*  Speaking of stepping on the gas that means it drill baby drill frack [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=181.04s)]
*  Maybe frack get our own natural resources out of the ground and use them to not only bring down costs [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=184.56s)]
*  Including energy costs but to fuel our economy back to greatness in terms of the economy [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=191.12s)]
*  Back to greatness increase the supply of everything that brings down costs [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=196.16s)]
*  It spawns actual economic growth and I do think that's gonna lift up everybody including Democrats [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  All right, Vivek Ramaswamy. We're gonna follow your campaign very closely [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOarrjD8Ljk&t=206.68s)]
