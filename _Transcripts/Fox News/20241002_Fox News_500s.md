# Melania Trump: The media is afraid of my husband's strength
**Fox News:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI)
*  Now yesterday I sat down with former First Lady Melania Trump to discuss her [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=0.0s)]
*  new memoir called Melania. We spoke about the upcoming election, the importance of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  this race and the lawfare that is being used against her husband, her family. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Here's part one of that interview. Take a look. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=16.0s)]
*  Madam First Lady, it's great to see you again. Nice to see you too. Thank you for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=19.0s)]
*  doing this. You don't love media interviews and I don't blame you because [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=23.16s)]
*  I watch a lot of media too and I'm a part of it for 35 years. We are grateful [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=27.6s)]
*  that you're here. Thank you for doing this. Thank you. So with 34 days away from [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  an election, it is, I've covered politics my whole life, it is a long, hard, tough, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=37.52s)]
*  grueling process as you know. What's this process like for you? As you said it's a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  long process and you just need to be in it and enjoy it as much as you can. Also [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=54.88s)]
*  you need to be very focused and take it day by day. Some surprises come as well [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=62.32s)]
*  so it is very important that you prepare for those surprises. What's Election Day [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=69.44s)]
*  and Election Night like for you? I'm sure if I was on the ballot I would imagine [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=76.6s)]
*  I'd probably be a wreck. Well as I explained in my book, I'm very calm. That's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=81.92s)]
*  maybe my personality and because I know on the Election Day it's all in the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  people's hands. People decide what they want for this country and it will be [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=96.0s)]
*  again this year on November 5th. Yeah, here we go again, your third run. You know [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=102.72s)]
*  one of the most interesting stories to me is when, and I've known your husband [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=108.72000000000001s)]
*  for many years, long before he ever got into politics and then when he was [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  thinking about it we had a lot of late night conversations about issues and we [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  would kind of go back and forth and debate and what's so fascinating is that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  he was going up against 16 of the top governors and senators in our country and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=129.56s)]
*  when he brought the issue to you that he was thinking of running, your quota to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=136.2s)]
*  say, well you know if you run you're going to win. True story? True story. How [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=142.04s)]
*  did you know? I saw how people reacts to him and he's a passion for this country [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  and we travel all around the world and he was making speeches at that time and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=158.84s)]
*  I saw what the people want and I think the country was ready for change. They [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  wanted to have somebody who was not in politics politics all the time and I saw [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=173.6s)]
*  it. I saw in him as well that he really wants to do it at that time. He was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=181.6s)]
*  talking for many many years but he really felt 2016 was the right time. What [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=188.16s)]
*  if anything is different this time around? I would think that the world and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=195.92s)]
*  especially United States is more divided than ever before. We are dealing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  with much more danger and especially we see what's going on on the world and the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=213.48s)]
*  threats that we get and my husband what he went through in the last few months. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=221.72s)]
*  Yeah I'm gonna get to the issue of the assassination and there are new [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=228.2s)]
*  threats as you know and we'll talk about that. Let's talk about the divided [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=233.0s)]
*  country and you often talk about you want the country united. I like the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=238.04s)]
*  country united. Some people wouldn't believe it but I have very strong [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=244.04s)]
*  political beliefs about what the right thing to do is to get the country on the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=247.64s)]
*  right track. Putting politics aside. How do you reconcile those that want open [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=252.0s)]
*  borders and those that want secure borders? Those that want high taxes and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  those that want tax cuts in a free market economy? How do you reconcile those that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=263.08s)]
*  want to defund and dismantle the police and those that believe in law and order [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=267.64s)]
*  or those that believe in energy independence and those that don't or [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  those that believe in peace through strength and those that for example [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  Kamala Harris doesn't think we should use the words radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=280.8s)]
*  How do you reconcile such differing views in your view and be united as you [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=284.56s)]
*  want it like you talk about? I think we need to listen each other. I think we [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=289.56s)]
*  need to have we have different perspectives. We have different beliefs. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=295.0s)]
*  We need to respect our freedom of speech, our individuality. I think it's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=301.52s)]
*  very important that ideas are heard. That we have a very very straightforward [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=315.12s)]
*  communications and we share the idea. We debate because I think with that we [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=324.72s)]
*  could have innovation and success in this country. I feel it's a troubling [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=331.88s)]
*  trade in this country that we are canceling people that they don't agree [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=339.96s)]
*  on certain issues. I want to talk to you about you've been a victim of cancel [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=347.0s)]
*  culture in ways that I never knew about and I want to get to that too in the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=352.24s)]
*  course of this interview. Politics though has gotten pretty rough and tumble and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  again having done this for three to over three decades look at what you and your [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=365.92s)]
*  family have had to go through. I covered the Russia as your as the president [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=372.0s)]
*  would say the Russia hoax Russia Russia Russia right? Three years it was all [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=377.12s)]
*  based on a lie and it was debunked. I watched him not to go through not one [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=381.6s)]
*  but two impeachments. We'll get to the assassination attempts. He's been through [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=388.92s)]
*  so much but so have you and what stunned me is when you actually said that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=394.88s)]
*  when they first impeached him I'm surprised it took so long. Wow you were [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=402.36s)]
*  expecting it all. I did because I saw how they treat him how the media was [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=409.52s)]
*  against him. I think they are afraid of his strength and he was leading this [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=417.44s)]
*  country with peace through strength so as soon he announced that he's running [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=423.6s)]
*  for the president everything really changed and I saw it and I said you know [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=431.88s)]
*  this will not be very pleasant but I knew what he's in into it what he will [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=438.6s)]
*  need to deal with and as soon he announced a presidency and then when he [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=449.6s)]
*  won they start already talking about the impeachment the opposition newspaper [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=455.64000000000004s)]
*  had the front page story impeachment is starting so I always said to him what is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  next so it's in one way you're not surprised and every event that it [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm thinking what is next what they are trying to do and you always fear the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=477.24s)]
*  worst and that it happened. Hey Sean Hannity here hey click here to subscribe [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4oG8jonxI&t=485.04s)]
