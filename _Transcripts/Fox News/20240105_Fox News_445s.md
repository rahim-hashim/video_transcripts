# ‘SO DIRE’: White House reportedly considering a ‘morale booster’ party
**Fox News:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I)
*  Now, things are so dire in the Biden White House that the administration is now reportedly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=0.0s)]
*  throwing a morale booster party for the staff amid more backlash over their Israel policy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=5.48s)]
*  According to Politico, a new anonymous letter penned by campaign staffers renewed calls [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=11.72s)]
*  for, quote, a ceasefire. The letter said, in part, quote, Biden for president staff [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=16.92s)]
*  have seen volunteers quit in droves. But it's not just campaign staff who are upset. A second [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=22.56s)]
*  administration official, this time from the Department of Education, has now resigned over [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=28.68s)]
*  Biden's response to the war in Israel. And outside of his own staff, the sentiment? Well, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  it's not much better as he continues to feel the heat not only from radical squad members, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=38.36s)]
*  but Democratic allies as well. Here with reaction outnumbered co-host Kayleigh McEnany, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=43.56s)]
*  Fox News contributor Lisa Booth. Did you ever need a morale booster party in the Trump White House, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Kayleigh? I never heard of one. Maybe it did happen. I have no idea. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=54.6s)]
*  No, we never had a morale boosting party because we had a president who stands on principle. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=58.76s)]
*  President Trump, you knew what he stood for. Take it or leave it, what he said he was going to do. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=65.4s)]
*  He actually did promises made, promises kept. But with Biden, he has no principle. It's all [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=69.24s)]
*  about partisanship. If he had principle, he'd stand with Israel. He wouldn't cause them to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=75.32s)]
*  reverse their military strategy, especially as we entered this month, Kefir Bebas's first birthday. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=79.48s)]
*  He celebrates his first birthday as a hostage, the youngest Israeli hostage. No, instead, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=85.4s)]
*  he's halfway with Israel, halfway with the progressive left, and the progressives, they won't have it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  So Lisa, you have in November 400 government officials, 40 departments and agencies within [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  the administration signing a letter opposing the president's handling of the war, demanding a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  ceasefire. This is right after Israel was hit with the worst terror attack in their history. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  If you extrapolate out their population versus our population, it would have been the equivalent [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=113.96s)]
*  of 40,000 Americans being killed in a single day. How would America react to being lectured [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  by other countries and allied countries about a ceasefire rather than encouraging them to go win [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=126.6s)]
*  the war against those people that killed their innocent citizens? Where's the moral clarity [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=133.48s)]
*  disconnect here? Well, I think we would give them the middle finger and tell them to go [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=138.92s)]
*  pound stand. But, you know, yeah, I mean, you look at this party. Maybe we would. I don't know if [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=143.16s)]
*  Joe Biden would. That's the problem. Yeah, actually, that's a good point. But, you know, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=147.96s)]
*  who would want to go to this party, to a party where everyone is fighting? Because that's what's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=151.96s)]
*  happening for Joe Biden or Joe Biden right now. I mean, you just laid out the mutiny from staff [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=156.92s)]
*  that he's facing that letter the other day from 17 campaign staffers present, hundreds of staffers [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=161.8s)]
*  last month signed onto a letter, hundreds of alumni as well. Even interns are writing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=167.88s)]
*  letters complaining to Joe Biden about his stance on the Middle East. And then he also is facing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=173.32s)]
*  this divide among the Democrat electorate as well. There is this New York Times Sienna poll last [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=178.2s)]
*  month showing that the Democrat voters are pretty evenly divided on whether they support Israel [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=183.72s)]
*  or they support Palestine, which is a really sad reflection and a sad declaration of where the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=188.76s)]
*  Democrat party is today, where they are willing to stand with Hamas and Hamas's sympathizers [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=194.6s)]
*  over innocent Israelis who were slaughtered in a terror attack. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=200.44s)]
*  You know, let's look at their strategy. I don't see any one policy, Kayleigh, that Joe can run on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=204.12s)]
*  and say he's been successful at. I don't care if it's foreign policy. Things aren't looking too [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=208.84s)]
*  good in Europe. Things aren't looking good with this new axis of evil, Russia, China and Iran. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=213.48s)]
*  I don't particularly like what's happening around the world. I don't like what's going on in the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=220.84s)]
*  Middle East. I think basically China has bullied Biden and gotten away with everything. The question [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=224.28s)]
*  is, will their strategy of only talking about Trump, January 6th and demagoguing abortion [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=231.4s)]
*  and then calling Republicans racist and every other name, will that be enough for them to win a campaign? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=238.44s)]
*  It's hard to imagine that it will be. I mean, Sean, I worked on a presidential campaign for [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=246.2s)]
*  President Trump, and I remember as he's announcing he's an incumbent president, ready to run again, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=250.84s)]
*  we sat back as a campaign. What do we have to tout? We have record low unemployment. We have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=256.6s)]
*  wage gains for Black Americans, Hispanic Americans. You know, we have a soaring economy, and this was [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=262.12s)]
*  before COVID hit, of course, which changed a lot of things. But we had a ton. The Supreme Court, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=267.64s)]
*  immigration, the border under control, the world peaceful, no war started under President Trump, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=273.16s)]
*  Russia not redrawing the map. We had more than enough to run on. Joe Biden, it is very telling [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=278.04s)]
*  that tomorrow his entire strategy will be January 6th. It is telling that before the midterms, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  his strategy was a blood red MAGA speech. If you are a MAGA individual, you're a clear and present [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=291.16s)]
*  danger were his words. That is the strategy. Now, mildly successful in the midterms, but you can [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=296.6s)]
*  argue there were bad candidates on the Republican side and Biden wasn't on the ballot. I don't think [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  it works when Biden's on the ballot vis-a-vis President Trump with the record that he had [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=306.52s)]
*  as president. Lisa, I'm making the case as often as I can that conservatives and Republicans, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=311.4s)]
*  if they want to win elections, they better get over their reluctance and resistance to voting [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  early and voting by mail. I am telling the Republicans they better get in the legal ballot [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=321.56s)]
*  harvesting efforts and match the efforts of the Democratic Party. I'm also saying that they better [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=326.84s)]
*  be very careful and not go too radical and extreme on abortion because Democrats, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=333.08s)]
*  even if they're not extreme, will be demagoguing that issue, trying to scare [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=339.08s)]
*  independent voters, female voters into believing that Republicans want to take away their right to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=345.0s)]
*  an abortion. No, they don't want abortion without any restrictions at all, which is the extreme [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=349.96s)]
*  Democratic Party platform. Well, you know, Sean, look what they're trying to do. They're trying [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=356.36s)]
*  to get all these abortion ballot measures on the ballot in swing states. So they're already trying [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=361.32s)]
*  to push that plan. You know, here, I pray that this is a good election cycle for Republicans. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=366.76s)]
*  If it's Donald Trump, I hope he wins. But even with all of that, all the headwinds going in, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=372.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's favor in 2020, look what they did. They used COVID to append the election. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=376.92s)]
*  That's what Democrats do. They try to win by hook or by crook. So we don't know what they're going [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=382.2s)]
*  to try to do this election cycle. They even had 51 former Intel officers lie to the American people [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=386.6s)]
*  with no shame, lying about Hunter Biden's laptop. I mean, these people are evil. They're going to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=392.6s)]
*  try to win doing anything they can. And look, I've worked on a lot of campaigns over the years. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  It is hard to change the dynamics of the race now with mail-in balloting. I mean, look at Pennsylvania. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=402.12s)]
*  Well, they're trying to mitigate, you know, the Hunter Biden, no experience, addicted to drugs, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=408.68s)]
*  Joe Biden taking professional action as vice president to help his son make a lot of money. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=414.68s)]
*  Oh, that's the same as Donald Trump's hotel having guests from foreign countries. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=420.2s)]
*  Okay. I don't see the comparison. Anyway, thank you both. Happy New Year. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  Lisa, good to see you. Kayleigh, Happy New Year to you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUy9uvMTr9I&t=430.36s)]
