# Alina Habba: This case is falling apart
**Fox News:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM)
*  Anyway, here with reaction is Trump legal spokesperson Alina Habba. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=0.0s)]
*  Alina, you know, I've never seen anything like this in my life. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=4.16s)]
*  I've never seen a corrupt judge like this, compromise like this, should have recused [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=8.36s)]
*  himself like this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=12.76s)]
*  I've never seen him work soâ€”over time, any judge, to keep out pertinent information [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=13.92s)]
*  regarding the law in a court of law before a jury that's supposed to weigh in on the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=19.8s)]
*  law. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=25.84s)]
*  That's right, Sean. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=27.28s)]
*  Let's not forget that the prosecutors have obviously had exculpatory evidence not brought [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=29.04s)]
*  out in the grand jury. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=34.84s)]
*  That's where this all started. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=36.12s)]
*  They would not have had that indictment, in my opinion, without bringing out that exculpatory [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  evidence. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=41.68s)]
*  We wouldn't be here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=42.68s)]
*  So it starts from the root. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=43.68s)]
*  And then you have Judge Mershon, who should have recused himself. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=44.68s)]
*  Judge Mershon, who I want the American people to remember very astutely, has somehow randomly [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=48.36s)]
*  selected had Steve Bannon's case, had Allen Weisselberg's case, and now put Allen Weisselberg [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=53.88s)]
*  back in jail. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  OK? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=61.64s)]
*  This is what we're dealing with. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=62.64s)]
*  Somehow he randomly also gets Donald Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=63.64s)]
*  That's not the way the system works. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=66.08s)]
*  You assign a case randomly. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=67.92s)]
*  That's the way it's supposed to work. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=70.08s)]
*  But in the new America, under the Biden regime, we are sitting here in a politicization of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=71.64s)]
*  all our judicial systems. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  He is intentionally obstructing the defense's case. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=78.2s)]
*  There is no point. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=81.72s)]
*  In no point in us even putting on a defense when you have a judge who is sitting there [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=83.18s)]
*  telling the jury, don't listen to them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=87.34s)]
*  I'm going to scream. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=89.54s)]
*  I'm going to even tell the press that they can't sit in there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=90.54s)]
*  And God knows the press is tough on me, but I had their back in this one. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=93.9s)]
*  They had no business kicking them out. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=97.2s)]
*  And that judge is so crooked that he couldn't stand that there was bad evidence being brought [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=99.18s)]
*  in by this attorney who happened to work for the SDNY, let's not forget, who has a great [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=103.86000000000001s)]
*  stellar reputation, as you mentioned. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=109.58000000000001s)]
*  But the judge lost his cool. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=111.78s)]
*  He lost his cool on Monday, and he lost his cool again today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=113.42s)]
*  So it's time to wrap this case up, throw it out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=116.88s)]
*  If this judge wants any credibility back, that's what he should do. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=119.7s)]
*  There should have been a directed verdict. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=123.2s)]
*  There should have been a mistrial. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=124.84s)]
*  I know you put in a motion to dismiss. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=127.72s)]
*  I know you wanted a directed verdict, but it's never going to happen with the Biden [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=129.54s)]
*  donor judge. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=133.38s)]
*  It's never going to happen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=134.38s)]
*  And jury instructions, I'm guessing, are not going to be exactly what would be fair [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=135.98s)]
*  and just and right for any defendant in a court of law. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=141.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=146.38000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=147.38000000000002s)]
*  We heard a little bit about that today, Sean. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=148.38000000000002s)]
*  The judge indicated that, you know, we heard the famous words that we always hear from [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=149.38s)]
*  all of the liberal alleged attorneys that are doing what they're ethically supposed [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  to. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  No one is above the law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  I always challenge them on this one thing, Sean. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  If no one is above the law, I want you to explain to me how Hunter Biden is walking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=161.46s)]
*  around right now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  I want you to explain to me how Hillary Clinton, who actually did what they're accusing Trump [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  of doing with the Russia hoax and had FEC violations, is above the law, how the Sokcho [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=170.5s)]
*  case is above the law. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=175.98s)]
*  How is all that OK? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=177.56s)]
*  But if your last name is Trump, no, no, no, no, the laws will be bent. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=179.06s)]
*  They will be broken and then they'll pretend they're martyrs. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=182.5s)]
*  It's really a disgrace what I'm seeing in the court. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=186.02s)]
*  And I'm hoping this jury sees it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=188.18s)]
*  I have, you know, very little hope in the state of New York, as you've seen, but that's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=189.62s)]
*  why they brought it here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=193.84s)]
*  This is completely political. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=195.02s)]
*  It's to keep him off the campaign. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=196.44s)]
*  And unfortunately for them, the polls are speaking for themselves. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=198.45999999999998s)]
*  The American people get what's going on here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=201.26s)]
*  Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  OK, I'll give them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  That's boilerplate. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=211.22s)]
*  Fine. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=212.22s)]
*  I'll take that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=213.22s)]
*  This is not boilerplate when it's a former president, his residence, his wife, his kid, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=214.42s)]
*  and the president didn't deny them access before. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=219.7s)]
*  Why was that directive given? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  Why wasn't there proper consideration of perspective given in this case? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=225.62s)]
*  Yeah, but Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, who has documents in his garage and was not the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  president, didn't have presidential immunity. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=237.9s)]
*  There was no directive there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  And it's disgusting. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=242.1s)]
*  President Trump in that case was cooperating, as we know, as I know, and he was doing what [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=243.84s)]
*  he needed to do. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=249.02s)]
*  You want another paddle, you want another lock on the door, here's another lock on the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=250.02s)]
*  door. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=253.1s)]
*  And then they come in and they do it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=254.1s)]
*  This is all a show. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=255.82s)]
*  President Trump has said it a million times. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=257.42s)]
*  This is the Biden-Trump show trial after show trial. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=259.02s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=261.64s)]
*  They're falling apart from Fannie to Florida to this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=262.64s)]
*  It's falling apart. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=266.42s)]
*  Let's hope so. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=268.98s)]
*  We'll know soon. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=269.98s)]
*  Thank you, Alina. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVCTUY6B3dM&t=270.98s)]
