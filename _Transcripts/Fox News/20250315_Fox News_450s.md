# Trump pierced the myth the DOJ operates independently, Gregg Jarrett says
**Fox News:** [March 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs)
*  Anyway, here with reaction, Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, Harvard law professor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=0.0s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz is with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=4.0s)]
*  The president just spoke, Greg, about corruption, weaponization. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=7.22s)]
*  It became the Department of Injustice. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=13.08s)]
*  Think about this for a second, because both of you and a few others, not many, were on [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=15.6s)]
*  this show regularly talking about the Russia hoax, talking about FISA abuse, talking about [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=21.14s)]
*  a dual system of justice, talking about, you know, this novel legal theory that they used [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=27.419999999999998s)]
*  in New York, talking about all the injustice. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=33.3s)]
*  And there he is in the building where all the plotting and planning and scheming took [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=36.62s)]
*  place. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=40.7s)]
*  I kind of took that in. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=42.1s)]
*  And, you know, things worked out, but it was perilously close to the line where I think [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=43.66s)]
*  it was a line of no return. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=50.86s)]
*  Greg? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=53.099999999999994s)]
*  You know, what the president did today was important because it pierced this myth that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=55.699999999999996s)]
*  the Justice Department operates independently. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=61.62s)]
*  That's a fiction. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=64.78s)]
*  It is found nowhere in the Constitution. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=65.78s)]
*  Indeed, the opposite is true. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=67.86s)]
*  Article 2, the executive branch designed to be unitary. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=70.42s)]
*  The president is the sole head of all agencies and departments, Sean, including the Department [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=75.2s)]
*  of Justice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  He hires, fires, directs what they do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=82.25999999999999s)]
*  They operate within the presidential sphere. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=84.8s)]
*  That's in the opinion clause, the appointments clause. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=88.72s)]
*  It makes all of them subordinate, answerable to the president. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  Yet, you know, we have seen this false paradigm of, oh, the DOJ is independent. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=95.64s)]
*  Take hold. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=102.2s)]
*  It is not. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=103.2s)]
*  So today, Donald Trump reasserted his authority, his leadership, no more weaponization of the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=104.36s)]
*  law for political gain or vendettas, and refocus on crime and safety, law and order. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=109.96s)]
*  I think Americans are cheering that it's about time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=117.28s)]
*  You know, when you look at where he was, this is the very building, Professor, as I said, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=122.44s)]
*  where they were plotting and planning and scheming his destruction. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=128.44s)]
*  They wanted to destroy this man, get Trump, as theyâ€”I think somebody wrote a famous [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=132.76s)]
*  book called that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=137.12s)]
*  And when you think about it, he goes to that building. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=139.32s)]
*  Would it be weaponization to look into the people that worked in that building and what [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=143.48s)]
*  they were up to, and whether or not they were following Justice Department protocol, whether [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=149.16s)]
*  or not they violated the law, whether or not, show me the man and I'll find you the crime? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=156.12s)]
*  I mean, is that what went on there? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=163.76s)]
*  Would they be within their rights to look deeply and see how corrupted that agency became [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=166.02s)]
*  under Joe Biden and Merrick Garland? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, not only they looking into it, but Congress as well. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=172.62s)]
*  The motto of the Justice Department is equal justice. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=178.18s)]
*  And for the last four years, we have not seen equal justice. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=182.02s)]
*  We've seen the application of a double standard. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  We're seeing the application of a double standard all over the country today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=187.74s)]
*  Take, for example, there were big demonstrations at Harvard and other universities on behalf [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=191.98s)]
*  of the free speech rights, the free speech rights of this anti-Semitic pro-Hamas thug. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=196.96s)]
*  Very few of the professors who were chanting and cheering for free speech would do it if [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=204.22s)]
*  the person who was being deported was a conservative, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, a racist, a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=209.78s)]
*  right-winger, somebody who didn't fit their political narrative and political ideology. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=214.82s)]
*  The key to justice is a single standard. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  And if President Trump can bring about a single standard of justice, investigate wrongdoers, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=225.02s)]
*  look at people who use the double standard, but make sure you do it without reference [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=231.9s)]
*  to political parties. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=238.34s)]
*  You know, the Bible says that judges and prosecutors must never look at faces. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=239.34s)]
*  Lo takir punim is the word in the Bible. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=245.86s)]
*  Do not recognize faces. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=248.62s)]
*  It has to be equal justice. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  And I think the speech today in the Justice Department was the beginning of the end of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=253.1s)]
*  the double standard that I've been writing about, been complaining about, and will continue [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=258.18s)]
*  to complain about if it's not carried out by the Republicans. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=262.86s)]
*  And, you know, I made a speech in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=265.98s)]
*  President Trump was there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=268.42s)]
*  And I looked at him and I said, please, don't do what they did to you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=269.78s)]
*  Don't apply a double standard. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=274.82s)]
*  And he shook his head in agreement. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=276.42s)]
*  And that really made me happy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=278.5s)]
*  Would they be within their, would it be the right thing to do, both Congress and the Justice [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=281.7s)]
*  Department, Greg, to look into the people and to see if they abuse power for political [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=286.98s)]
*  purposes to take down Donald Trump? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=292.78s)]
*  Oh, it absolutely would. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=295.5s)]
*  And we're just now inevitably learning about the ugly, illicit schemes that were used to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=298.62s)]
*  target Donald Trump by the Department of Justice and the FBI. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=305.86s)]
*  You know, part of the things we've learned over the last several days is that Biden's [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=311.42s)]
*  aides in the White House were handing over Trump and Mike Pence's cell phones. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=317.06s)]
*  We already know that Biden leaked purposely to the media his demand that Merrick Garland [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=322.54s)]
*  prosecute his political opponent, Donald Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, those people who broke the law, who violated standards, who were weaponizing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=334.02s)]
*  their power and position for political purposes and vendetta should not only be held accountable [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=340.54s)]
*  publicly, but in a court of law, if they broke laws. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=347.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=352.34s)]
*  All right, Professor. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=353.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=354.34s)]
*  No more getting anybody. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=355.34s)]
*  I think we all agree on that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  Professor, you get the last word. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=357.86s)]
*  Agree. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=359.7s)]
*  Well, look, I think we're on the right track. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=360.7s)]
*  I think Pam Bondi has extraordinary experience. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=364.06s)]
*  She's tough. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=366.46s)]
*  She has the right priorities. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=367.46s)]
*  We can't have presidents of universities saying it broke my heart to see them invade the room [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=369.62s)]
*  of a student. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=375.14s)]
*  Did it break her heart when they went into Mar-a-Lago? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=376.14s)]
*  When they went into other places? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=379.1s)]
*  You know, you can't be heartbroken just when one side is attacked, but not the other. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=381.02s)]
*  So we have a deeper problem than the Justice Department. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=386.7s)]
*  Our problem is deep within the academy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=389.46s)]
*  We have to root out the double standard that is applicable today in the academy, in the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=391.74s)]
*  justice system, literally all over the country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  And I saw today's speech as a good beginning. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=399.66s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=403.3s)]
*  Defund any institution that is allowing this type of prejudice, hatred, discrimination [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=404.3s)]
*  on their college campuses. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=413.14s)]
*  That'll be effective. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=414.62s)]
*  But don't go after medical research. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=415.62s)]
*  Go after the villains, the bad guys, not medical research. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=419.1s)]
*  Okay, I'm talking about the funding, until they have endowments that will last for hundreds [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=422.38s)]
*  of years. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=427.14000000000004s)]
*  No, I'm saying, but you have to make sure that the funding is targeted. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=428.14000000000004s)]
*  The funding is targeted, and so it doesn't impact medical research and good things that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=430.5s)]
*  are happening. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=434.98s)]
*  That's important too, and I think it will happen. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bUGiJfQzqs&t=435.98s)]
