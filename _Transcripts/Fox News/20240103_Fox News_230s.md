*  And later, I do have bad news for Jon Stewart, formerly of The Daily Show, who once begged [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=40.56s)]
*  me, along with the Jersey Boys and Nathan Lane, to stay in New York. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  You might remember. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=50.66s)]

*  New York has made a lot of big mistakes, but we're going to change. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=60.4s)]
*  Just please, stay. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=63.92s)]
*  And they actually sing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, now that I have officially moved to the free state of Florida, my new permanent [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  residence, I don't know, will Jon Stewart, the Jersey Boys, Nathan Lane ever survive? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=72.96s)]
*  Jimmy Fallon is here tonight to respond. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=79.6s)]
*  But first, we turn back to our top story, the ultra-wealthy convicted pedophile Jeffrey [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=81.24s)]
*  Epstein we know is dead, but he leaves behind what is a long trail of high-profile associates [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=86.08s)]
*  and friends, including many who knew about or may have participated in his massive web [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=91.72s)]
*  of sexual abuse. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=97.52s)]
*  To date, no one other than Epstein and his partner, Jelaine Maxwell, have ever been charged [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=98.6s)]
*  or convicted in connection with their, quote, underage sex trafficking ring and allegations. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=104.68s)]
*  But tonight, a court has just unsealed a list of names in a civil suit. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=110.42s)]
*  This one brought by one of Epstein's alleged victims. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  Now before we get to the names and the allegations, here is a quick reminder. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=118.7s)]
*  For decades, Jeffrey Epstein was shrouded in mystery. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=122.82s)]
*  He was once regarded as a billionaire investor. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=126.14s)]
*  No one seemed to know how Epstein became so wealthy and so well-connected. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=129.44s)]
*  He owned multiple private planes, a fleet of cars, several massive estates all across [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=133.38s)]
*  the country, including what was the largest home right there in New York City. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=138.64s)]
*  Epstein even had his very own private island named, quote, Little St. James. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=143.9s)]
*  Now today, many of you know it as, quote, Pedophile Island, based on numerous allegations [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=148.46s)]
*  that young girls were trafficked to Epstein's island and that they were, in fact, abused. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=154.66s)]
*  There were also abused allegations, according to many, at his Palm Beach mansion, his home [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  in New York, his sprawling ranch in New Mexico, and his luxury apartment in Paris in France. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=166.06s)]
*  At the very same time, Epstein hung out with some of the most well-connected people on [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=171.86s)]
*  Earth, including billionaires, actors, world leaders. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=176.58s)]
*  And according to flight logs, former President Bill Clinton took nearly two dozen flights [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  on Epstein's private planes, including the jet that came to be known as the Lolita Express. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=185.66000000000003s)]
*  And tonight's unsealed documents do mention the former president, including this exchange [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=192.22000000000003s)]
*  with one of Epstein's victims, quote, Epstein said that one time, Clinton liked them young, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=196.74s)]
*  referring to girls. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=203.02s)]
*  Now keep in mind these are allegations. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=204.58s)]
*  It's from a civil suit, and that was a suit that was settled and have not been proven [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=206.18s)]
*  in a court of law. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=210.62s)]
*  Former President Clinton has denied any wrongdoing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=211.74s)]
*  Now of course, Clinton is not the only high-profile name released tonight. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rJrMLLwbI&t=213.70000000000002s)]
