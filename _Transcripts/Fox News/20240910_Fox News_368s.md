# Kamala Harris didnâ€™t get fact-checked a single time: RFK, Jr.
**Fox News:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc)
*  All right, one issue that did get a lot of attention from ABC's far-left moderators was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=0.0s)]
*  the weaponization of our Department of Justice. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=4.8s)]
*  Donald Trump still made it a point of emphasis. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=7.74s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=10.68s)]
*  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America Every one of those cases was started [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=11.68s)]
*  by them against their political opponent. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=14.42s)]
*  And I'm winning most of them, and I will win the rest on appeal. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  And you saw that with the decision that came down just recently from the Supreme Court. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=20.32s)]
*  I'm winning most of them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=24.32s)]
*  But those are cases. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=25.68s)]
*  It's called weaponization. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=26.86s)]
*  Never happened in this country. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=28.36s)]
*  They weaponized the Justice Department. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=30.16s)]
*  Every one of those cases was involved with the DOJ, from Atlanta and Fonny Willis to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=32.58s)]
*  the attorney general of New York and the DA in New York. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Every one of those cases. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=42.94s)]
*  And then they say, oh, he was, he's a criminal. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=44.64s)]
*  They're the ones that made them go after me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=48.36s)]
*  It's weaponization, and they used it, and it's never happened in this country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=51.46s)]
*  They used it to try and win an election. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=55.4s)]
*  They're fake cases. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=57.92s)]
*  All right, joining us now, someone who knows firsthand about the weaponization of justice, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=58.92s)]
*  live from the spin room, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=65.08s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=67.0s)]
*  How are you? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=68.0s)]
*  Good to see you, Sean. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=69.0s)]
*  You left your party, a party that was near and dear to your father, to your uncle. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=70.0s)]
*  I think it has no resemblance to the Democratic Party today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=77.72s)]
*  This is the frustrating part about tonight, the radicalization, the views stated by Kamala. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=83.36s)]
*  They weren't asked by the moderators. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=90.04s)]
*  To me, it was a failed opportunity. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=92.08s)]
*  I think the American people were failed tonight. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=94.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was disappointed by the evident bias of the moderators, who were fact-checking [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=96.04s)]
*  constantly, kind of trivialities by President Trump, but didn't, as far as I saw, they didn't [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=102.4s)]
*  fact-check Vice President Harris a single time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=109.4s)]
*  You're right, Sean. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=113.44s)]
*  The party that I grew up in doesn't exist anymore. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=114.44s)]
*  The party of Robert Kennedy and John Kennedy was a party of peace. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=116.4s)]
*  It was the party of resistance, the corporate subversion of American democracy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=119.6s)]
*  It was the party of civil rights and constitutional rights, particularly censorship, very opposed [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=125.2s)]
*  to censorship and surveillance. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=130.68s)]
*  It was the party of protecting the most vulnerable people in our society, including particularly [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=133.12s)]
*  children. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=141.64s)]
*  Today, the Democratic Party is the party of war. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=142.64s)]
*  It's the party of censorship. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  It's the party of surveillance. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  We saw Iqchini and John Bolton endorse, along with 255 neocons, endorse Vice President Harris [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  this week. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=161.16s)]
*  They came out of exile, where they were sent after the Patriot Act. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=162.76s)]
*  They were sent after the war in Iraq, the biggest foreign policy debacle in American [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=166.48s)]
*  history. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=170.92s)]
*  And they're not endorsing Vice President Harris, because they've changed their minds. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=172.44s)]
*  They're endorsing her because she represents their worldview, more censorship, more war, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=179.4s)]
*  more surveillance, and less liberty and constitutional rights. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=184.24s)]
*  You know a lot in the course of your campaign. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=187.48s)]
*  They talk about democracy and peril, but everything, the entire force of the Democratic establishment, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=190.04s)]
*  if you will, they just went in for the political death of your campaign. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=197.44s)]
*  They did not want you to get to first base. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=205.48s)]
*  They wanted you on the ballot. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=209.04s)]
*  As the other thing is that they've abandoned democracy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=212.04s)]
*  At the Democratic Party, it's now about centralized control. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=215.8s)]
*  It's about losing faith in the demos, the people, and about abolishing elections, abolishing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=218.72s)]
*  our ability to hear different points of view, to hear dissent. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=225.2s)]
*  In my case, of course, they got rid of the primaries. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=229.72s)]
*  They literally abolished many of the primaries so that President Biden wouldn't have to debate [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=232.44s)]
*  me, wouldn't have to run against me. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=236.64s)]
*  Let me let me dip in. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=238.8s)]
*  I guess Kamala, is that one of her watch parties or something? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=239.8s)]
*  I don't know what she's saying. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=243.24s)]
*  Let's just dip in for a second. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=244.24s)]
*  And let me just say that I think we all know that tonight was a night that highlights something [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=247.68s)]
*  that you all have been working so hard on. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=252.84s)]
*  We have folks here who have been knocking on doors. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=254.6s)]
*  Well, you know. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=257.64s)]
*  But we have a lot of work to do. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=264.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  And tonight, I think, highlighted for the American people what's at stake. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  I started the debate by talking about it and it became apparent, I think, throughout that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=270.6s)]
*  about an hour and a half. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=275.32s)]
*  So obviously she's going to go out there and her team. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=279.04s)]
*  The thing that I learned about her tonight is, you know, being hidden away for days and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  days and days on end. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=289.16s)]
*  You can learn your rehearse lines. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  And it doesn't matter if you tell the truth because she wasn't back checked. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=292.8s)]
*  She told a lot of lies about Trump in 2025, lies about mandatory gun buybacks, which she [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=295.88000000000005s)]
*  did support, lying about fracking, lying about a national abortion ban that Donald Trump [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=300.72s)]
*  doesn't support. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  You know, it's hard when you've got three on one like that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=309.48s)]
*  But that's what I expect. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=314.12s)]
*  We're now, she's been in this campaign 50 days. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=315.12s)]
*  We only have 56 days till Election Day, but early voting, for example, I've been pointing [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=317.48s)]
*  out tonight, starts right here one week from tonight. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=321.04s)]
*  There's a lot of information about her stated views and her own words that people don't [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  know about. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=329.64000000000004s)]
*  What would you advise the Trump people to do to get that out? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, you know, you were the most telling part of the debate to me. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=332.36s)]
*  She didn't get fact checked on the first question. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  Are Americans better off than they were four years ago? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  There's no metric that you can use to make that case. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=341.72s)]
*  And she was allowed to then go and give this kind of biographical sketch of herself without [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=346.72s)]
*  ever asking that question. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=352.04s)]
*  And they never demanded that she ask it today. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=353.04s)]
*  She didn't get it anywhere else. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmP4pgzbbOc&t=365.72s)]
