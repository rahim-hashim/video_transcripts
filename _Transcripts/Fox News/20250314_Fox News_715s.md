# Everything is ‘turning up Trump’: Kellyanne Conway
**Fox News:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ)
*  Here with reaction, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Kellyanne Conway, Project 21 chairman Horace Cooper. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=3.96s)]
*  Kellyanne, start with you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Thank God that rocket got up and had a successful launch today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=9.84s)]
*  We now pray for its successful return and the return of these astronauts. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=13.92s)]
*  Yes, it was the eighth consecutive week of the triumph of Donald Trump's second term, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=17.92s)]
*  and it was capped off by this amazing feat by Elon Musk. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=24.28s)]
*  So the Democrats are trying to paint him as a four-letter word. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=27.72s)]
*  They are completely obsessed with him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=31.74s)]
*  If it's not TDS, Trump Derangement Syndrome, it's EDS, Elon Derangement Syndrome. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=33.32s)]
*  And the way most Americans see Elon Musk, Sean, is what you saw tonight, which is a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=39.56s)]
*  genius, somebody who makes stuff. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=45.04s)]
*  Somebody doesn't give up the first time something fails. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=47.2s)]
*  The rocket doesn't go up the next time he goes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  It's American exceptionalism and American resilience. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=51.28s)]
*  same as somebody who's just launching, you know, we can cure diseases. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=54.92s)]
*  We can find scientific discoveries if we actually go to space responsibly. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=58.96s)]
*  But while the Democrats were obsessing over Donald Trump and Elon Musk, Donald Trump was [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  bringing peace. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=67.9s)]
*  He's trying to broker peace in Ukraine and Russia. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=69.12s)]
*  He's trying to broker peace in the Middle East and bring that remaining living American [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=71.4s)]
*  hostage, Elon Alexander, home. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=74.64s)]
*  This week we saw wholesale inflation down, the price of eggs go down, mortgage rates [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=77.8s)]
*  go down, derogate go down, consumer confidence going up. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=82.8s)]
*  Everything is turning up Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  And now the Democrats, who have had no direction since the election, they're in their fourth [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=89.56s)]
*  consecutive month. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=95.28s)]
*  They are their only answer to everything is Trump, Trump, Trump. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=96.96s)]
*  I want everybody to know what they voted against tonight. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=100.08s)]
*  Only two senators voted for this package. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=102.92s)]
*  That means the rest of them voted against more border funding and more defense funding. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=105.1s)]
*  People should know that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=110.44s)]
*  Chuck Schumer waving the white flag, crying Chuck, crying again this time and surrendering [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=111.92s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=116.12s)]
*  Sean, he did not say this, this, we're doing this for policy reasons. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=117.12s)]
*  He said, quote, the political consequences of shutting down the government are even worse [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=121.12s)]
*  for us. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=126.1s)]
*  Those people are all about politics. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=127.1s)]
*  Donald Trump is all about policies and America first principles, and he's winning it every [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=128.6s)]
*  single turn. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=133.82s)]
*  Mark, you were the first to tell me that you believe that, in fact, the CR would pass in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=134.82s)]
*  the House and in the Senate. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  After all the years the Democrats have condemned government shutdowns. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=143.64s)]
*  I'm not as afraid of a government shutdown as most people are, because most people end [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  up getting furlough and then they get back pay and they end up getting a free vacation [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=151.32s)]
*  and essential services always end up continuing anyway. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=155.76s)]
*  And they get to the they get to the end zone at some point. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  So I don't really have that fear. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=162.42s)]
*  But it is in the best interest of the country that it didn't happen. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=163.84s)]
*  Well, it is, Sean. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=168.04s)]
*  And as you and I talked several days ago, the reason why I was so confident is because [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=169.48s)]
*  the work that the president has been putting on in behind the scenes, I mean, for days [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  and days, if not weeks, he's been working with members both in the House and the Senate [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=179.72s)]
*  to actually give him the tech, the tactical flexibility to make sure that this happens. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=185.12s)]
*  Listen, there's a rocket in orbit tonight that Elon Musk sent sent up into space. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=190.2s)]
*  But there's somebody else's in orbit. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=196.72s)]
*  Most of the left have gone crazy tonight just because they think that Donald Trump and the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=198.96s)]
*  American people, I might add, are winning. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=204.84s)]
*  They they believe that it's best if you actually expand the role of government. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=207.84s)]
*  But I can tell you, the American people rejected that in November. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=213.88s)]
*  Listen, there's talk about new leadership in the Senate and in the House. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=218.0s)]
*  But it's not about their leadership, Sean. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=222.0s)]
*  It's about their ideas and their priorities. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=224.12s)]
*  It's time that we put America first. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=226.84s)]
*  Donald Trump is doing that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=228.76s)]
*  And quite frankly, tonight was a good night for America. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=230.6s)]
*  And it will be the start of a real effort over the next six months to to limit the size [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=234.44s)]
*  and growth of government. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=240.44s)]
*  Horace, to me, to follow up on Mark's point is the party has been so radicalized left. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=242.28s)]
*  If Schumer, if Hakeem Jeffries, if they want to stay empowered, they have no choice but [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=249.16s)]
*  to give in to that wing of their party, because that is almost the totality of their party. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=255.56s)]
*  Am I wrong in believing that the Schumer cancellation countdown clock is officially [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  ticking? Because I don't think he's going to be able to to thread this needle that long. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, there's no doubt that radicals have completely overtaken the world's oldest [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=272.6s)]
*  political party and they are taking it underwater and holding it for as long as they can. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=279.0s)]
*  It is devastating. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=287.8s)]
*  This has been an amazing week for America. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=289.24s)]
*  Interest rates dropped. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=292.92s)]
*  Fuel prices dropped. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=294.6s)]
*  Fuel prices dropped. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  We saw a rally come back in the stock market at the end of the week and egg prices dropped. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  And then a government continuing resolution that actually prioritizes making sure we protect our [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  borders while ensuring that we maintain the flexibility to reduce the funds that we need to. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  We as a country face a $36 trillion debt monster. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  Were it not for our president taking the lead on that, because many on the left are unwilling [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=332.12s)]
*  to stand up and be accountable. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=340.91999999999996s)]
*  Apparently a couple voted for the continuing resolution, but then it's just a question of how [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=344.2s)]
*  quickly we're going to see them get attacked by the crazies on the left. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=351.32s)]
*  They're killing their party and the only thing they seem to be able to do is kill it faster. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=358.04s)]
*  You know, you can add to that, and this has been growing and growing and growing, and the left and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=365.56s)]
*  the markets were a little skittish for the better part of the week until today, Kellyann, but [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=371.8s)]
*  there's a lot of other things that are happening that people don't want to seem to pay attention to. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=377.64s)]
*  Honda and Nissan were scheduled to build plants in Mexico. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  Now as a result of the president's policies, they're going to build those factories here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  Apple investing $500 billion in four years, they're going to build the plant that's going to be built [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=391.96s)]
*  in Texas. Then you have this Taiwanese chip company. They're going to spend over $100 billion. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=397.56s)]
*  They're going to make chips here, which is a great idea, and I think it's good for national security. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=402.52s)]
*  And I have sources telling me this is the tip of the iceberg, that there are multiple, you know, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=407.32s)]
*  companies that will be investing hundreds of billions of dollars. To me, great news, high [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  paying career jobs for Americans. That's the reason I bought a Tesla this week. They're demonizing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=419.4s)]
*  this guy. They're terrorizing his facilities, and who's going to get hurt? It's not going to be [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=424.12s)]
*  Elon Musk that they're going to hurt here, although they're threatening his life, but it's going to be [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=429.8s)]
*  the people that work for him in the dealerships. It's going to be the people that manufacture those [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=435.32s)]
*  cars. They're the ones that are going to get hurt because the radical left is so vicious. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=439.48s)]
*  What do they hate this guy for? What did he do? Oh, he beat them at their own game, and he no longer [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=444.28s)]
*  is a Democrat. He's actually trying to make government more efficient by exposing the ridiculous [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=451.0s)]
*  copious amounts of money we spend on nonsense things that are offensive and odious to many [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=456.2s)]
*  Americans, and he'll continue to do that. Sean, I'm often asked what's different about this [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=461.72s)]
*  White House. You worked in the last White House. What's different about President Trump? Let me [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=466.44000000000005s)]
*  say there are two, three external factors very quickly that are different, and this is important. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=469.32000000000005s)]
*  One is the country is more aligned with the Trump agenda. He has been elevating trade tariffs and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=473.56s)]
*  manufacturing and illegal immigration border security for years, and now the country agrees [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=479.8s)]
*  with him. All seven swing states and nationwide, number two issue last fall. Number two, his [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=484.68s)]
*  relationship with the House and Senate is extraordinary. The way he's working with them, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=489.56s)]
*  even with slimmer margins, keeping in touch with them, finding out what the holdouts need and want [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=493.72s)]
*  to get on board, trying to invite Democrats to come over and vote for good things for the people [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=498.92s)]
*  in their states and their congressional districts. And the third thing is you've got all these [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=504.36s)]
*  corporate titans lining up, begging all of us to go see President Trump. I must see President Trump. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=508.76s)]
*  I must say I'm coming to town. I must see President Trump, and they want to come with handout stretch [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=514.36s)]
*  to offer investment. We're going to get to trillions of dollars of investment expanding the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=519.16s)]
*  American footprint. America is back because there won't be the hundred corporate incursions we had [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=525.0s)]
*  last time, people parking wealth and jobs legally overseas. That all stays here now because of Tax [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  Cut and Jobs Act, DREG, energy dominance, the aforementioned DOJ, the smaller federal government [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=536.04s)]
*  footprint, and yes, trade policy. So you're going to continue to see health care companies and tech [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  companies and service and goods companies come and say to President Trump, I want to stand [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=547.64s)]
*  by your side and announce a big investment. Will you come and cut the ribbon on my new facility? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=552.76s)]
*  It's just amazing. What about, Mark, you know the ins and outs of the reconciliation process, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=557.16s)]
*  and I don't know if there's going to be one big beautiful bill or two bills, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=563.08s)]
*  but the sooner that gets done, in my view, the better it's going to be for the American people. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=567.4s)]
*  That'll help get the economy on track. We're currently living under the Biden-Harris economy. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  Houston County, Mr. Moore. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=576.44s)]
*  Yeah, just like President Trump has been working behind the scenes on the continuing resolution [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=577.4s)]
*  that passed tonight, he's been working for several months. He and his entire team have been working. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=583.1600000000001s)]
*  And yes, as we start to look at that, he's committed to make sure that most Americans [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=588.12s)]
*  do not get a tax increase. Why? Because what he has to do is act quickly. He's going to have to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=594.84s)]
*  act just with Republicans. The Democrats don't mind a tax increase going for the American people, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=601.72s)]
*  but I see that getting passed. I believe that that happens the middle of May, and so I'm very [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=608.28s)]
*  optimistic that tax cuts are on the way, not just for those that seek to do it, but also for those [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=613.72s)]
*  that are creating jobs. As Kellyanne was talking about, it is time for America First Manufacturing [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=621.64s)]
*  to come back and the president being willing to take the hard choices to make it happen. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=627.16s)]
*  And Horace, it's a misnomer. The bottom 50 percent of wage-earning Americans, they pay about 2 percent [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=633.24s)]
*  of the tax revenues into the government. We already have redistribution. There's not an unfair burden [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=640.4399999999999s)]
*  on working men and women, and Donald Trump wants to even lower that level from where it is now. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=648.12s)]
*  Last word. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=653.4s)]
*  We absolutely need an America where those who work hard, those who apply themselves, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=656.28s)]
*  those who are inventive, get the benefits for that. Donald Trump has promised America this [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=662.52s)]
*  golden age where we will return to this pro-capitalism, free market, free enterprise, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=669.24s)]
*  prosperity era. The Democrats are crazy. They can't stand it, but that's where we're going to go, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=676.6s)]
*  and if we gotta do it alone, Donald Trump apparently is willing to do so. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=684.2s)]
*  That pretty much sums it up. They're crazy. I agree. I think we all agree. We're living in crazy [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=688.6s)]
*  times, but you know what? We have an opportunity to fix and save the country from what was a [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hehrPYewpQ&t=694.36s)]
