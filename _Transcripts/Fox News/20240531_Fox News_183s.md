# Lara Trump reacts to Trump trial verdict: 'Biden did this'
**Fox News:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA)
*  All right, here with reaction to the Trump verdict, RNC co-chair Laura Trump is with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=0.0s)]
*  us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=3.92s)]
*  Laura, great to have you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=4.92s)]
*  You've been in the courtroom for a lot of this trial. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=5.92s)]
*  And you know, we had discussed it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=8.76s)]
*  We saw what was happening with the judge. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=12.16s)]
*  In that sense, I was not surprised. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=14.84s)]
*  I wish I would be surprised, but I was not. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=17.76s)]
*  I felt like once the defense gutted Michael Cohen, they gutted him on cross, from that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=20.32s)]
*  point on, the judge had to throw lifeline after lifeline after lifeline, shut down the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=27.64s)]
*  defenses, witnesses, then follow up with a temper tantrum, and then, of course, allow [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=33.04s)]
*  the prosecution to make allegation after allegation in their clothes, followed by the ridiculous, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=39.24s)]
*  you know, charge to the jury and jury instructions. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=45.52s)]
*  In that sense, it's like putting cinder blocks on the scales of justice. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=48.52s)]
*  It was obvious what was happening. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  It was so obvious. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump himself said it best. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  This is a dark day for our country, for America. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=59.959999999999994s)]
*  It truly is, Sean. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  I think it's become very clear to people there is no bottom for the Democrats at this point. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=64.88s)]
*  They're literally willing to do anything they need in order to hang on to power, even if [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=70.92s)]
*  it means destroying the very fabric of our country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=76.28s)]
*  It's exactly what they're doing right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=80.92s)]
*  And you have to think, Sean, for a second. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=83.36s)]
*  How is the rest of the world looking at America right now? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=84.92s)]
*  They see the same polling that we all see. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  They see that by every metric and in every poll, Donald Trump is beating Joe Biden. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=90.56s)]
*  They know why this is happening. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=94.6s)]
*  Yet we are supposed to be the pillar of freedom and democracy for the rest of the world to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=96.6s)]
*  look up to and look at us tonight. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=102.4s)]
*  It is shameful to see this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=105.6s)]
*  And I hope Americans are paying attention, because America, they think you are stupid. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  They think that they can pull one over on you. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=113.4s)]
*  They think they can intimidate you into voting for Joe Biden. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=115.84s)]
*  So make sure come November 5th that we prove them wrong. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  Sean, Joe Biden did this today, and people responded in such a way to our campaign and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  by donations, our entire fundraising site crashed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=129.0s)]
*  It's back up and running, donaldjtrump.com, if anybody wants to go donate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=132.76s)]
*  People were donating, Sean, not by the thousands, not by the tens of thousands, not by the hundreds [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=137.84s)]
*  of thousands, by the millions. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=142.6s)]
*  And we have thousands, I'll repeat that again for Joe Biden, thousands of people donating [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=145.28s)]
*  right now to Donald Trump who have never once ever donated to our campaign, period ever. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=150.0s)]
*  That speaks volumes about how the American people are interpreting this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=157.44s)]
*  November is coming and our verdict will officially be rendered on November 5th. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=162.36s)]
*  All right, Laura Trump, thank you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=167.16s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqBBtJ8fIA&t=169.76s)]
