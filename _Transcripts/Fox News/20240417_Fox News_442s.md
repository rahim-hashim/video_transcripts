# Sean Hannity: Biden made a fatal mistake
**Fox News:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac)
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland, he's continuing to defy a congressional subpoena and is refusing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=0.0s)]
*  to turn over the audio from Biden's special counsel deposition. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=6.32s)]
*  Garland appears willing to be held in contempt in order to shield this tape from you, from [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=10.84s)]
*  the American public. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=16.76s)]
*  Remember, this is from Biden's interview with the special counsel, Robert Herr. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=18.04s)]
*  That's the one that caused the special counsel to describe your president as, quote, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Wow, even though he willfully held on to classified information and top secret documents. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=27.68s)]
*  And yet again, Biden wants another, what, four years in office? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=38.88s)]
*  Today he was back in Pennsylvania, kind of because it's the closest battleground state [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=42.32s)]
*  to both Delaware and the White House. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=47.04s)]
*  So it's kind of an easy trip for our weak, frail, mentally, physically frail commander-in-chief. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  During a handful of lethargic campaign stops, well, Biden's mind appeared to be elsewhere. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=55.52s)]
*  There's something about Pennsylvania that leaves Joe yearning for the olden days. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  So he made the fatal mistake. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=65.76s)]
*  He went off script and treated voters to one long rambling, bubbling, mumbling story one [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=68.6s)]
*  after another. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=74.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=75.68s)]
*  I was in one of those eight by 10 bathrooms, you know, they have shower, toilet in the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=76.68s)]
*  sink. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  I got a towel on me and shaving cream and I heard bam, bam, bam at my door really loudly. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=82.32s)]
*  And when I went to hell, I thought of this guy, Bob Cunningham, a radio show and a couple [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=89.0s)]
*  other guys. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=94.16s)]
*  So I said, OK, OK, guys. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=95.16s)]
*  And I walked to the door and opened up and standing there was the former governor of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  the state of Delaware, Albert N. Carvel, a big guy, about six, five, talked at you like. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=101.16s)]
*  Did you get all that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=108.28s)]
*  Because I didn't. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=109.28s)]
*  Anyway, it didn't end there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=110.28s)]
*  We'll talk about that in a minute. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  And then later reminisced about his old Uncle Bozy, who Joe says was eaten by cannibals. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=118.28s)]
*  Was it Hannibal Lecter? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=119.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=120.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=121.28s)]
*  And my uncle, they called him Ambrose, they called him Bozy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=122.28s)]
*  My Uncle Bozy was a hell of an athlete. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=126.28s)]
*  They'd tell me when he was a kid. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=129.28s)]
*  And he became an Army Air Corps before the Air Force came along. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=131.28s)]
*  He flew those single engine planes as reconnaissance over war zones. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=135.28s)]
*  He got shot down in New Guinea. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=141.28s)]
*  And they never found the body because it used to be there are a lot of cannibals for real [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=144.28s)]
*  in that part of New Guinea. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=150.28s)]
*  Is there anybody in this audience, all of you watching, do you think that man is strong [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=153.28s)]
*  enough, is cognitively alert enough to be the president of this great country? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=160.28s)]
*  Do you really believe that? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=166.28s)]
*  And what are the accomplishments over the last four years? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=168.28s)]
*  Can you name any? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=170.28s)]
*  I can't. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=171.28s)]
*  Biden told the exact same story two times today. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=172.28s)]
*  And if he was able to stay awake past nine, not watching our show, darn it, we want everybody [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=176.28s)]
*  to watch. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=181.28s)]
*  We'd probably hear the story for a third time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=182.28s)]
*  Needless to say, Joe's trip to Pennsylvania was an utter disaster. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=184.28s)]
*  Watch more. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=188.28s)]
*  You heard me say before, Wall Street didn't build America. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=190.28s)]
*  Middle class didn't build America. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=193.28s)]
*  And you guys built the middle class. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=196.28s)]
*  You just built it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=198.28s)]
*  My mom didn't live in Scranton since she was 1954. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=199.28s)]
*  But when you ask mom, where is she from? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=202.28s)]
*  She says Scranton. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=205.28s)]
*  I'm Pittsburgh. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=207.28s)]
*  And because of I really mean it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=208.28s)]
*  Are you inspired by your president? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=213.28s)]
*  While Biden is rambling on incoherently on the campaign trail, the White House is now [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=215.28s)]
*  calling for tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports to be tripled. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=219.28s)]
*  Now, in 2019, that same Joe Biden actually ridiculed Donald Trump for a similar move. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=224.28s)]
*  Quote, Trump doesn't get the basics. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=229.28s)]
*  He thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=232.28s)]
*  Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying for his tariffs, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=235.28s)]
*  Joe's tariffs. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=241.28s)]
*  Anyway, Joe means like all the corporate taxes proposals that he laid out this week, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=243.28s)]
*  they're going to be paid for by you too. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=248.28s)]
*  Corporations don't pay taxes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=250.28s)]
*  They pass that on to you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=252.28s)]
*  Now, of course, in reality, Biden doesn't even know what day of the week it is, much [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=254.28s)]
*  less the basics of international trade policy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=258.28s)]
*  Unless, of course, there is a 10% cut for the big guy, he probably understands that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=261.28s)]
*  part. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=266.28s)]
*  Democrats are now trying to reelect a cognitive mess with a record of failure who can barely [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=267.28s)]
*  muster the energy to campaign and is now trying to create a phony appearance of being [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=274.28s)]
*  America first, something he outright rejected just four years ago. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=279.28s)]
*  And Trump, meanwhile, is gaining momentum. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=284.28s)]
*  He's drawing big crowds. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=286.28s)]
*  He's leading in the polls. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=288.28s)]
*  And it is no surprise that a New York judge who donated to Biden, oh, that's fair, is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=289.28s)]
*  now keeping the Trump campaign and Donald Trump, the candidate, off the campaign trail, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=295.28s)]
*  trapped in a courtroom. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=301.28s)]
*  And if Democrats had their way, he'd be in court for the next 201 days with a muzzle on [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=303.28s)]
*  the entire time, like the gag order New York has imposed on Donald J. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=310.28s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=314.28s)]
*  As it stands right now, Trump is mandated to appear in a Manhattan court every single [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=315.28s)]
*  Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from now until whenever this ludicrous trial, you [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=321.28s)]
*  know, eventually will wrap up, probably a month, maybe five, six weeks from now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=327.28s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=331.28s)]
*  New York state law does allow a judge to waive a defendant's, quote, mandatory attendance [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=332.28s)]
*  after a required motion if the prosecutor doesn't object. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=338.28s)]
*  But don't expect that from the judge in this case, Juan Mershon. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=343.28s)]
*  Mershon has already threatened Trump with jail if he fails to appear and also issued that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=347.28s)]
*  unprecedented gag order preventing Donald Trump from even defending himself in public. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=353.28s)]
*  He's not allowed. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=358.28s)]
*  Or they're going to put him in jail. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=359.28s)]
*  What happened to freedom of speech? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=361.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, other people that are involved in the case, they're free to speak out anywhere, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=363.28s)]
*  anytime about anything. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=368.28s)]
*  And they are again. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=370.28s)]
*  This is a judge he donated to Joe Biden, President Trump's chief political rival, whose [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=371.28s)]
*  daughter reportedly a Democratic political operative. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=378.28s)]
*  And this so-called trial is being based on what? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=381.28s)]
*  An eight year old misdemeanor allegation well past the statute of limitations that even [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=384.28s)]
*  the DOJ, even Alvin Bragg's predecessor, all passed on was revived by this far left [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=390.28s)]
*  DA Bragg because of political pressure, marginally turning this into a felony, trying to use [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=397.28s)]
*  federal statutes to do it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=403.28s)]
*  Sadly, Trump will be judged by a Manhattan jury pool. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=405.28s)]
*  90 percent of New York City, they voted for Joe Biden. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=409.28s)]
*  And in 201 days of Biden wins reelection, God help us, because this weaponized Department [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=413.28s)]
*  of Justice, it will never recover. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=419.28s)]
*  Say bye bye to the rule of law in America, because it will fold like a house of cards. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=422.28s)]
*  Anyway, we have a lot of ground to cover. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ClExxmPac&t=428.28s)]
