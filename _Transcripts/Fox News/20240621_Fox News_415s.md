# Trump lawyer: We will clean house in November
**Fox News:** [June 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w)
*  Donald Trump continues to fight the left's lawfare in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=0.0s)]
*  Earlier today, his attorneys filed a motion to have Judge Ingoron recuse from that sham [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  civil fraud case. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Remember, that was about a case about valuations, and he's the judge that put a valuation on [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=12.72s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago at $18 million. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  And if you want to buy a two-acre lot in Palm Beach, it's on the ocean, even though Mar-a-Lago [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=21.16s)]
*  goes on the ocean and on the intercoastal and historic property and a club and 54 bedrooms, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=26.84s)]
*  etc., etc., in pristine condition, yeah, the two-acre lot would cost you, well, between [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=32.96s)]
*  $1.5 million and higher. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=39.46s)]
*  Anyway, accusing him of engaging in actions fundamentally incompatible with the responsibilities [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  attendant to donning the black robe and sitting in judgment. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=48.2s)]
*  And while the left continues to spend time and resources waging endless lawfare against [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=52.16s)]
*  Trump in New York, the city, they are reeling from more shocking crime. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=57.08s)]
*  Remember the pro-Palestinian mob that took over that building at Columbia University? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  You know, the one that required the NYPD officers to climb through the open window to evacuate [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=66.36s)]
*  that building? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=71.8s)]
*  Well, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, the guy that ran on getting Trump, his office announced [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=72.8s)]
*  today charges would be dropped against the vast majority of those rioters. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=78.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=83.0s)]
*  Ask yourself. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=84.0s)]
*  The answer is simple. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  Their last name is not Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=86.68s)]
*  And meanwhile, the left is in full panic mode as we wait for the Supreme Court of our great [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=88.76s)]
*  country and their decision on Trump's immunity in the January 6th case, which could come [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=93.82000000000001s)]
*  any day now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  Now, Trump legal spokesperson Alina Haber and Fox News contributor Jason Chafetz join [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  us. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  Alina, let's look at this case. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  This action refers to a conversation that Engoran allegedly had with the New York City [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=107.12s)]
*  real estate attorney regarding the merits of this case, in which he's the judge of, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  and the permissible scope of the New York state attorney generals and the court's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=119.12s)]
*  own authority under executive law. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  And here's something that really shocked me, and the consequences of this court's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=125.8s)]
*  decision on business in the state. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=131.28s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=133.4s)]
*  Is any of this, including the $18 million valuation of Mar-a-Lago ethical? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=134.52s)]
*  No. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=140.12s)]
*  No. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=141.12s)]
*  But misapplying law to fact is very different than what this motion is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=142.12s)]
*  And I just want to be really clear for the listeners on what happened here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=147.76s)]
*  This attorney, Mr. Bailey, went on TV bragging about the fact that he had spoken with the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=151.78s)]
*  judge that was sitting on our case, Judge Engoran. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=156.68s)]
*  The judge had not issued his final decision on this case. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=160.12s)]
*  And this attorney, who has sued Trump, Sean, more than six times, has now gone up to a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=163.48s)]
*  judge sitting on an active case and spoken to him about the case. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  That is not allowed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=175.8s)]
*  He never notified the parties. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=176.8s)]
*  Not allowed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=178.66s)]
*  This goes way beyond anything else that we already know. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=179.66s)]
*  And it gave us another reason to say, yet again, you need to step down. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=182.72s)]
*  You need to take your robe, your code of judicial conduct seriously. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=187.16s)]
*  As we know and have heard, there's obviously the Office of Attorney, Ethics and Judicial [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=192.24s)]
*  Commission looking at this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=197.42000000000002s)]
*  But we cannot wait any longer for these judges to sit there and make the right decision. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=199.0s)]
*  So we have to act. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  And the Trump team is going to continue to push and push and put the true facts out. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  We've also subpoenaed the individual. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=208.56s)]
*  We're going to look at what their communications were and see how corrupt—how much more corrupt, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=210.24s)]
*  let me correct myself—this case is from what we already knew. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=216.08s)]
*  Would this vacate the decision? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  If this was influenced, if we do find out about it, absolutely there are grounds to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=224.92s)]
*  vacate the decision for a reversal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=228.62s)]
*  Frankly, as we know, this case was a sham to start with. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=230.92s)]
*  As you said, Bragg has completely dismissed people that were violent on campuses. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=234.16s)]
*  But when it comes to Trump, you know, we have a different standard. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=240.48s)]
*  This has to stop. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=244.12s)]
*  I can tell you, in November, I would push President Trump 100 percent to correct the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=245.12s)]
*  judicial process and to stop this dual system of justice. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=249.88s)]
*  It has to. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=252.78s)]
*  We have to reverse it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=253.78s)]
*  The case was a joke to start with, just like every other case against President Trump. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=254.78s)]
*  Let's get your take, Jason Schaffetz. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=258.64s)]
*  We're talking about the valuation of Trump properties. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=261.8s)]
*  And you had this testimony that was so sharp. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=267.36s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=270.32s)]
*  And they're going after Donald Trump on these paperwork issues. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=271.58s)]
*  There are people getting murdered and slaughtered. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=275.78s)]
*  There are people that have a certain faith, the Jewish faith, that are being intimidated [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=278.5s)]
*  on the streets of New York. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=283.64s)]
*  You have protesters that are violently going after these buildings, defacing buildings, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=285.3s)]
*  taking over buildings. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  You have these New York City cops that have to put their lives on the line. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=291.5s)]
*  And then they go and they drop all the cases against those people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  Instead, they want to go after Donald Trump because of paperwork issues? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=300.66s)]
*  What the crap is wrong with New York? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=304.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a great point. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=307.38s)]
*  I don't care if it's a civil case or the sham trial that took place, you know, with [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=309.94s)]
*  Alvin Bragg, and yet it continues. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=315.18s)]
*  But meanwhile, the people that take over buildings in New York are the people on videotape, Jason [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=317.86s)]
*  beating the living crap out of police officers. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=322.62s)]
*  They don't even get charged. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=325.7s)]
*  They get a slap on the wrist and they get walked right out the door and they don't even [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=326.7s)]
*  They get no bail. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=329.97999999999996s)]
*  Explain how that's justice in America. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=332.38s)]
*  Well, it's not. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=334.97999999999996s)]
*  And everybody sees it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=337.73999999999995s)]
*  America understands this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=339.7s)]
*  America understands that it is fundamentally not justice. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=341.17999999999995s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=345.34s)]
*  Americans are very fair people. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=346.58s)]
*  They're very forgiving people. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=347.76s)]
*  If it's a kid on a ball field and he gets wronged, you know what? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=349.17999999999995s)]
*  Everybody says, hey, that was wrong. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=352.02s)]
*  And that's why they're looking at Donald Trump and they're just saying they're picking [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  on the Trumps. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=356.7s)]
*  They're picking on the Trump kids. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=357.7s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=359.34000000000003s)]
*  That's not who we are in the United States of America. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  And at every opportunity, Joe Biden could have done something to to show that he was [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=362.86s)]
*  magnanimous, to show that he was fair. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=368.1s)]
*  He never, ever did that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  This guy is he is evil in the way he attacks the Trump family. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=372.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=378.3s)]
*  Last word, Alina, how about. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=379.3s)]
*  I'm just really proud of the team. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=382.66s)]
*  And I want to say one thing very clearly. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=384.12s)]
*  I know that everybody hears a lot of noise of this legal lawfare against President Trump. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=385.86s)]
*  But as we've seen, every single one from Jack Smith to Fannie to now in Gore and we'll [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=390.1s)]
*  come down crashing like the domino effect that they are. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=394.3s)]
*  They are fake and we will clean house in November. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=396.82s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=399.26s)]
*  All right, Alina. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=400.26s)]
*  Thank you, Jason. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuerkwC57w&t=401.26s)]
