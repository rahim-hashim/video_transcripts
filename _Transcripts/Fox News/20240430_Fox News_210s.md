# Police arrest anti-Israel protesters at Columbia University
**Fox News:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU)
*  Let us go back to Alexis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=0.0s)]
*  She's standing by tonight with the very latest on the ground. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  What's happening, Alexis? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=6.68s)]
*  Well, I just want to show you here before we get kicked off. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=7.68s)]
*  We're going to flip around. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  These are the protesters who just got on those buses here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  They just took them out of Hamilton Hall, and this is kind of the latest here on the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=15.4s)]
*  ground right outside of Columbia. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=19.84s)]
*  So I don't know exactly how many students were in those buses that have pulled in so [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  far. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=25.94s)]
*  They're kind of moving us back here, so just hang with us, Sean. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=26.94s)]
*  There were a lot of them that came out in zip ties, and they put them on those buses. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  They're going to bring them downtown. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=33.54s)]
*  They're going to get hit, according to sources, with probably disorderly conduct charges [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=34.699999999999996s)]
*  and trespassing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=38.5s)]
*  But they didn't get out of that Hamilton Hall for hours, okay? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=39.5s)]
*  So we're going to move you down here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=42.9s)]
*  But that's what happened. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=48.7s)]
*  The NYPD went into Hamilton Hall. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=49.7s)]
*  They gave them several chances to get out. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=51.459999999999994s)]
*  In terms of barricades or what it looked like inside of Hamilton Hall, we don't know just [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=54.34s)]
*  yet. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=57.82s)]
*  They brought them out, and then when we looked into the bus, they were screaming and yelling, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=58.82s)]
*  you know, Free Palestine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  So they continue it, even though they're already in handcuffs on those buses. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=64.3s)]
*  So we're going to get pushed over here a little bit to give you a look at kind of the media [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=67.66s)]
*  set up here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=71.66s)]
*  But this is what the NYPD has going on right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=72.66s)]
*  So in terms of what charges they'll face, we'll have to continue to wait to see, because [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=79.06s)]
*  that they had damaged a lot of that property inside of Hamilton Hall. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=84.34s)]
*  Yeah, Alexis, I'm not sure you can hear me. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=89.06s)]
*  If you can hear me, I hope you can. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=92.22s)]
*  If anything, we just watched the police go in one by one in the window on the side of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=95.42s)]
*  Hamilton Hall, and you're saying already that the students are being taken out and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=99.98s)]
*  being put into those buses, which would tell me that at least there's not any kind of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  violent confrontation, at least initially, that we're learning inside of that building, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=112.22000000000001s)]
*  or else I doubt they would have gotten out of there so quickly. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  Is that a fair assumption? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=119.38000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they did their best to move in pretty quickly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=122.78s)]
*  They got that call only a short time ago from the president, Manu Shafik here, who's also [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=124.98s)]
*  getting calls to resign and step down because people think she didn't handle this chaos [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=128.82s)]
*  well. So they moved in with those zip ties. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=133.70000000000002s)]
*  They brought in a special team of people with the NYPD to kind of handle this situation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=135.54000000000002s)]
*  And then in terms of going in, right, like you said, to go into those windows, it's because [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=141.26000000000002s)]
*  they wouldn't come out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=145.18s)]
*  And they, you know, had they were up on the roof, as we saw today, where they were ordering [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=146.38s)]
*  their dinner orders that were getting delivered and pulled up with ropes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=149.78s)]
*  So they didn't know exactly how many protesters were inside. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  We don't even know at this time, right, if they have all those protesters cuffed and on [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=155.58s)]
*  those buses. There were several buses and they weren't full just yet. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=159.46s)]
*  They had police on some of those that were still going to move into campus. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  And it's not just for Hamilton Hall, right, Sean, it's also for that Gaza solidarity [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=165.54000000000002s)]
*  encampment. They want that out of here at Columbia for several reasons, including they're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=169.9s)]
*  supposed to get ready for commencement graduation right any day. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=173.5s)]
*  So they've had enough of it here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  But the police had to come in. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=178.18s)]
*  They had to wait for that call and wait for that call from the university. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=179.86s)]
*  Jewish students and their families pay all this money to send them here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=182.34s)]
*  Didn't feel safe. They kept asking when are they going to call in the NYPD? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, tonight was the night. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=188.3s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Alexis, again, as you have been asking these students, they really can't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=190.74s)]
*  give you a good reason why it is that in fact they're there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=195.58s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO9l01DBKkU&t=197.98000000000002s)]
