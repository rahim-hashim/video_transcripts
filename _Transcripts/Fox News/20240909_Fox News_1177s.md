# Sean Hannity: The deck will be stacked against Trump during the debate
**Fox News:** [September 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=0.0s)]
*  In just 24 hours from right now, the one and only scheduled presidential debate between [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=2.16s)]
*  Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will take place. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=7.36s)]
*  You watch it right here on the Fox News Channel. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=9.68s)]
*  But unfortunately, it is being moderated by ABC Disney. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=11.56s)]
*  Barring some kind of political miracle, this debate will not be fair. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=16.12s)]
*  ABC Disney is officially a woke left-wing organization. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=20.36s)]
*  ABC News, they have been openly rooting for Kamala Harris. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=24.599999999999998s)]
*  For example, David Muir is one of the moderators. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=28.6s)]
*  Look at this new study, just happened to come out. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  Media Research Center. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=34.56s)]
*  His coverage of Kamala Harris on ABC World News tonight, 100 percent positive since the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=36.44s)]
*  day she became the candidate. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  100 percent coverage of Donald Trump, 93 percent negative. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=44.92s)]
*  And another anchor for ABC Disney is George Stephanopoulos. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=50.44s)]
*  Now, he's been Clinton's former attack dog, who ABC has now rebranded a hard news [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=54.0s)]
*  journalist. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=62.48s)]
*  He is anything but. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=63.48s)]
*  He is a left-wing radical talk show host masquerading like most in the media mob as a journalist. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=64.48s)]
*  And yet another anchor for ABC is someone named—remember Martha Raddatz? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=70.8s)]
*  She cried. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=75.36s)]
*  Very upset on air when Donald Trump won in 2016. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=76.4s)]
*  Let us be clear. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=81.96s)]
*  The deck tomorrow will be stacked against former President Trump, kind of as per usual. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=82.96s)]
*  You can see when left-wing politics takes over programming, well, the results are a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=87.76s)]
*  disaster. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  We just learned this week, Fallon lost one day of his show, late night comedy, if you [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  want to call it comedy, and his show is tanking in the ratings. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=98.08s)]
*  So is Colbert's show, and so is ABC Disney's Kimmel's show. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  They're all failing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=106.84s)]
*  Kimmel has even said late night comedy is coming to an end. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=107.84s)]
*  Why is it coming to an end? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=111.16s)]
*  They are not funny, and they're hardcore politically left. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=112.92s)]
*  They say, we don't care about the rest of the country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=116.36s)]
*  Maybe Bob Iker and his left-wing heir apparent, maybe they don't want half the country to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=119.64s)]
*  attend their theme parks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=124.7s)]
*  Maybe they don't care about their tanking stock price, which is their prerogative. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=126.12s)]
*  They're free to make that choice. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=131.44s)]
*  But if they are biased against Donald Trump, as they have been leading into tomorrow night, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=132.84s)]
*  as their nightly newscast is, half the country is not going to like it one bit. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=139.32s)]
*  They're not going to like ABC Disney one bit either. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  But it's not just the left-wing moderators at far left ABC News. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  Now, if Kamala Harris shows up tomorrow night with a pulse, everyone in the state-run media [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=151.08s)]
*  Bob, oh my gosh, she's not Joe. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=157.8s)]
*  She actually put two sentences together that she rehearsed for days and days and days and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=160.4s)]
*  days. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  They will declare her the clear winner. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, there are even people saying that Joe Biden won the last debate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  And with, of course, the far left bias at ABC, it is highly unlikely Kamala is going [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=174.4s)]
*  to be pressed about her radical positions. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  You know her long-held beliefs that anonymous aides are now telling us that she no longer [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  supports. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=187.4s)]
*  She's been for open borders, immigration, sanctuary cities forever. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=188.4s)]
*  But now all of a sudden she's changing her mind, hated borders forever. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=192.64s)]
*  In other words, the beliefs that she has held for years and years and still really does [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=195.88s)]
*  hold, but is just lying through her, through her campaign staff, in order to win an election. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  But don't take my word for it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=206.92s)]
*  Here's Kamala's longtime Senate ally. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=209.88s)]
*  She supported the government health care for all bill, no private health insurance bill [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  with Bernie Sanders and the radical $93 trillion Green New Deal, again, co-sponsored with [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=217.17999999999998s)]
*  Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=222.61999999999998s)]
*  Let's listen to Bernie on this topic. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=223.94s)]
*  You have described Vice President Kamala Harris as a progressive. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=226.61999999999998s)]
*  She has previously supported Medicare for All now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=230.45999999999998s)]
*  She does not. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=234.14s)]
*  She's previously supported a ban on fracking now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=235.14s)]
*  She does not. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=237.7s)]
*  These, Senator, are ideas that you have campaigned on. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=239.1s)]
*  Do you think that she is abandoning her progressive ideals? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=242.54s)]
*  No, I don't think she's abandoning her ideals. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=246.38s)]
*  I think she's trying to be pragmatic and doing what she thinks is right in order to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  win the election. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=255.94s)]
*  Pragmatic to win. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=259.26s)]
*  Lie to win. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=260.34s)]
*  Bernie Sanders stumbled on the truth there and he said the secret part openly there. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  There is zero chance that you will hear the truth from Kamala on that debate stage tomorrow [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=267.26s)]
*  That I can promise you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=271.62s)]
*  Her rehearsed lines will be all gibberish and nonsense and running away from all of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=272.78s)]
*  her passwords. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=278.38s)]
*  The brand new policy section of her own website is more of a wish list full of vague hopes [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=279.38s)]
*  and dreams without any details or actual plans. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=284.62s)]
*  Luckily, nearly all of Kamala's long-held beliefs, we have them all on tape. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=288.14s)]
*  We call them the Kamala files. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=292.9s)]
*  We have the Walls files for our running mate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=294.36s)]
*  It's on Hannity.com. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  You can send it to your friends, your neighbors, your coworkers. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=297.86s)]
*  Put it on social media. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=300.62s)]
*  So tonight, I'm going to dedicate the rest of my monologue to helping Bob Iger's ABC [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=302.26s)]
*  Disney and ABC News. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to do the research for them so they know the questions to ask for the debate, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=311.38s)]
*  the ones that Americans need answers to in this very critical time, this inflection point [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=317.02000000000004s)]
*  in our country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  And it's just simply Kamala in her own words. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=324.38s)]
*  Now, let's—since Kamala first served as border czar under Biden, let's start with [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  the vice president's views on immigration. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  She told us for three-plus years the border was secure, and she never went there, but [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=335.5s)]
*  she never went to Europe, as nearly 11 million unvetted Biden illegal immigrants, including [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=340.14s)]
*  murderers and rapists, people committing violent crimes, and hundreds with terror ties have [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=345.46s)]
*  come into our country. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  We don't know where those people are, by the way. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=354.38s)]
*  Would you call the border secure? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=355.86s)]
*  I think that there is no question that we have to do what the president and I asked [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=358.38s)]
*  Congress to do. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=364.46s)]
*  The first request we made, pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=365.62s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=373.94s)]
*  You're confident this border is secure? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=374.94s)]
*  We have a secure border, in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=378.74s)]
*  our administration. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=386.74s)]
*  Well, ABC doesn't even ask that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=387.74s)]
*  As it turns out, Kamala doesn't really care about border security. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=390.5s)]
*  She never has and never will. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=393.7s)]
*  You decide. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=395.42s)]
*  It's a height of irresponsibility for the commander-in-chief to suggest that we have [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=396.42s)]
*  to build a wall across our southern border because there are terrorists who are trying [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=403.3s)]
*  to invade the country. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  It couldn't be farther from the truth. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=412.06s)]
*  On the subject of transnational gangs, let's be perfectly clear. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=413.94s)]
*  The president's medieval vanity project is not going to stop them. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=419.3s)]
*  You support giving universal health care and Medicare for all to people who are in this [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  country illegally? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=427.74s)]
*  Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=428.74s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=431.62s)]
*  to public safety, public education or public health, period. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=438.82s)]
*  We've got to critically re-examine ICE and its role and the way that it is being administered [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=444.1s)]
*  and the work it is doing, and we need to probably think about starting from scratch. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=449.26s)]
*  Hundreds of Harris-Biden illegals with terror ties are in the country. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=454.3s)]
*  We don't know where they are. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=458.14s)]
*  She's offering free housing, health care, education and a path to citizenship. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=459.5s)]
*  That would be called, let's see, amnesty, if you're guessing at home. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=463.46000000000004s)]
*  Now, but whatever you do, under Harris administration, don't dare say the word illegal alien or [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=467.02000000000004s)]
*  radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=473.02000000000004s)]
*  You need to be courageous. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=474.78000000000003s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=476.22s)]
*  You must have the courage to object when they use that term, radical Islamic terrorism, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=477.22s)]
*  which is more than the greatest victims of terror. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=487.02000000000004s)]
*  And we must also have the courage to reject that term, illegal alien. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=493.02000000000004s)]
*  I have seen some of the worst of criminal behavior. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=502.02000000000004s)]
*  I have seen the worst of crime. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=509.02000000000004s)]
*  An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=512.02s)]
*  Don't dare utter those words. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=517.02s)]
*  By the way, Bob Iger, ABC Disney, what would Tim Russer do? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=519.02s)]
*  What would David Brinkley do? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=522.02s)]
*  What would Peter Jennings do? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=524.02s)]
*  They'd ask these questions. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=525.02s)]
*  What will David Muir do? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=527.02s)]
*  It's your network. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=528.02s)]
*  It's your company. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=529.02s)]
*  It's your stock price. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=530.02s)]
*  And maybe you don't want to have the country go into your theme parks. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=532.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=535.02s)]
*  We'll find out tomorrow. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=536.02s)]
*  And while Vice President Harris wants to decriminalize illegal immigration in every way, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=537.02s)]
*  she also wants to criminalize legal gun ownership. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=542.02s)]
*  Here's her plan to confiscate your guns. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=545.8199999999999s)]
*  What would you do about the millions of specifically assault weapons that are already in circulation? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=548.8199999999999s)]
*  What do you do about those? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=557.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, there are approximately five million to your point, Craig. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=558.8199999999999s)]
*  We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory buyback program. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=561.8199999999999s)]
*  It's got to be smart. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=564.8199999999999s)]
*  We've got to do it the right way. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=565.8199999999999s)]
*  Mandatory. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=567.8199999999999s)]
*  Key word. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=568.8199999999999s)]
*  Sondra Kamala, if her values really haven't changed, she's, well, going to penalize you, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=569.8199999999999s)]
*  law-abiding citizens, for exercising your Second Amendment rights. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=574.82s)]
*  But if you are a criminal, you break the law. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=579.32s)]
*  You are in luck. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  Because in 2020, Kamala supported defunding ICE, defunding the police, and she even praised [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=582.74s)]
*  the violent rioters and looters. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=588.24s)]
*  And she promoted a bail fund after a police precinct was burned to the ground four days [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=590.6600000000001s)]
*  later. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=596.22s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=597.22s)]
*  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're not going to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=598.22s)]
*  stop after Election Day. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels, that this isn't, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=603.3s)]
*  they're not going to let up, and they should not. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=607.66s)]
*  Talk to me about the defund the police movement, and what do you think is the most, the first [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=609.92s)]
*  piece of legislation that should happen towards reforming the police? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=615.2199999999999s)]
*  So at its essence, Andy, it really, I believe, is about reimagining public safety and how [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=621.54s)]
*  we achieve it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=628.9s)]
*  So ABC Disney, Bob Iger, do you think that ABC News should be asking these questions [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=631.78s)]
*  tomorrow night? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=638.64s)]
*  And it gets worse. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=639.64s)]
*  Kamala also made it a priority to get taxpayer-funded sex change operations for criminals in prison. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=640.64s)]
*  I didn't make it up. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=647.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=648.5799999999999s)]
*  They were standing in the way of surgery. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=649.5799999999999s)]
*  For prisoners. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=652.5s)]
*  For prisoners. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=655.5s)]
*  And there was a specific case. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=656.5s)]
*  And when I learned about the case, I worked behind the scenes to not only make sure that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=659.18s)]
*  that transgender woman got the services she was deserving. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=662.62s)]
*  So it wasn't only about that case. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=667.6999999999999s)]
*  I made sure that they changed the policy in the state of California so that every transgender [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=669.06s)]
*  inmate in the prison system would have access to the medical care that they desired and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=676.9399999999999s)]
*  need. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=682.42s)]
*  So Kamala wants taxpayer-funded sex changes for criminals, fewer police, more riots. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=684.3s)]
*  They're not going to stop. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=689.18s)]
*  Won't stop. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=690.18s)]
*  Somebody tell Liz Cheney. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=691.18s)]
*  And at the same time, she wants to grow the size of government to a scale we've never [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=692.18s)]
*  seen before, with new regulations, restrictions, frankly, Marxism, $93 trillion new Green Deal, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=696.0999999999999s)]
*  that bill that she co-sponsored with Bernie Sanders in the Senate. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=703.6999999999999s)]
*  As president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=708.66s)]
*  New Deal. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=714.9399999999999s)]
*  Leaders have to lead. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=715.9399999999999s)]
*  Plastic straws are a big thing right now. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=716.9399999999999s)]
*  Do you ban plastic straws? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=719.5s)]
*  I think we should. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=720.86s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=722.54s)]
*  adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=727.5799999999999s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=732.06s)]
*  So would you ban offshore drilling? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=735.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=737.38s)]
*  I've, again, worked on that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=738.42s)]
*  No fracking, no drilling, no plastic straws. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=741.5s)]
*  And here's one other big one. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=744.46s)]
*  No more private health insurance. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=746.34s)]
*  Government-run care for all. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=749.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=750.78s)]
*  You support the Medicare for All bill, I think, initially co-sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=751.78s)]
*  You're also a co-sponsor on it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=756.46s)]
*  I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=757.98s)]
*  So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=762.08s)]
*  Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=766.18s)]
*  And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=770.5799999999999s)]
*  them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=774.62s)]
*  Who of us has not had that situation where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=778.74s)]
*  says, well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=782.5799999999999s)]
*  Let's eliminate all of that. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=786.5s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=787.66s)]
*  So much for the Freedom and Joy Party. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=790.06s)]
*  No private health insurance. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=791.9399999999999s)]
*  She also has big plans for reparations. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=793.22s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=795.5s)]
*  Should black people get reparations? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=796.5s)]
*  I think there has to be some form of reparations. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=797.5s)]
*  And we can discuss what that is. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=800.5s)]
*  So you might be asking, how does Kamala plan to pay for all these new radical endeavors? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=803.7s)]
*  Taxes, you pay for it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=808.66s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=810.74s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, new darling of the party, she officially has more Twitter followers [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=811.94s)]
*  than Nancy Pelosi. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=815.82s)]
*  She was on 60 Minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=816.82s)]
*  And she's promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=820.7s)]
*  every car should be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80% [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=824.26s)]
*  tax rate. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=829.06s)]
*  Do you agree that she could possibly, and this ideology of the socialist left could [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=830.06s)]
*  splinter your party? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=833.62s)]
*  No. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=834.98s)]
*  You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=835.98s)]
*  I think that's fantastic. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=841.22s)]
*  I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=842.9s)]
*  But we've got to increase the corporate tax rate. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=848.34s)]
*  We also have to increase taxes for the top 1%. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=851.8s)]
*  And that part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=855.66s)]
*  And also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=859.8s)]
*  And unrealized capital gains. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=864.12s)]
*  Make no mistake, taxes will go up on every American if she is elected. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=865.8399999999999s)]
*  This includes young Americans just starting out. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=869.8599999999999s)]
*  But according to Kamala, they're too stupid to have any clue what's going on anyway. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=872.3599999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=878.24s)]
*  What's the other thing we know about this population? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=879.6s)]
*  And it's a specific phase of life. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=881.82s)]
*  Remember, age is more than a chronological fact. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=883.44s)]
*  What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=886.36s)]
*  They are stupid. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=889.74s)]
*  That is why we put them in dormitories. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=893.9200000000001s)]
*  And they have a resident assistant. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=897.6s)]
*  They make really bad decisions. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=900.88s)]
*  That was a really dumb thing to say, in my view. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=905.02s)]
*  Apparently, she thinks 18 and 24-year-olds are stupid. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=907.6s)]
*  And here she is praising Bidenomics and lying about inflation. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=911.5600000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=915.76s)]
*  Was it wrong to consider inflation transitory? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=916.76s)]
*  These price spikes seem like they're going to be with us for a while. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=920.6s)]
*  We have to address the fact that we got to deal with the fact that folks are paying for [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=923.34s)]
*  gas, paying for groceries, and need solutions to it. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=929.0s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=934.68s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=937.68s)]
*  And we are very proud of Bidenomics. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=942.76s)]
*  And as today's jobs numbers make clear, Bidenomics is working. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=945.5999999999999s)]
*  A little over a year ago, she's saying the opposite now. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=950.7199999999999s)]
*  And of course, she owns Bidenomics and Biden inflation. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=954.3599999999999s)]
*  She played a critical role in the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=957.8399999999999s)]
*  In fact, according to her, she was usually the last person in the room with President [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=961.28s)]
*  Biden during any important policy decision, like the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=966.3199999999999s)]
*  which we learned today that our allies and many in our military did not want them to [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=971.92s)]
*  do because it was dumb. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=977.04s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=979.12s)]
*  President Biden always said that he wants you to be the last person in the room, particularly [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=980.68s)]
*  for big decisions, just as he was for President Obama. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=985.24s)]
*  He just made a really big decision, Afghanistan. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=988.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=990.72s)]
*  Were you the last person in the room? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=991.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=993.76s)]
*  And you feel comfortable? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=994.76s)]
*  I do. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=996.12s)]
*  And I'm going to add to that. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=998.2s)]
*  This is a president who has an extraordinary amount of courage. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1003.22s)]
*  Thirteen Americans died. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1010.16s)]
*  Thirteen. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1014.44s)]
*  And many Americans were abandoned behind enemy lines. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1016.7199999999999s)]
*  Ironically, Kamala's favorite phrase doesn't apply to her. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1018.9599999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1022.52s)]
*  If Bob Iger is Disney, ABC News Disney does its job, she will most definitely be burdened [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1046.52s)]
*  by what has been. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1062.44s)]
*  She's burdened by her role in the Biden-Harris administration, burdened by her long-held [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1064.04s)]
*  radical beliefs in her own words. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1069.0s)]
*  She's burdened by her lackluster track record as a political opportunist. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1071.44s)]
*  And tomorrow night, she faces another burden, no teleprompter. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1076.68s)]
*  But Kamala, she's on home turf at ABC News with moderators who want her to win, you know, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1081.44s)]
*  bearing—you know, barring any kind of political miracle here. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1087.48s)]
*  It will be three-on-one against Donald Trump all night. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1090.94s)]
*  And all that we showed you, ABC has an obligation to get answers to, because the election is [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1095.04s)]
*  in 57 days. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1101.3s)]
*  Early voting ballots have gone out in states already. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1103.18s)]
*  Early voting starts one week from tomorrow in Pennsylvania, rolls out quickly around [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1106.74s)]
*  the country. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1111.3s)]
*  But after the debate, we will hold Kamala accountable. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1112.5s)]
*  The media will say, she's strung three sentences together. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1116.14s)]
*  She wins, she wins. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1118.78s)]
*  We'll be in the spin room. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1119.78s)]
*  We'll be in Philly. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1121.38s)]
*  We'll have our cheesesteak in the afternoon. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1122.38s)]
*  And we will expose her radical agenda every night until election night. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1124.92s)]
*  The question tomorrow, will ABC News be a news organization, or will they be, as they [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1129.74s)]
*  have been on ABC—you know, World News Tonight, are they going to be 100 percent pro-Kamala, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1136.3s)]
*  93 percent negative Trump? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1143.42s)]
*  And if Disney's comfortable with that, what is Disney saying to people that hold different [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1146.7s)]
*  views? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1153.1000000000001s)]
*  What are they saying to the country? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1154.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, is that the type of organization that half the country's going to want to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1155.5s)]
*  support? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1160.6599999999999s)]
*  Is there a reason why late night television hosts are all failing? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nGE7Bm6Bo&t=1161.9399999999998s)]
