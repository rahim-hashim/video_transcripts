# Karoline Leavitt: Trump will not tolerate siding with 'radical Islamic terrorists'
**Fox News:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8)
*  All right, the state-run legacy media mob has clearly not learned their lesson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=0.0s)]
*  Despite their rapidly declining relevance, they are still trying to make a name for themselves. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  But no surprise, picking fights, they do it by picking fights with the Trump administration [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=11.3s)]
*  every chance they get. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Watch this exchange between an AP reporter and White House press secretary, Caroline [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=16.92s)]
*  Leavitt. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=21.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=22.76s)]
*  When President Trump last addressed the BRT, when he was on the campaign trail, his big [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=23.76s)]
*  push was on tax cuts. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=27.6s)]
*  He's going there today as he's proposing tax hikes in the form of tariffs. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=29.72s)]
*  And I'm curious for why — [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=33.92s)]
*  He's not doing — [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=35.32s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=36.32s)]
*  Have you ever paid a tariff? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=37.32s)]
*  Because I have. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=38.32s)]
*  They don't get charged on foreign companies. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=39.32s)]
*  They get charged on the importers. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  And ultimately, when we have fair and balanced trade, which the American people have not [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=43.2s)]
*  seen in decades, as I said at the beginning, revenues will stay here, wages will go up, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=47.84s)]
*  and our country will be made wealthy again. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=53.76s)]
*  And I think it's insulting that you're trying to test my knowledge of economics and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=55.72s)]
*  the decisions that this president has made. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=60.36s)]
*  I now regret giving a question to the Associated Press. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=62.8s)]
*  Checkmate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=66.36s)]
*  Anyway, and tariffs were not the only issue driving the media mob crazy today in the briefing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=67.36s)]
*  room. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=73.32s)]
*  They also wanted to know why the Trump administration wants to deport the leader of anti-Israel [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=74.32s)]
*  protests at Columbia University at the campus there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=78.88s)]
*  Turns out there is a really good reason. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=81.88s)]
*  They'd only do a little work. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=85.58000000000001s)]
*  This is an individual who organized group protests that not only disrupted college campus [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=87.7s)]
*  classes and harassed Jewish American students and made them feel unsafe on their own college [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=93.9s)]
*  campus, but also distributed pro-Hamas propaganda, flyers with the logo of Hamas. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=99.34s)]
*  That is what the behavior and activity that this individual engaged in. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=106.26s)]
*  All right, here now with our Hannity Washington briefing is the one and only White House press [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=111.3s)]
*  secretary, Caroline Levitt. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=116.86s)]
*  I don't know what part I like better. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  Okay, correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=121.3s)]
*  I've read Hamas' charter. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  Does it not call for the destruction of Israel? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=125.58s)]
*  Is this not recognized as a known terrorist organization? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=128.9s)]
*  And if you're in this country and you support a terrorist organization and you're not a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  citizen in this country, why would one think that you have a right to stay in this country? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=137.08s)]
*  Everything you just said is true, Sean. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately, it appears the liberals and the legacy media think that if you are [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=145.84s)]
*  a foreign national, you can behave in any manner that you want. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  You can protest and push Hamas propaganda. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  You can side with a foreign terrorist organization that has killed American citizens, that has [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  murdered innocent babies, men, women and children across the globe. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=166.12s)]
*  Under this administration, that type of activity, siding with radical Islamic terrorists will [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=171.16s)]
*  not stand. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=177.68s)]
*  And the Trump administration, at the direction of President Trump's executive order, has [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=178.84s)]
*  a zero tolerance policy for foreign nationals who are given the privilege of getting a visa [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=183.66s)]
*  and going to some of our finest, our nation's finest universities and colleges, studying [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=190.38s)]
*  at those institutions and then siding with these radical terrorist organizations. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=196.94s)]
*  And so this arrest that took place on the campus of Columbia is the first of many to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=202.0s)]
*  come. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=206.62s)]
*  Secretary Noem and Secretary of State Rubio are working together. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  And I would like to add an emphasize to the mainstream media who still doesn't get it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=211.16s)]
*  This is well within the president and the secretary of state's authority. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=216.02s)]
*  Secretary Rubio revoked this individual's visa based on the Immigration and Nationality [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=221.02s)]
*  Act because this individual clearly poses an adversarial effect, consequence to the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  foreign policy and national interests of our great country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  This was the right decision. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=236.78s)]
*  President Trump promised he would stand up for Jewish American students and he is delivering [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  on that promise. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=242.46s)]
*  Now, do the countries of Canada, does Mexico, does India, do countries in the European [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=244.74s)]
*  Union, do they practice free and fair trade with us or do they put tariffs on American [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=252.74s)]
*  goods that most Americans don't know about? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  America has been ripped off by our adversaries, but even more so by our allies for far too [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=263.1s)]
*  long, especially our neighbors to the north and to the south. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=269.78s)]
*  If you look at our trade deficits, if you look at the tariffs that Canada in particular [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=273.62s)]
*  has placed on American agricultural goods to the tune of nearly 300 percent, look at [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=278.34s)]
*  the tariffs they've implemented on our automobiles. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=284.38s)]
*  And finally, the American people have a president, Sean, who is standing up for them, for hardworking [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=287.58s)]
*  American workers and their families, for our industries. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=293.34s)]
*  And the beauty of President Trump's tariff policy is that it's very simple. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=296.82s)]
*  All he's asking for is reciprocity. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=302.02s)]
*  We are finally going to treat nations the way that they have treated the United States [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=303.65999999999997s)]
*  for far too long. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=308.02s)]
*  And Canada saw, if you want to step up into the big leagues with President Trump, you [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=309.58s)]
*  better be prepared to play. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=313.42s)]
*  It looks like they are not because the Ontario premier already dropped his 25 percent tariff [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=316.74s)]
*  on electricity after having a bold threat to shut off electricity. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=322.09999999999997s)]
*  For the American people, President Trump said absolutely not. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=325.98s)]
*  He did what is right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=329.52s)]
*  He stood by the American people and his tariff policy is working. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  It's going to make America wealthy again. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  It's going to bring jobs back home. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=336.74s)]
*  And to every investor around the world, if you come to the United States and do business, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  you will face no tariffs. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  You will have the lowest taxes on the planet. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=344.14s)]
*  And that's how we're going to make America strong and wealthy again. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=346.74s)]
*  30-day ceasefire. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=349.90000000000003s)]
*  We've come a long way in 11 days. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=352.1s)]
*  When the media and Democrats were saying this is the end of the universe, I predicted that [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=353.94s)]
*  Zelensky would be back. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=360.66s)]
*  Thankfully, he is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=362.06s)]
*  Any word on the other side? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=363.3s)]
*  That being Vladimir Putin and Russia, are they any indication they are open? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=365.0s)]
*  Putin has said publicly he's open to negotiated settlement. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=369.86s)]
*  Any progress? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=373.82000000000005s)]
*  I have not been updated on the progress. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=377.66s)]
*  I know that Secretary of State Rubio and the National Security Adviser Mike Waltz are working [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  very hard on this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  The president is obviously very engaged and involved. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=386.1s)]
*  He was briefed throughout the day today on the situation unfolding in Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=390.16s)]
*  But to your point, Sean, there were a lot of doubters in the media. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=393.32000000000005s)]
*  And here in Washington, D.C., the same foreign policy class that has always doubted President [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=396.76000000000005s)]
*  Trump continues to. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=401.56s)]
*  I'm not sure when they will learn. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=402.8s)]
*  But the president masters the art of the deal. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=404.56s)]
*  He is a negotiator in chief. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=407.12s)]
*  And he put President Zelensky in his place and told him that the Americans are serious [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=409.32000000000005s)]
*  about a long term peace deal. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=415.0s)]
*  And we are very, very pleased with the way that the Ukrainians and this deal today turned [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=416.5s)]
*  out. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=421.72s)]
*  And we hope that this will continue in a long and everlasting peace. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=422.72s)]
*  That's President Trump's goal. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=427.52s)]
*  And we hope we can deliver on that goal. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=428.9s)]
*  I made a promise yesterday I was buying a Tesla and people can look at it on Hannity.com [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5iwDbX1Y8&t=431.24s)]
