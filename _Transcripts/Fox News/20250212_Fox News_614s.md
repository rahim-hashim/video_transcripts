# Sean Hannity: Democrats are losing it
**Fox News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc)
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, big things are once again happening in the D.C. swamp at the Department of Justice. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=2.16s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi just announced a major new lawsuit against New York State. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=8.0s)]
*  And that means New York Governor Kathy Hochul, Letitia James and New York's DMV chief. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=13.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=19.84s)]
*  Because of their efforts to aid and abet illegal immigration. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=20.84s)]
*  We'll have a lot more on that straight ahead. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=23.92s)]
*  And Stephen Miller will join us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=26.48s)]
*  Also breaking today, another legal win for President Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=28.0s)]
*  The Florida appeals court blasted the Pulitzer board. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=31.6s)]
*  Remember the Pulitzer prizes for the phony Russia hoax and ruled in favor of Donald Trump's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=34.76s)]
*  defamation suit. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=40.44s)]
*  That will now proceed. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=41.56s)]
*  This all stems from the Pulitzer Prize gifted to the New York Times, Washington Post for [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=43.2s)]
*  perpetuating the Russia hoax. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  By the way, just for the record, we got it right on this show. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=50.08s)]
*  They got it wrong. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, it was another day of public humiliation for Democrats. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  They're losing it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=59.0s)]
*  The woke residents of liberal Massachusetts in a town there, they are now begging to become [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=60.0s)]
*  a sanctuary city for transgender people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=65.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=68.6s)]
*  That Jesus I know would be dressed in full drag and serving face. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=70.88s)]
*  Or handsome as a trans man. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=78.08s)]
*  Or wrapped in the garb of a non-binary person who knows one gender is way too small to capture [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=81.36s)]
*  their gloriousness. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=86.92s)]
*  Okay, we've got the full highlights from that city council meeting. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=88.56s)]
*  That's all coming up straight ahead. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=93.2s)]
*  Plus, more sound yet from another congressional protest in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=94.64s)]
*  This is like a daily occurrence. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=99.56s)]
*  This time, Democratic lawmakers demanding reparations while calling President Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=101.44s)]
*  a white supremacist. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=105.72s)]
*  The only words missing were Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, fascist, and Nazi, etc. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=107.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=114.32s)]
*  Alright, a lot more coming up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=129.32s)]
*  So that is the current state of your Democratic Party. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=130.32s)]
*  This is what they're doing with their time in Washington and meanwhile at the White House. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=134.08s)]
*  Donald Trump, he's making history day after day. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=138.36s)]
*  One more American hostage was freed today, this time from Belarus. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=141.88s)]
*  Late last night, you might remember, on this program, we saw the White House arrival of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=146.28s)]
*  another hostage freed by Vladimir Putin in Russia. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=151.08s)]
*  Both hostages this week were released on unilateral deals without any conditions, no prisoner [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  swap. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=161.8s)]
*  They marked the 10th and 11th American hostages now freed during Donald Trump's first three [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=163.32s)]
*  weeks in office. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=168.16s)]
*  This is a monumental diplomatic achievement and it begs the question, what the hell was [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  Biden doing the last four years? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=175.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=177.32s)]
*  The young gentleman that I brought home yesterday after two weeks, we worked on him for two [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=178.72s)]
*  weeks, he was a fine man and he was in there for three and a half, almost four years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  And they weren't able to do a thing and I got him out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=192.48s)]
*  And as you know, I didn't pay $6 billion, I didn't pay anything, we did a trade. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=196.16s)]
*  And we did a good job, we got him out in two weeks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  It should have been out years ago. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=206.04s)]
*  Now on the campaign trail, President Trump made a promise to bring all Americans home [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=209.84s)]
*  and particularly promised his mother, 95 years old, that he would come home. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=215.6s)]
*  And he came home, promises made, promises kept. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=221.8s)]
*  Today, fake news CNN, a bewilder looking Dana Bash, poor Dana, forced to listen as career [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=224.12s)]
*  diplomats he preys on President Trump and his peace through strength agenda. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=230.6s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=235.4s)]
*  It's important to note here that this is four releases we've had in less than a month of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=236.84s)]
*  the administration. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=242.52s)]
*  It's quite extraordinary. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=243.68s)]
*  It's really a very rare thing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  We work sometimes for years to get people out. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=248.28s)]
*  I've personally worked on one of these cases for a number of years. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=251.48s)]
*  And so to see this person come out of Belarusian prison is quite extraordinary. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=254.96s)]
*  Maybe color me a skeptic that Lukashenko is somebody who just does something out of the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=261.12s)]
*  goodness of his heart. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=266.24s)]
*  There was nothing that he got at all? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=267.64s)]
*  As I said, he didn't get anything for this exchange. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  They are looking to improve their ties with us and they're making smart choices by releasing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=276.52s)]
*  these Americans and other political prisoners. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=281.24s)]
*  Now President Trump, he is turning his attention to Europe after a productive phone call, long [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  phone call today with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  President Trump believes he is ready to begin serious negotiations to end the war in Europe, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=294.2s)]
*  Ukraine versus Russia. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=299.84s)]
*  This war has gone on for far too long. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  The suffering and loss of life is almost unthinkable. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=304.44s)]
*  What Putin did to Ukraine is unforgivable, but we are at a stalemate. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=307.24s)]
*  The killing, it can go on for years and years. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=310.96s)]
*  No progress on either side. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=313.72s)]
*  The only real alternative is that both sides come to an agreement, a negotiated settlement, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=315.62s)]
*  end this war, draw lines in the sand and hopefully live in peace. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=321.36s)]
*  There is no other realistic solution. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=325.26s)]
*  Democrats certainly don't have a plan at all, but there's no doubt they will be against [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=328.2s)]
*  anything Donald Trump decides to do. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=332.96s)]
*  We see it every day with Doge and cleaning up fraud, waste, abuse, corruption in your [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=335.8s)]
*  federal government. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=341.44s)]
*  Well, that's a 90-10 issue. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=342.44s)]
*  This is one that the American people agree with. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=345.68s)]
*  An average American does not want to see their money being spent this way. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=348.04s)]
*  Yet Democrats, they continue to act like the sky is falling. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=351.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=355.52s)]
*  Elon, take your musty millions and musty Moscow rights to the moon. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=357.0s)]
*  Because if you don't, we're going to stand up, we're going to speak out, we're going [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=369.08s)]
*  to march, we're going to do anything we need to do to make sure that the people of this [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=375.32s)]
*  country understand that the CRPB is for them. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=379.96s)]
*  You get your musty hands off of our money, or we're a mouse town. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=384.16s)]
*  You musty million more. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=388.88000000000005s)]
*  He's a little busy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  He's going to rescue the astronauts that Biden and Harris abandoned. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=393.36s)]
*  They lost in space for nearly 300 days. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=396.76000000000005s)]
*  They were only supposed to be there for eight days, and we expect that mission, hopefully [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=399.24s)]
*  successfully completed by the end of March. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=403.56s)]
*  Remember, the money wasted, this is your money. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=406.20000000000005s)]
*  It is tens of billions of dollars spent on foreign countries for the advancement of the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=409.48s)]
*  Democratic Party, their radical environmentalist agenda, DEI, transgenderism, LGBTQ+, advancement, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=416.0s)]
*  and often through so-called nongovernmental organizations, NGOs. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=426.36s)]
*  But as Congressman Massey and Elon Musk are pointing out, if cutting government funding [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=432.32s)]
*  shuts down an NGO, it was never really a nongovernmental organization. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  Just this week, Doge uncovered more funding from FEMA to hotels for illegal immigrants [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  in New York City. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=448.68s)]
*  Despite the president's new executive order and ban, the bureaucrats in charge of those [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=449.96s)]
*  payments, they were rightly fired, and Secretary Noem clawed back that money. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=454.88s)]
*  But over the past four years, billions were spent. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=459.84s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=462.91999999999996s)]
*  While the storm ravaged states like North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, my state [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  of Florida, Americans were sleeping in tents in North Carolina. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=468.52s)]
*  During the winter there, FEMA was shelling out millions and millions and tens of millions [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  of dollars for illegal immigrants to stay in four-star hotels in Midtown Manhattan. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=478.4s)]
*  Maybe we could have spent that money on our school system that's failing our kids. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=484.35999999999996s)]
*  Maybe we could have deported Harris-Biden unvetted illegals. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=488.08s)]
*  Maybe we could have hired more police to make our towns and cities more safe. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=492.74s)]
*  In fact, the FEMA-funded Roosevelt Hotel was serving as a base of operations for the violent [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=496.97999999999996s)]
*  Latin American gang Trende Aragua and was used to house Lake and Riley's killer. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=503.26s)]
*  Democrats are okay with this, but not okay with Elon Musk uncovering the waste, fraud, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrfBM9UEqc&t=509.98s)]
