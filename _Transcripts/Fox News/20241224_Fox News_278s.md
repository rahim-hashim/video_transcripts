# Biden admin called out for ‘America last’ policy
**Fox News:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w)
*  Here with reaction to today's busy news day, Tennessee Senator Marcia Blackburn. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Blackburn, I think many people have questions tonight about the Panama Canal, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=6.12s)]
*  about Greenland, about President Trump issuing warnings about tariffs to comply or incentivize [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=11.08s)]
*  other countries' behaviors. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=17.52s)]
*  As a city United States senator, walk us through how this all works and why it's important. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=18.52s)]
*  Kellyanne, the American people have given President Trump a mandate. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=26.76s)]
*  They are tired of our nation not putting Americans first. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  And we have seen the Biden administration have an America last policy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=38.36s)]
*  So when it comes to dealing with the Panama Canal and making certain that China is not [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  being advantaged in this and America disadvantaged, of course, let's put this issue on the table [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=49.48s)]
*  and talk about it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=57.0s)]
*  When you talk about securing our nation, that is where Greenland comes into the conversation [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=58.04s)]
*  and being strategic and how we're going to keep this nation safe. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=64.08s)]
*  That is what Americans want to see. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=69.12s)]
*  They want to see departments that are going to be run by people who are going to treat [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=71.6s)]
*  everyone by the same rule of law. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=77.12s)]
*  And they're going to have equal access, equal treatment, equal justice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  So President Trump has a mandate. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=87.0s)]
*  It is going to be up to the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate, both in Republican control, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=89.2s)]
*  to make certain that we take action, that we support President Trump, and that we get [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=95.08s)]
*  things done for the American people. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=101.56s)]
*  Senator Blackburn, you serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  You have distinguished yourself there as a member again and again, most famously asking [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  a woman, Katanji Brown Jackson, what a woman is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=112.28s)]
*  She told you she's not a biologist, can't answer. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  She now sits on the Supreme Court. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=117.52s)]
*  But I want to talk a little bit about what President Biden did today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  Mass murders, child rapists and murderers commuting their sentences from death penalty [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  to life without parole. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=129.0s)]
*  What's the U.S. government doing to protect the U.S. Senate? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=131.48s)]
*  It is disgusting that he has done this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=134.11999999999998s)]
*  Kellyanne, what we have seen, this is an administration that has worked overtime. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=137.11999999999998s)]
*  They are the record holder in trying to make illegal acts legal. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  Look at our southern border and what has happened there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  Look at the inequity in all of these departments with two tiers of treatment, two tiers of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  access. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=156.76s)]
*  What he did in commuting these sentences to life without parole, it shows a disrespect [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=157.84s)]
*  for the rule of law, for judges, for juries and a profound disregard for the parents and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=168.0s)]
*  the loved ones of these individuals that were killed by these murderers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=175.2s)]
*  And you have to think about those families. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=181.16s)]
*  Here it is at Christmas. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=183.84s)]
*  They don't have someone that they can send a letter to or make a phone call to. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=185.4s)]
*  That person is gone because these criminals chose to take the action that they took and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  took those lives and killed and harmed and destroyed the lives of others around these. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=197.16s)]
*  very interesting that Joe Biden, in order to obstruct the Trump administration and to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=206.52s)]
*  keep them from following the law, that they went out and went forward with these commutations [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=215.84s)]
*  and moved it to life without parole rather than having these individuals, have the death [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  sentence carried out on them after they have killed policemen, service members, children, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=231.44s)]
*  raping, torturing and killing children, stabbing children. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=239.84s)]
*  Kellyanne, this shows you that Joe Biden has no regard for the rule of law and that there [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=246.32s)]
*  is such animosity in the Biden administration toward Donald Trump that they will obstruct [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=254.92s)]
*  and keep him from carrying out the will of the American people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=263.4s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=267.84s)]
*  Senator Marsha Blackburn, an amazing patriot and public servant, thank you so much for [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=268.84s)]
*  joining us tonight. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  Merry Christmas to you and your family. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  Merry Christmas to you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmhmDRTc5w&t=276.28s)]
