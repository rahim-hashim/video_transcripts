# DeSantis taps Florida AG to fill Marco Rubio’s Senate seat
**Fox News:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM)
*  All right, joining us now for an exclusive interview is the next U.S. senator from the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=0.0s)]
*  great state of Florida, my free state of Florida, the state's current attorney general, Ashley [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=4.96s)]
*  Moody. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=10.52s)]
*  She's been a longtime friend of the program. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=11.52s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, soon-to-be senator, congratulations. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=14.0s)]
*  How do you feel about the appointment? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  What are your top priorities when you get to the U.S. Senate? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=20.96s)]
*  Well, it's certainly something I'm still trying to take in. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=24.6s)]
*  It's going to be a whirlwind. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=29.52s)]
*  I'll be up in Washington beginning this weekend, hopefully take that oath sometime Monday or [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=31.08s)]
*  Tuesday, depending on when Senator Marco Rubio's resignation is effective. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=37.44s)]
*  And he has successfully confirmed as our new secretary of state, very excited for him and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=43.68s)]
*  our country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=49.08s)]
*  But, yes, we gave Governor DeSantis a hard time this morning when the announcement was [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=50.08s)]
*  made. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  They asked, how much notice did you give her? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  And he said, well, I told her last night. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=57.88s)]
*  So it has certainly been an amazing, an amazing day. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=60.2s)]
*  My family is still adjusting. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  And certainly we're making plans as a mother. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=65.64s)]
*  I still have a school-aged child. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=68.16s)]
*  We are making plans on how we are going to move forward and fight together on behalf [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=70.56s)]
*  of our country and make our family work at the same time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=76.9s)]
*  You're going to arrive, and it's going to be freezing cold temperatures. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=80.88s)]
*  I know, because I will be there with you for a number of days in D.C. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  That part of Florida, I promise you're going to miss. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  My main question, the Republicans in both the House and Senate, they have slim majorities. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=94.2s)]
*  To me, the agenda that the American people voted for is the Trump agenda. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=99.64s)]
*  They want the border wall completed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=104.56s)]
*  They want the murderers, the rapists, the terrorists, the cartel members, the gang members [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=106.68s)]
*  and people that didn't respect our laws, borders, sovereignty. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=112.5s)]
*  They want them deported. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  Americans want the economy back. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=117.9s)]
*  They want energy dominance. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=119.26s)]
*  They want constitutionalists on the bench. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=121.1s)]
*  They want peace through strength. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=123.8s)]
*  They want the next generation of warfare. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=125.22s)]
*  Do you completely agree with that agenda? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=127.72s)]
*  Are you completely on board with the Trump agenda on those main issues? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=129.78s)]
*  I believe Governor DeSantis would never have made this appointment had I not been. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=136.26s)]
*  We have been fighting those specific issues together. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=143.78s)]
*  I may be the first or the only senator currently that has served in the judicial branch, understands [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=146.7s)]
*  the need for judges that rule based on the law, not what they want the law to be or wish [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=154.5s)]
*  the law was. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=159.94s)]
*  It's just an important responsibility of the Senate to confirm justices and judges [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=162.34s)]
*  that will follow the law. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=167.94s)]
*  I'm excited about that and bring my experience as a judge. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=169.78s)]
*  And I'm excited to get started. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=173.66s)]
*  I was a warrior for immigration. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=176.62s)]
*  We've got to secure our border and make sure we're keeping our communities and cities [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=179.34s)]
*  safe and I'm proud to get up there and work with President Trump to get it done. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=185.02s)]
*  Knowing you as well as I do, I know you do a great job. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=189.94s)]
*  Congratulations Senator Ashley Moody. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226BIH3nBzM&t=196.54s)]
