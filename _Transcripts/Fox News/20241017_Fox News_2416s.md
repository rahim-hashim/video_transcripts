# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 16, 2024
**Fox News:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78)
*  Attack of the five foot four inch woman. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=0.0s)]
*  He has talked about turning the American military on the American people. He has talked about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=5.68s)]
*  going after people who are engaged in peaceful protest. He has talked about locking people up [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=10.8s)]
*  because they disagree with him. This is a democracy and in a democracy the president of the United [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=16.72s)]
*  States in the United States of America should be willing to be able to handle criticism without [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=24.08s)]
*  saying he'd lock people up for doing it. Well she was raging in that interview at the top with [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=30.88s)]
*  Brett Baer. Well I think she probably sees what all of us see that beating Trump is a lot harder [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=37.28s)]
*  than they thought and they're beginning to lose ground in key places. So now they're going back [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=43.84s)]
*  to what didn't work every other time they tried it. Obsessing over Trump's language in the hyperbole [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=49.52s)]
*  over the last 24 hours as tired as the dinosaurs spewing it. Putin is the 20th century's Adolf [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=56.32s)]
*  Hitler. What's Putin trying to do? He's trying to play Donald Trump. So I think we are in such a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=66.72s)]
*  dangerous position that Trump might become president again. President again. Going back [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=76.32s)]
*  to the Russia collusion nonsense. I mean I guess it's easier than grappling with one incontrovertible [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=85.44s)]
*  fact. Bob, Putin didn't dare invade Ukraine when Trump was president. But look this final ending [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=92.96s)]
*  smearing of Trump is just more the same. This feels like what you read in history are the last days of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=100.72s)]
*  a dictatorship. To me this would be like if there was an iPhone in the bunker in 1945. This is the kind [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=108.08s)]
*  of things you would hear. The stuff he's saying on stage in the course of this. And it's you know [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=113.68s)]
*  obviously it's incredibly dangerous. OK they're back. Now they're in Hitler's bunker. Oh my goodness. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=118.8s)]
*  Trump's tough talk is dangerous to these people. Now what about the 10 million migrants including [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=124.96s)]
*  violent criminals that Biden and Harris let waltz right into America. Is that incredibly dangerous. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  Nah. Now when they say dangerous let me tell you what they really mean. They mean that another [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=137.28s)]
*  Trump presidency will be dangerous to their grip on influence and power. And even casual political [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=143.28s)]
*  observers notice the obvious message coordination happening here from the New York Times claiming [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=151.52s)]
*  that Trump is escalating threats and offering a far less democratic form of government. I mean come [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  on. Of course Kamala's ever trusty friends at Axios they add onto the pig pile revealing the blueprint [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  for Kamala Harris's campaigns closing argument. In a nutshell let me tell you what it is. Joy and love [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  didn't do the trick. No one brought her freedom and change narrative. They weren't buying that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=179.52s)]
*  And now her brat summer is just a fear mongering fall. Axios says that she's countered Trump's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=184.72s)]
*  increasingly dark grievance filled rhetoric with warnings of what could happen if he's elected. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  A move that some former Biden aides say sounds like their own strategy. Yeah because it's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=197.28s)]
*  all been done before by Biden and it didn't work. Well look it's not the first time that she's been [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  accused of copying others work without attribution is it. She even went on tirade today trying to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=206.88s)]
*  play to the squad and people like Rachel Maddow. Now the woman whose party tried to put Donald [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=213.12s)]
*  Trump in jail is now claiming in lie after lie that he is the anti-democratic force to fear. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=218.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged. He sent a mob an armed mob to the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=227.36s)]
*  United States Capitol and he refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power. He considers [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=237.12s)]
*  any American who doesn't support him to be an enemy to our country. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=246.32s)]
*  And further he says that as commander in chief he would use our military to go after them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=252.96s)]
*  Lie lie lie lie. Go peacefully to do your march to the Capitol. Wasn't that what he said something [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  like I'm paraphrasing. Now seriously of course reverting to Biden's old strategy which is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=270.72s)]
*  Charlottesville January 6th an enemies list Hitler Putin the end of the Constitution. I mean [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  I gotta say what else do they have they have to go back to it because they sure as heck don't [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  want to talk about the massive layoffs happening across America and yet none of the anti-Trump [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  smears I think are going to change the public views on any of this. The issue that matters most [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=293.12s)]
*  in this country is the economy. But again Kamala's team thinks that scaring voters about Trump [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  is the only card they have to play. How can it possibly make Americans vote against their own [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=306.4s)]
*  pocketbooks which will obviously be doing if they vote for her. Now the polling is consistently [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=313.36s)]
*  terrible for Harris saying that 59 percent say the economy is getting worse more than twice as many [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  say it's getting better than they say it's getting better only 23 percent say it's getting better. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=326.24s)]
*  And among registered voters who say the economy is worsening Trump leads Harris by a sweeping [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=331.44s)]
*  53 points. So the spin meisters and the messaging gurus and Kamala's camp are trying to bluff [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  Americans. They have a bad card and they're playing a losing hand with a losing argument [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=346.0s)]
*  made by a woman who's never won a national primary. A woman who warns about Trump's rhetoric [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  while they casually spew the worst insults at Trump. I don't even think she really believes [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=359.92s)]
*  what she's saying none of them do. They never really have. It's all just a talking point [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  in the absence of a real record to run on and that's the angle. All right coming up [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  Kamala's campaign plagued by incompetence in a key swing state. We'll bring you all the details next. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=378.32s)]
*  Covering the Kamala campaign's been disorienting. First she was the most unpopular VP in history. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  Then she's Mrs. Messiah. Her records radical left. Then she agrees with Trump but her values haven't [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=392.16s)]
*  changed. OK. Her VPs wooing white dudes and Obama's scolding the brothers. She hid from CNN for five [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=399.36s)]
*  weeks. Then she turned down the Fox debate. Now she's playing footsie with Rogan and begging to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=408.0s)]
*  come on Fox. Well be careful what you wish for because Kamala Harris just sat down with Brett [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=413.6s)]
*  Bear for a half hour and she was roughed up so badly Pelosi's asking Joe to get back in. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=419.76000000000005s)]
*  How many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  into the country over the last three and a half years. Well I'm glad you raised the issue of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=432.72s)]
*  immigration because I agree with you. It is it is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  have and you know what I'm going to talk about. Yeah but do you just a number do you think it's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=442.72s)]
*  one million three million. Brett let's just get to the point. OK. The point is that we have a broken [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  immigration system that needs to be repaired. So your Homeland Security secretary said that 85 percent [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  of apprehensions. I'm not finished. We have a we have a rough estimate of six million people have [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  been released into the country. And let me just finish I'll get to the question I promise you. I [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  was beginning to answer. And when when you came into office your administration immediately [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=469.76s)]
*  reversed a number of Trump border policies. So looking back do you regret the decision [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=474.0s)]
*  to terminate remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration. The first bill practically [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=480.56s)]
*  within hours of taking the oath was a bill to fix our immigration system. Yes ma'am it was called [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=487.52s)]
*  the U.S. Citizen Citizenship Act of 2021. It was essentially a pathway to citizenship. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  May I finish responding please. But you have to let me finish. You had the White House and the House [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=501.28s)]
*  and the Senate and they didn't bring up that bill. I'm in the middle of responding to the point you're [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=506.08s)]
*  raising. And I'd like to finish. Yes ma'am. We recognized from day one that to the point of this [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  being your first question it is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=518.4s)]
*  And our focus has been on fixing a problem. This was the first time the vice president [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=525.68s)]
*  and the Democrat nominee had ever had to answer for herself. She spent more time defending herself [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  with Brett than she has defending the actual border. Then it got personal. Former President [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=538.4s)]
*  Clinton actually referred to Lake and Riley Sunday campaigning for you in Georgia saying [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  if those men had been properly vetted Lake and Riley probably would not have been killed. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=548.0s)]
*  So if it wouldn't have happened this is well before any negotiation. This is well before [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=552.72s)]
*  Donald Trump got involved in the politics. This is a specific policy decision by your administration [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=558.32s)]
*  to release these men into the country. So what I'm saying to you do you owe those families an apology. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=563.76s)]
*  Let me just say first of all those are tragic cases. There's no question about that. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=570.56s)]
*  There is no question about that and I can't imagine the pain that the families of those victims have [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=577.12s)]
*  experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. So that is true. It is also true [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=584.64s)]
*  that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago it would be nine months [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  that we would have had more border agents at the border more support for the folks who are working [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=600.4000000000001s)]
*  around the clock trying to hold it all together. Brett Baer is giving Kamala an opportunity to say [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=607.12s)]
*  if she were president Lake and Riley would have been alive. Kamala should have said that's [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=613.2s)]
*  something I would have done differently than Biden. I would have secured the border much earlier [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=618.6400000000001s)]
*  but I was just the VP serving at the pleasure of the president and if you vote for me I promise [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=623.44s)]
*  I'll protect women like Lake and Riley. At this stage of the campaign saying I'm sorry about the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=628.72s)]
*  dead woman on my watch it's all Trump's fault it's not going to fly. Harris has never been [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=634.96s)]
*  pressed this hard on her border policies and it continued. Madam Vice President it was a policy [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  decision in the early part of your administration. I will let one of the mothers talk about it. Take [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  a listen. Because of the Biden-Harris administration open border policies catch and release they were [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=652.96s)]
*  enrolled in the alternatives to detention program. This meant that they were released into the United [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=660.4000000000001s)]
*  States. It was not even a full three weeks later that they would take my daughter Jocelyn Nungare's [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  life. I believe the Biden-Harris administration open border policies are responsible for the death [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=671.36s)]
*  of my daughter. That's the early days so do you owe them an apology is what I'm saying. I will [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=676.8s)]
*  tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. I'm so sorry for her loss sincerely but let's talk about [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=683.28s)]
*  what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=693.28s)]
*  Let's talk about that as well. But do you want to answer that? In all fairness I told you I feel awful [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=700.16s)]
*  what she and her family have experienced. During that time you said repeatedly that the border was [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=706.8s)]
*  secure. When in your mind did it start becoming a crisis? I think it we've had a broken immigration [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=711.68s)]
*  system transcending by the way Donald Trump's administration even before. Let's let's all be [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system. I've been [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  clear I think we all are that it needs to be fixed. Kamala just said the border has always been broken [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  but it was secure for three years when Lake and Riley was murdered. That doesn't make any sense. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=736.8s)]
*  How did Trump break the border that you said was secure? You can't follow Kamala's logic because [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=743.5999999999999s)]
*  there is none. She doesn't know anything about the border. She doesn't care about the border. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=749.04s)]
*  She just doesn't want anyone talking about it. Her whole interview was a continuation of a cover-up. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=753.3599999999999s)]
*  Watch. Madam Vice President, you call Donald Trump. Let's not diminish the significance of that. You call Donald Trump [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=759.2s)]
*  he's misguided. You say now he's unstable. He is unstable. He's not well. You say he's mentally [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=766.32s)]
*  not stable. He's not stable. Let me ask you this. You told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=773.12s)]
*  game that ran around circles on his staff. When did you first notice that President Biden's mental [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=779.12s)]
*  faculties appeared diminished? Joe Biden I have watched in from the Oval Office to the Situation [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=784.64s)]
*  Room and he has the judgment and the experiment and experience to do exactly what he has done in [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  making very important decisions on behalf of the American people. There were no concerns raised. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=801.76s)]
*  Joe Biden is not on the ballot. I understand. Donald Trump is. But you talked about it. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=807.04s)]
*  After George Clooney said within a few minutes of talking to President Biden at a fundraiser that he [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=812.56s)]
*  thought this was not the same Joe Biden that we saw on the debate stage. Donald Trump is on the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=817.1999999999999s)]
*  ballot. I understand. You met with him at least once a week for three and a half years. You didn't [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=822.16s)]
*  have any concerns? I think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump. So Kamala Harris [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  didn't want to talk about Kamala Harris and she definitely didn't want to talk about Joe Biden. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=834.4s)]
*  She never once touted the accomplishments of the Biden administration. Not a single one. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=839.76s)]
*  She just wants to prosecute Donald Trump. But America doesn't want to prosecute her. We want [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=845.28s)]
*  a president. At one point she just snapped. This is a democracy and in a democracy the president [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=849.76s)]
*  of the United States in the United States of America should be willing to be able to handle [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=858.8s)]
*  criticism without saying he'd lock people up for doing it. And this is what is at stake, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=865.1999999999999s)]
*  which is why you have someone like the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=871.28s)]
*  saying what Mark Milley has said about Donald Trump being a threat to the United States of America. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  Why didn't we see anger like that about the border? About prices? About crime? Never kind of [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=884.4799999999999s)]
*  showed that flash of anger when it was affecting millions of Americans. She wasn't likable. She [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=890.16s)]
*  wasn't charming. She was never funny. She wasn't warm. There was nothing gracious, eloquent or [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=896.3199999999999s)]
*  reassuring about this performance. Then Brett asked her the question that she's had a week, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=902.0799999999999s)]
*  actually the whole campaign to think about. Watch this. So you're not Joe Biden. You're not Donald [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=907.1999999999999s)]
*  Trump. But nothing comes to mind that you would do differently? Let me be very clear. My presidency [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=913.12s)]
*  will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency. And like every new president that [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=918.64s)]
*  comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences and [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=924.4s)]
*  fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership. I, for example, am someone who has [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=930.96s)]
*  not spent the majority of my career in Washington, D.C. She spent eight years in Washington, D.C. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=938.16s)]
*  That's twice as long as Trump. And what would you do differently? She said she'd bring fresh new ideas. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=944.08s)]
*  Then she never said what the ideas were. Your campaign slogan is a new way forward and it's [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=951.44s)]
*  time to turn the page. You've been vice president for three and a half years. So what are you turning [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=957.44s)]
*  the page from? Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=962.96s)]
*  burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=970.88s)]
*  to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. That is turning the [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=977.52s)]
*  page. That is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of, Brett. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=984.56s)]
*  If you're turning the page, you've been in office for three and a half years. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=991.04s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been running for office. But you've been the person holding the office. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=995.4399999999999s)]
*  Come on. You and I both know what I'm talking about. You and I both know what I'm talking about. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1000.7199999999999s)]
*  I actually don't. What are you talking about? What I'm talking about is that over the last decade, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1005.4399999999999s)]
*  people have become... But you're the lever of power. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1010.7199999999999s)]
*  But listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me and certainly the Republicans who are on stage [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1012.16s)]
*  with me, the former chief of staff to the president, Donald Trump, former defense secretaries, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1019.52s)]
*  national security advisor and his vice president, one that he is unfit to serve, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1027.68s)]
*  that he is unstable, that he is dangerous. So turning the page isn't turning the page [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1032.48s)]
*  from Biden. She's going to do everything the same. She's just turning the page from Trump [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1038.08s)]
*  who wasn't in office. Her slogans don't even make sense because 79% of the country wants to turn the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1044.08s)]
*  page from her. This is what an actual Kamala Harris interview should look like. Brett gave [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1050.8s)]
*  her the same treatment as he gave Trump in the spring. Respectful, firm and persistent. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1058.48s)]
*  We didn't swap her answers to make her look better like CBS. We didn't invite little Timmy [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1064.48s)]
*  along to hold her hand like CNN. This was a big girl interview and she flopped. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1070.08s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity and well, desperate times. They call for desperate measures at [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1075.1999999999998s)]
*  the Harris campaign. Only hours ago, Kamala Harris sat down for a very tough live to tape interview [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1079.52s)]
*  right here on the Fox News channel with our very own Brett Baer. Coming up, Brett Baer will join us [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1085.6799999999998s)]
*  with an exclusive recap of that interview. Now, unlike the pro-Kamala state-run fake news media [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1090.72s)]
*  and other people that call themselves journalists, he asked tough, fair questions. He insisted on real [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1098.0s)]
*  answers in a short period of time, a short window that they gave him about very important topics. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1104.64s)]
*  He didn't let Kamala off the hook. He pressed her. He pressed her repeatedly. Needless to say, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1110.48s)]
*  I'd say the joy is gone in the Harris campaign tonight and her obvious anger, that was on full [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1115.92s)]
*  display. The one she's notorious for, that was on full display during the interview. Kamala appeared [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1121.76s)]
*  agitated, obsessively tried to simply avoid answering basic fundamental questions. She took [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1127.04s)]
*  zero responsibility for anything that has happened during the Harris Biden administration. And when [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1133.84s)]
*  all else would fail, she'd either flat out lie or go to the default campaign mode. If the dog bites, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1139.76s)]
*  if the bee stings, if you're feeling sad, just blame Donald Trump for everything. Even the border [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1146.6399999999999s)]
*  crisis that she and Joe Biden caused. Take a look. How many illegal immigrants would you [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1152.08s)]
*  estimate your administration has released into the country over the last three and a half years? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1159.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you raised the issue of immigration because I agree with you. It is a topic of [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1165.28s)]
*  discussion that people want to rightly have. And you know what I'm going to talk about. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1170.24s)]
*  Yeah, but do you just a number. Do you think it's one million, three million? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1175.76s)]
*  Brett, let's just get to the point. Okay. The point is that we have a broken immigration system. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1179.28s)]
*  When you came into office, your administration immediately reversed a number of Trump border [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1185.6s)]
*  policies. Most significantly the policy that required illegal immigrants to be detained [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1189.6s)]
*  through deportation, either in the U S or in Mexico. And you switched that policy. They were [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1195.36s)]
*  released from custody awaiting trial. So instead included in those were a large number of single [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1201.2s)]
*  men, adult men who went on to commit heinous crimes. So looking back, do you regret the decision [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1207.92s)]
*  to terminate remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1215.6000000000001s)]
*  At the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1220.0s)]
*  the first bill that we offered Congress before we worked on infrastructure, before the inflation [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1227.04s)]
*  reduction act, before the chips and science act, before any, before the bipartisan safer communities [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1234.96s)]
*  act. The first bill practically within hours of taking the oath was a bill to fix our immigration [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1242.4s)]
*  system. Yes ma'am. It was called the U S citizen citizenship act of 2021. Exactly. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1249.76s)]
*  Well, here's the truth and let us not have revisionist history, shall we? Because on day one, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1256.32s)]
*  simply with the stroke of a pen, not an act of Congress, the Harris Biden White House, they [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1262.96s)]
*  reversed all of Donald Trump's border protections with executive orders and then they bragged about [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1267.92s)]
*  it and they lied about the border being secure for three years. But take a look at this. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1274.64s)]
*  So we have rescinded so many Trump immigration policies. It would take so much time to list them. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1279.04s)]
*  We rescinded the remain in Mexico policy. We rescinded, of course, the public charge rule that [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1287.28s)]
*  deprived vulnerable migrants from accessing certain critical life benefits. We have restored [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1295.2s)]
*  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the DACA program. We have rescinded so many [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  and have restored so many that he really dismantled. That's what they did on day one. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1311.92s)]
*  And she didn't answer Brett Baer's question on how many illegal immigrants unvetted. Did they [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1320.64s)]
*  allow another country? Well, the answer is over 12 million unvetted. Harris Biden illegal immigrants [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1325.92s)]
*  allowed inside of our country, all with the stroke of a pen. Many were violent criminals who committed [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1332.16s)]
*  heinous acts, as Brett pointed out, against American citizens. Dozens of Americans dead, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1337.68s)]
*  dozens have been raped, including children, hundreds of others victims of violent crime. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1343.52s)]
*  The cost through the roof. Three young women that were mentioned during the interview, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1348.0800000000002s)]
*  Rachel Nungary, Lakin Riley, Rachel Moran, mother of five, allegedly murdered by these suspected [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1353.04s)]
*  illegal aliens. Others, again, murdered, raped victims of violent crime because of their failure [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1359.44s)]
*  to secure the border. And of course, they rescinded every Trump policy. But don't expect an apology [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1365.52s)]
*  to the families of these victims from Kamala Harris. Take a look. Jocelyn Nungary, Rachel Moran, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1372.56s)]
*  Lakin Riley, they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1379.36s)]
*  released at the beginning of the administration, well before a negotiated bipartisan bill. This is [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1385.04s)]
*  a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country. So what I'm [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1391.44s)]
*  saying to you, do you owe those families an apology? Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1397.04s)]
*  There's no question about that. There is no question about that. And I can't imagine [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1405.76s)]
*  the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1412.56s)]
*  So that is true. It is also true that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1420.96s)]
*  it would be nine months that we would have had more border agents at the border. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1430.16s)]
*  So do you owe them an apology is what I'm saying. I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1435.92s)]
*  I am so sorry for her loss, sincerely. But let's talk about what is happening right now with an [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1441.68s)]
*  individual who does not want to participate in solutions. Let's talk about that as well. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1451.44s)]
*  But do you want to answer that? In all fairness, I told you, I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1457.3600000000001s)]
*  No apology. And the bill she's referring to would allow almost two million illegal immigrants into the country and amnesty. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1464.3999999999999s)]
*  And a lot of people opposed it. And they had control of both houses of Congress. As Rep pointed out, even Bill Clinton, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1473.52s)]
*  while campaigning for Kamala Harris, admitted Lake and Riley would be alive today if her killer had been [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1480.0s)]
*  properly vetted by the Harris Biden administration, is what he said. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1487.92s)]
*  You had a case in Georgia not very long ago, didn't you? They made an ad about a young woman who'd been killed by an immigrant. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1493.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1501.3600000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, the borders are Kamala Harris takes zero responsibility for the border crisis. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1506.16s)]
*  And she also doesn't seem to remember calling the border secure, something she repeated along with [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  everyone else in the administration for three long years, or calling for illegal immigration to be decriminalized. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1516.96s)]
*  Take a look. You said repeatedly that the border was secure. When in your mind did it start becoming a crisis? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1524.48s)]
*  I think we've had a broken immigration system transcending, by the way, Donald Trump's administration even before. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1532.48s)]
*  Let's all be honest about that. When it comes to immigration, you supported allowing immigrants [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1538.8s)]
*  in the country illegally to apply for driver's license, to qualify for free tuition at universities, to be enrolled in free health care. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1544.5600000000002s)]
*  Do you still support those things? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1552.0s)]
*  Listen, that was five years ago, and I'm very clear that I will follow the law. I have made that statement over and over again. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1554.0s)]
*  And as vice president of the United States, that's exactly what I've done, not to mention before. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1560.16s)]
*  You, if that's the case, you chose a running mate, Tim Walz, who, governor of Minnesota, who signed those very things into state law. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1565.1200000000001s)]
*  So decriminalizing border crossings, like you said in 2019. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1572.08s)]
*  I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings, and I've not done that as vice president. I will not do that as president. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1576.3999999999999s)]
*  So these are evolutions that you've had. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1583.52s)]
*  Not a matter of following the law. You stated you wanted to change the law. You want to be president. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1586.8799999999999s)]
*  Since Kamala's trying to duck, dodge, and weave the question and blame Trump and avoid scrutiny, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1592.32s)]
*  let's take a look at what really happened. You decide. Take a look. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1597.4399999999998s)]
*  Would you call the border secure? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1601.52s)]
*  I think that there is no question that we have to do what the president and I asked Congress to do is the first request we made. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1604.2399999999998s)]
*  Pass [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1614.0s)]
*  a bill [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1616.1599999999999s)]
*  to create a pathway to citizenship. The border is secure. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1618.08s)]
*  We have to have a secure border, but I am in favor of saying that we're not going to treat people [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1621.12s)]
*  who are undocumented across the border as criminals. That's correct. That is correct. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1626.2399999999998s)]
*  You support giving [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1629.8400000000001s)]
*  universal health care, Medicare for all, to people who are in this country illegally? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1631.68s)]
*  Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1635.28s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1637.76s)]
*  that would deny in our country any human being [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1640.0800000000002s)]
*  from access to public safety, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1643.8400000000001s)]
*  public education, or public health, period. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1647.2s)]
*  Now, Kamala supported taxpayer-funded sex change operations for not only convicts, but illegal immigrants [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1650.96s)]
*  and jail and other inmates. But when Brett Baer asked about this, you know, bizarre position that I don't think any American can support, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1658.08s)]
*  can you guess what she did? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1666.1599999999999s)]
*  Blame Donald Trump, the guy that built the wall, implemented the stay in Mexico policies, and had the lowest illegal immigration in modern history. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1667.76s)]
*  Never supported taxpayer-funded sex change operations for illegal immigrants, but you got to give her an A for effort. Take a look. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1677.04s)]
*  Are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1684.72s)]
*  I will follow the law. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1692.0800000000002s)]
*  And it's a law that Donald Trump actually followed. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1694.16s)]
*  You're probably familiar with, now it's a public report, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1697.52s)]
*  that under Donald Trump's administration, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1701.28s)]
*  these surgeries were available to, on a medical necessity basis, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1703.76s)]
*  to people in the federal prison system. And I think frankly that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1710.1599999999999s)]
*  you know stones when you're living in a glass house. The Trump aides say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1717.9199999999998s)]
*  surgeries happened during his presidency. Well, you know what you got to take responsibility for what happened in your administration. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1724.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no surgeries happened in his presidency. It's in black and white. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1728.24s)]
*  Wow, she's just flat out lying. In fact, the very first taxpayer-funded [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1732.7199999999998s)]
*  sex change surgery on a convicted felon was carried out in 2022. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1737.38s)]
*  Yeah, thanks to the Harris-Biden administration. Think about that. Under Kamala Harris, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1742.42s)]
*  your hard-earned tax dollars being spent on costly breast augmentation [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1747.3s)]
*  and other gender altering surgeries to convicted murderers, other felons in prison, and she wants it for illegal immigrants. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1753.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, two-thirds of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1760.82s)]
*  barely getting by amid historic levels of inflation. Last month, 3.3 percent inflation up year over year. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1764.8200000000002s)]
*  In his interview, Brett featured this statistic showing a whopping 79 percent of you. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1772.42s)]
*  The American people believe this country is on the wrong track after nearly four years under Harris and Biden. According to Kamala, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1779.38s)]
*  that's actually Donald Trump's fault too. Can't make it up. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1788.02s)]
*  More than 70 percent of people tell the country is on the wrong track. They say the country is on the wrong track. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1792.26s)]
*  If it's on the wrong track, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1798.5s)]
*  that track follows three and a half years of you being vice president and President Biden being president. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1800.98s)]
*  That is what they're saying. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1807.06s)]
*  79 percent of them. Why are they saying that? If you're turning the page, you've been in office for three and a half years. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1808.6599999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been running for office [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1815.86s)]
*  But you've been the person holding the office. Come on. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1819.46s)]
*  You and I both know what I'm talking about. You and I both know what I'm talking about. I actually don't. What are you talking about? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1821.78s)]
*  What I'm talking about is that over the last decade, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1826.74s)]
*  people have become... [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1831.1399999999999s)]
*  You're vice president for three and a half years. What is she talking about? No wonder she showed up late. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1834.26s)]
*  They gave Brett very limited time. Kamala Harris is clearly in a state of denial, living in an alternate universe, if you will, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1839.86s)]
*  where everything bad that ever happened in her administration is the fault of Donald Trump. She wants to believe [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1847.8600000000001s)]
*  that because Donald Trump just breathes air and exists, that things started just happening under her watch. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1854.42s)]
*  Now two new wars we have going on. War in Europe, war in the Middle East, a historic border crisis. It is real. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1861.8600000000001s)]
*  A disaster and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan. She was the last person in the room. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1868.5s)]
*  Record-setting inflation that only recently she acknowledges and pledges she will deal with on day one, which was January 20th, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1873.46s)]
*  2021. And [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1881.6000000000001s)]
*  backbreaking gas prices. Massive [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1883.6200000000001s)]
*  disruptions in our supply chain. And I can go on all night. It was clear from day one, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1886.0800000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden was not up to the job. Not mentally, not cognitively, physically. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1891.46s)]
*  And Kamala was more than happy to look the other way and frankly flat-out lied to all of us. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1896.5s)]
*  Take a look at this answer. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1902.02s)]
*  And we give thanks to our commander in chief, the president of the United States, the extraordinary [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1903.22s)]
*  president of the United States, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1910.34s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1912.66s)]
*  Happy Independence Day. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1918.66s)]
*  I'm not being facetious. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1932.74s)]
*  Well, President Harris led this effort. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1934.98s)]
*  Led this effort to make things better. And a pound of Ukrainian people, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1937.7s)]
*  proud, proud people, pound for pound, ready to fight with every inch of earnings that they have. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1942.58s)]
*  If Kamala will lie for three years about the cognitive abilities of the president of our country, the president of the United States of America, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1949.62s)]
*  you know, what won't she lie about? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1958.42s)]
*  Today in Georgia, Donald Trump sat down for a town hall with an all-female audience. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1960.74s)]
*  They would have asked me to appear, but they didn't want everyone fainting. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1966.1000000000001s)]
*  Of course, Kamala also wanted to do a town hall with just women, but her staff couldn't define one. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1970.18s)]
*  After banning pub crawls due to public complaints, people are accusing Prague [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1976.5s)]
*  of becoming a nanny state. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1981.8600000000001s)]
*  Did someone say nanny? asks one man. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1984.9s)]
*  According to a newly revised FBI stats, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1990.9s)]
*  violent crime in America has actually gone up, not down, as Democrats claim. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1995.94s)]
*  Kamala Harris is now promising that if elected, she will ban math. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2001.0600000000002s)]
*  Reports say Donald Trump may work at a McDonald's during a campaign stop in PA. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2008.5800000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kamala will also spend a day at a job she's never worked, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2013.46s)]
*  vice president. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2017.78s)]

*  According to a report from the Public Interest Legal Foundation, hundreds of Arizona voters [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2026.66s)]
*  allegedly registered to vote using strip clubs, abortion clinics, and high schools as home addresses. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2031.92s)]
*  Or as Hunter calls it, great places to meet babes. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2040.1000000000001s)]
*  According to a new documentary, Christopher Columbus may have been Jewish. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2043.22s)]
*  Yeah, instead of searching for a new route to the Far East, he was only looking for a restaurant that's open on Christmas. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2047.78s)]
*  And finally, a Disney World cake shop is under fire for having prices that start at $22 per slice. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2058.66s)]
*  You mean I have to spend $22 on a cake? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2067.7s)]
*  $22 per slice. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2069.7s)]
*  You mean I have to spend $220 for dinner? Asks one man? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2072.18s)]
*  All right. Why not? He loves it. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2080.66s)]
*  All right. So border patrol agents are vowing that they're going to leave in droves if Kamala wins in November. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2087.22s)]
*  This follows the earlier endorsement of Donald Trump by the Border Patrol Union. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2093.8599999999997s)]
*  Strange. You'd think the person labeled the border czar would have had this endorsement all sewn up. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2098.5s)]
*  She should have been a shoe in like me for best abs at the Teen Choice Awards. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2104.82s)]
*  I got robbed. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2110.98s)]
*  Truth is, all these border patrol officers fleeing their jobs will be joining a herd of others fleeing their life's work, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2113.3s)]
*  because they know the Dems don't want them doing it. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2119.94s)]
*  It's mostly men fleeing traditional male jobs, cops, firemen, teamsters, jobs that often involve serious physical labor or upper body strength. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2122.58s)]
*  You know, I never realized it before, but upper body strength is kind of sexist. I guess God was a misogynist. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2131.94s)]
*  Wow, that didn't work. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2139.7799999999997s)]
*  Bottom line, those who go into professions like these do it for the mission, not the money. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2145.06s)]
*  There's not a buttload of Border Patrol whose other car is a Lamborghini. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2151.54s)]
*  And if you take that mission away by denigrating the work they do, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2156.5800000000004s)]
*  you can expect a rush for the exits that you usually see at a Jets game by the third quarter. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2159.7000000000003s)]
*  And the Dems are wondering why they're doing poorly with men. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2166.98s)]
*  Well, you can try not labeling their central purpose as evil, maybe less redefining and more respecting. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2169.86s)]
*  Stop saying they're whipping people when it's just Larry Kudlow. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2176.34s)]
*  Now what if the teachers or nurses unions made a similar statement that if Trump were elected they would walk off the job? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2182.26s)]
*  Can you imagine the level of media hand-wringing screeching about Trump not valuing the work of these heroes? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2188.5800000000004s)]
*  And yes, I know there are male nurses and teachers. They're always hitting on me. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2194.7400000000002s)]
*  And there are female cops and firefighters too. Although I would prefer it's a man who carries me out of my burning apartment. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2201.46s)]
*  Preferably Ryan Gosling. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2208.5600000000004s)]
*  But whatever your gender is, I respect you for doing these jobs. I don't want to do them. That's for sure. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2212.1000000000004s)]
*  You think I want to run up a flight of stairs into a burning building to grab my bodybuilding trophies? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2217.94s)]
*  That's what personal assistants are for and I'm gonna wait in the limo. Thank you very much. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2222.9s)]
*  But we need these jobs and the Dems need to stop villainizing them. How demoralized does the Border Patrol feel? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2227.86s)]
*  Well, according to the Washington Examiner, they've lost more than 4,000 personnel since 2020. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2234.26s)]
*  That's almost 20 percent of their workforce. Meanwhile, police departments nationwide cannot recruit or retain their headcount. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2239.9399999999996s)]
*  It's the hidden version of defunding. Tens of thousands of cop salaries have been saved [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2246.74s)]
*  because they never took the job to begin with. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2252.3399999999997s)]
*  They made it a job Americans truly don't want to do. Like working for Kamala Harris. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2254.8199999999997s)]
*  She's lost more employees than the Titanic. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2261.62s)]
*  Wow, frankly. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2266.5s)]
*  Frankly, it's a miracle any cop still shows up for work. AOC must be skipping down Broadway with her bodyguards, of course. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2270.02s)]
*  Thanks to no cash bail and other criminal coddling reforms, arrested perps are back on the street before you can say, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2278.58s)]
*  hey, where the f**k is my wallet? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2284.8199999999997s)]
*  But imagine that whatever you do for a living is every day undone before your day is over. I think my writers can relate to that. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2287.62s)]
*  But what would you, what would that do to your morale? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2295.14s)]
*  How must it feel to stand out on the southern border under the baking sun trying to guard the nation from a legal entrance [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2298.2599999999998s)]
*  only to be told that you're the problem? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2305.38s)]
*  Remember this gem from Kamala? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2308.5s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question that we've got to critically re-examine [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2311.7s)]
*  ICE and its role and the way that it is being administered and the work it is doing and we need to probably think about starting from scratch [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2315.22s)]
*  because [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2322.5s)]
*  there's a lot that is wrong with the way that it's conducting itself and we need to deal with that. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2324.26s)]
*  Now to be fair, she is a moron. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2330.1800000000003s)]
*  But [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2334.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, oh [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2337.2200000000003s)]
*  I feel dirty and I should. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2340.1800000000003s)]
*  But the entire agency charged with handling cartels and other migrant criminals is, in Kamala world, what's really illegal. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2342.5800000000004s)]
*  Maybe that's why Customs and Border Patrol had 15 suicides in 2022 alone, forcing them to hire their first [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2349.38s)]
*  suicidologist. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2357.36s)]
*  I think the View had to hire one for all of those men working their cameras. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2358.98s)]
*  But that's what happens when the mission loses its value. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2364.9s)]
*  When you're not only told that the work you believed in is evil, but that you've been the bad guy all along. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2367.78s)]
*  And yes, generally that means guy, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2372.82s)]
*  you know, as in those evil monsters with the Y chromosome lumbering around among us. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2374.9s)]
*  So the Dems and the media can try to redefine masculinity all they want. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2380.02s)]
*  They could pay actors to play real men for Kamala all day long, but it's failing [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2384.42s)]
*  because no matter who wins next month, the real truth is [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2389.78s)]
*  real men and real women know how much we need Border Patrol officers and men like them. The truth is we can't do without them [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2392.82s)]
*  unlike Kamala. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2400.7400000000002s)]
