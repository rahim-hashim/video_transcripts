# Hannity: This became inevitable after there was no response from President Biden
**Fox News:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI)
*  Welcome to Hannity Busy Monday night, the border showdown in Texas. That is heating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=0.0s)]
*  up. It is now a constitutional crisis and a national security crisis. And Governor Greg [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  Abbott, he's not backing down. He will join us with the very latest. Plus the possible [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=15.4s)]
*  Senate border deal would be a disaster for the country. We're going to tell you why every [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=20.16s)]
*  Republican senator should be strongly opposed to it. But first, American soldiers abroad [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=25.54s)]
*  are under attack. Three brave members of the U.S. Army, they were killed and we had what, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=30.86s)]
*  over 40 more injured in a drone attack on a base in Jordan yesterday. One official is [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=37.22s)]
*  now saying that the drone evaded U.S. defenses because it was mistaken for an American drone. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  Well, that begs the question, what's going on with our military? We know our defense [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=48.54s)]
*  secretary spent days in the ICU. The commander in chief had no knowledge of it at all. Now [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=52.78s)]
*  there are three soldiers dead because of a drone proxy from an Iranian proxy, was mistaken for a [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=58.7s)]
*  U.S. one. Now since October the 17th, there have been at least 165 attacks carried out on our U.S. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=65.78s)]
*  forces. You see the locations on your screen. How many more times do American troops need to be [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  targeted and attacked before we have a president that will take action and defend them? After all [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=79.24s)]
*  the previous attacks and no response from President Joe, this now became inevitable, just like no [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=84.88s)]
*  consequences ever for Russia or China or Iran. All these groups causing chaos and destruction in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=91.24s)]
*  the Middle East. You have Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels. They're all funded and backed by [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror. Former President Trump called out Biden for his weakness on [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  truth social, saying quote, this brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=110.18s)]
*  consequence of Joe Biden's weakness and surrender. And speaking in South Carolina yesterday, Biden had [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=117.22000000000001s)]
*  an opportunity to send a strong message to his friends, his pals, the mullahs in Iran in the wake [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  of these deadly attacks, but instead he offered nothing but this tepid response. Take a listen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=129.78s)]
*  And we shall respond. This is pretty much par for the course with this administration, who, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=159.78s)]
*  instead of using forceful deterrence, just had a simple message for Iran all along. Their message, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=176.34s)]
*  whenever asked, well, what about Iran? Don't, don't, don't watch. What is your message to Hezbollah [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=182.66s)]
*  and its backer Iran? Don't, don't, don't, don't. And what's the message to Iran? Don't. As President [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=190.82s)]
*  Biden said, just don't. Exactly. One word, pretty straightforward. It was very important to send a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=201.3s)]
*  very clear message to anyone who might seek to take advantage of the conflict in Gaza to threaten [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=208.58s)]
*  our personnel here or anywhere else in the region. Don't do it. I've already delivered the message [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=215.22000000000003s)]
*  to Iran. They know not to do anything. Oh, now they know not to do anything. Don't becomes do [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=224.82000000000002s)]
*  and nothing happens. Big shock. The strategy didn't work. Why would Iran, the world's largest [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  state sponsor, terrorism, stop? There are no consequences for all their actions. Joe Biden's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=236.34s)]
*  weakness is the reason that the country of Iran and China and the country of Russia are so emboldened. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=242.02s)]
*  It is the reason we woke up yesterday to three dead soldiers and dozens others injured. Joe Biden [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=249.3s)]
*  is the appeaser in chief. Once again, Joe Biden, if he didn't respond the other, what, 175 times, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=256.1s)]
*  what would the Iranians expect? Nothing. That's why he has blood on his hands. He has caused this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=263.38s)]
*  This administration has reportedly turned a blind eye to Iran getting rich with their surging oil [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=270.18s)]
*  sales, even as they remain under Western sanctions. That's basically Joe allowing them, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=276.26s)]
*  you know, to bring billions of dollars into their coffers again to sponsor more terror. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=281.38s)]
*  Biden gave Iran, what, $6 billion as ransom payment and a prisoner swap. Then the Biden [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=286.58s)]
*  administration renewed a sanctions waiver, giving Iran access to another $10 billion, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=293.3s)]
*  in this case from Iraq, in exchange for electricity sales. Biden is only enabling and appeasing Iran [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  and their ability to fund terror groups. And the world better pay attention because that same [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  country, Iran, is desperately trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And by the way, they have now [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=312.9s)]
*  aligned themselves with both Russia and China. Would you be shocked if Russia and China would [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=318.1s)]
*  help them with their nuclear program? Because I would not. They are now enriching uranium, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=323.70000000000005s)]
*  almost to the point of being weapons grade. That's at least according to the latest assessment. I [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=328.82000000000005s)]
*  don't know if anybody really knows, but that is what appeasement does. As Senator Tom Cotton said [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=333.38s)]
*  in a statement yesterday, Joe Biden emboldened Iran for years by tolerating attacks on our troops, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=338.66s)]
*  bribing the Ayatollahs with billions of dollars and appeasing them to no end. He left our troops as [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=344.5s)]
*  sitting ducks and now three Americans are dead and dozens now others are wounded. And sadly, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=351.06s)]
*  I've been predicting this would happen for months. So that's what Tom Cotton said. So we. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=357.94s)]
*  And then to make matters worse, according to NBC News, the administration is discussing the idea [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=362.82s)]
*  of slowing some weaponry to Israel, what, to pressure them into scaling back their military [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=367.94s)]
*  operations in Gaza after the worst terrorist attack in their history, instead of saying, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=373.54s)]
*  we support your war against terror. That's all you have to do, Joe. What is happening in the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=378.66s)]
*  Middle East is devastating. And sadly, all of it preventable were it not for Joe's failed and very [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=383.46000000000004s)]
