# Tomi Lahren: The Democratic Party wants 'these videos on a loop' to get rid of Biden
**Fox News:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA)
*  Here with more is Fox News contributor Mary Katherine Hamm and host of outkicks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tommy Lahren is fearless. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=5.28s)]
*  Tommy Lahren. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=6.84s)]
*  Tommy, I think I'm being fair. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=7.84s)]
*  I can't understand—that's the best pronunciation we can come up with. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=10.52s)]
*  We've listened very closely. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  We've slowed it down and listened to it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=16.12s)]
*  We put it in there phonetically. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=18.96s)]
*  And I'm trying to give them an opportunity to come on the air and explain what the words [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=21.04s)]
*  are, because I can't explain them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=25.92s)]
*  Is that a cheap fake video? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=28.16s)]
*  No, it's very real. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Maybe it's a new language we haven't heard of yet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=32.8s)]
*  A lot of illegal immigrants coming across their borders, speaking languages we're unfamiliar [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=35.24s)]
*  with. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=39.84s)]
*  But Sean, I actually think that the Democrat Party and those in the media that do the bidding [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=40.84s)]
*  of the Democrat Party, I think they want you to play those videos. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=44.96s)]
*  I think that they want you and Fox News and honest media to play those videos on a loop, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=48.8s)]
*  because quite frankly, I think they want to get rid of Joe, as you know. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=55.64s)]
*  And I think this might be their way of doing it, because all week long we've been talking [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=59.88s)]
*  about these supposed cheap fake videos. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=64.24s)]
*  And a lot of Americans that didn't see them initially, didn't see them from conservative [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=67.16s)]
*  accounts on Twitter, because the media is talking about them ad nauseum, they're actually [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=70.76s)]
*  going and they're watching them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=75.52s)]
*  All right, but let me ask you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=76.52s)]
*  So wait a minute. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=77.52s)]
*  So are you saying that the people around Biden and Kareen Jean-Pierre and everybody in between, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=78.52s)]
*  this is not real, that they really want Joe to get out of the race and they're all colluding [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=85.2s)]
*  together to push him out by drawing attention to his cognitive decline? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=91.44s)]
*  You believe that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=96.88s)]
*  I do. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=98.04s)]
*  And I think that's the only way they get him to step down. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=99.04s)]
*  That's the only way they convince Jill to convince him to step down is by playing these [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=101.52s)]
*  videos over and over again, making them unavoidable for the American public, because in reality, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=105.44s)]
*  that's exactly what they've done. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  If it is unintentional, it's the biggest self-own this election cycle. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=112.6s)]
*  Mary Catherine, your take. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=117.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure I give them that much credit for the strategy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=119.8s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=124.0s)]
*  Voters have already decided, right, before this latest spate of videos of him mumbling [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  and stumbling. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=130.32s)]
*  And some of this is just undeniable. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=132.12s)]
*  The voters back in February were saying it's 67 percent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=134.48s)]
*  He's too old to serve another term. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  That includes a majority of his own voters. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=139.4s)]
*  In this nonsense from media at large about cheap fakes is just the new Russian disinformation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=142.38s)]
*  It is this flexible term that they can use to say, oh, there's a grave threat to American [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  discourse. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=154.22s)]
*  And the grave threat to American discourse, it turns out, is Americans talking about what's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=155.22s)]
*  happening in front of their eyeballs, and they will try to shut you down. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=159.78s)]
*  I got shut down, one of my posts on Instagram got shut down for posting a poll about what [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=163.26s)]
*  happened at the G7 with Biden that said, is he— [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=167.56s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=170.18s)]
*  Is it missing context, or do you care? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=171.46s)]
*  And I still got shut down. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=173.62s)]
*  I don't think—I can see a scenario where Tommy is a thousand percent right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=176.02s)]
*  The only thing we might disagree on is who the replacement is. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  She's pretty convinced it'll be Gavin Newsom. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  I'm not so sure it would be Gavin. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=186.58s)]
*  I think probably it would be the vice president. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=188.38s)]
*  If not her, it would be Whitmer. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=191.0s)]
*  But I see the positive—look, he's one major fall away from that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  So I guess the question is, do you think that Joe survives, or do you agree with Tommy he [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=197.78s)]
*  doesn't make it? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=204.0s)]
*  Look, I think they're in a pickle, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=205.74s)]
*  Because asking the leader of the free world, who has been running to be the leader of the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=209.22s)]
*  free world since I was eight years old, to step down is a difficult thing to do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=212.9s)]
*  However, I can see a scenario, because those superdelegates have shown several times over [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=217.46s)]
*  in the Democratic Party that they are capable of taking the reins and making the choices [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=222.38s)]
*  for their party instead of voters. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=226.32s)]
*  So there is a possibility that something happens, but I think my money's on Joe continuing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  throughout. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=232.88s)]
*  I think I'm with you, but I can see Tommy's scenario. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=233.88s)]
*  Tommy, walk us through your scenario again. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=237.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=240.0s)]
*  Well, I think it either happens at the convention, and it's a big coup, or it happens directly [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=241.0s)]
*  after the convention. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  Joe has got to be convinced to step down, and I think that the reason that they're playing [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=247.88s)]
*  they're going to continue to play these videos is to embarrass his family that much that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=252.72s)]
*  the power and the allure of the power is not as great as the embarrassment that they're [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=258.6s)]
*  feeling by these videos playing on a loop. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=264.64s)]
*  So I think that's why we're seeing them, and we're going to keep seeing them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=267.2s)]
*  And there's going to be more, because these are not one-offs, Sean. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=269.72s)]
*  There's going to be more between now and probably two weeks from now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=272.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=276.64s)]
*  Last exit question, yes or no. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=277.98s)]
*  Do we see the return of jacked up Joe? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=280.2s)]
*  Mary Catherine. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely yes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  I think that is a very good prediction. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  Every time he has a major event, he is a different person. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=289.28s)]
*  The question is whether the jacked up version can last 90 minutes of coverage and back and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=291.44s)]
*  forth. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=295.44s)]
*  That's tough. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=296.44s)]
*  Tommy, do we see jacked up Joe? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=297.44s)]
*  We see jacked up Joe, but I think it's going to backfire, because it's one thing to be [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=299.68s)]
*  jacked up Joe and deliver a speech. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=303.2s)]
*  It's another when you actually have to answer questions. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=305.2s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=307.84s)]
*  He's not reading a teleprompter, you know, at the speed of light without getting introduced [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=309.76s)]
*  by the Speaker of the House, which is kind of a historic moment. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's my high honor, distinct pleasure to introduce the president. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=317.76s)]
*  Oh, let's just get right to the speech. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  Anyway, pretty funny, but sad also. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=324.12s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CSAdvjirA&t=326.64s)]
