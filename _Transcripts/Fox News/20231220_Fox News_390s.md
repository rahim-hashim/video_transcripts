# Kellyanne Conway: Xi Jinping is walking all over Biden
**Fox News:** [December 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ)
*  Also tonight, while millions of illegal immigrants simply walk across our southern border, China's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=0.0s)]
*  dictator Xi Jinping is walking all over our president, without any fear or reprisal from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=6.4s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=12.52s)]
*  China meddled more than ever in the midterm elections to boot. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=14.4s)]
*  And according to NBC News, President Xi openly threatened Biden at their little summit in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=18.76s)]
*  California, boasting about a plan to attack Taiwan. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=23.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, another hot spot. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=27.88s)]
*  Iran is more emboldened than ever, directing its proxy in Yemen to ramp up attacks on a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  key international shipping route and the U.S. warships in that region. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  Here now with more, Fox News contributor, former Secretary of State and CIA director, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=41.56s)]
*  the only person in American history to have both of those roles, Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=46.4s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  I know the world under Joe Biden. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=54.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, great to be with you this evening. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  I know the world under Joe Biden looks so dangerous to us, and there are so many hot [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  spots around the globe. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  But my fear is that we are clocking in at about one major crisis-slash-war-slash-foreign entanglement [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  on America's doorstep for every year of the Biden presidency. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=71.32s)]
*  2021, the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  2022, Putin invades Ukraine. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=76.88s)]
*  2023, we saw what happened in Israel with Hamas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=79.4s)]
*  And maybe in 2024, China says it's just going to go ahead and, quote, reunify. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=82.64s)]
*  We know what that means, militarily invade Taiwan. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=87.84s)]
*  Can you walk us through what the average American should think about this and know about this? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=92.4s)]
*  Kellyanne, you know, these are not disconnected events. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=98.92s)]
*  I think you grabbed it exactly correctly by describing these as sequential and following [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=103.52s)]
*  on from each other. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=109.68s)]
*  You can even go back one further, which is the story you reported on earlier, which is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=111.56s)]
*  our open southern border. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=114.44s)]
*  The failure of America to stand up for the things that matter, our own sovereignty, our [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=117.12s)]
*  own national interest abroad, those are the things that invite the bad guys, the tyrannical [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  leaders at Xi Jinping, the Ayatollah in Iran, to continue to inflict harm on the United [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=126.4s)]
*  States and our friends and allies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=130.96s)]
*  And when you're in a position where your allies don't trust that you'll defend them and your [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  tell you at a summit that they're going to take another nation by force if that's what's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=137.8s)]
*  necessary and you do nothing, you fail to deter them, you present an enormous amount [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=142.88000000000002s)]
*  of risk to American people, not only here in this country, but any American traveling [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  abroad as well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=152.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=153.52s)]
*  And I think that February 5th, 2021, ended up being such a prophetic day early on in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=154.52s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  One of the very first things he did, Secretary Pompeo, as you know, is he took the Houthis [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  off a very important terror watch list. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  That was what, 16 days into his presidency, this was his big priority as president, the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  $6 billion he forked over to Iran. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=172.76s)]
*  So people are looking at that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=175.16s)]
*  I know that you were very, very fully engaged on the matter of Iran. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=177.32s)]
*  If we had a Republican president again, perhaps President Trump even, what do you think could [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=182.6s)]
*  be done? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=188.06s)]
*  Is the damage too deep and too great? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=189.06s)]
*  Give us a little bit of optimism in what seems like a very pessimistic time as goes [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=191.04s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=195.04s)]
*  The good news, Kellyanne, especially in the Middle East, is we can get this back. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=198.04s)]
*  America has the capacity to do that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=201.64s)]
*  We're a great nation and we have great friends in the region. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=203.28s)]
*  The first thing we would do is make clear, we're not going to tell the Israelis, no, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  you have to fight this war on a limited basis. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=209.84s)]
*  We're going to suggest that you need to be finished somehow eradicating Hamas. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=211.88s)]
*  We would tell the Israelis, do what you need to do to protect your own people, and we would [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  encourage and support them to do that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=220.32s)]
*  We would then secondly go back to our friends, our Gulf Arab state friends, and say, hey, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=222.28s)]
*  look, we're going to be with you on the bad days and the good days. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=225.68s)]
*  And when you do that, you isolate the world's largest state sponsor of terror, the Iranians. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=228.56s)]
*  You got it right. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=233.4s)]
*  This administration tried to make friends with them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=234.56s)]
*  They thought there was such a thing as an Iranian moderate, which is just crazy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=236.2s)]
*  And so they de-designated the terrorists in Yemen that we call the Houthis. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=239.76s)]
*  They emboldened Hezbollah and provided them more weapon systems. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=244.64s)]
*  They did all the things in Iran that threaten the United States and the nation of Israel. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=247.32s)]
*  We can get it back. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=251.56s)]
*  We know how to do it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=252.56s)]
*  You put pressure on Iran. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=253.56s)]
*  You make friends in the region. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=254.56s)]
*  And you can keep our young boys and girls from having to ever go risk their lives and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=255.56s)]
*  fight and die in that place, like so many have for so many years. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=258.76s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo, when it comes to the Middle East and what's happening in Israel, you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=263.72s)]
*  had the role of secretary of state. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=268.08s)]
*  What advice would you give to Anthony Blinken right now? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's difficult because he is following the leadership of what was President Obama [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=273.32s)]
*  now President Biden, who have just a fundamental different view of the Middle East. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=279.32s)]
*  They're skeptical when it comes to Israel. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=283.2s)]
*  They called the crown prince of Saudi Arabia a pariah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  He allowed Afghanistan to go away and get 13 Americans killed. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  Those are tough things for a secretary of state. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=295.55999999999995s)]
*  We don't have a leader who's prepared to do the right thing to deter these adversaries. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=297.28s)]
*  So I would encourage him to give President Biden the backbone that is required to keep [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=301.11999999999995s)]
*  America safe. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=305.61999999999995s)]
*  It's absolutely possible for America to get this back, Kellyanne. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=306.66s)]
*  And since you know everything in every region, Secretary Pompeo, I have to ask you about [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=309.86s)]
*  something else in our remaining moments that was in the news today, the prisoner swap happening [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=313.08s)]
*  in Venezuela. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=316.82s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=317.82s)]
*  So we worked hard in the Trump administration to get this fellow taken off the streets, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=321.24s)]
*  this guy, Saab. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  We chased him all around. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=326.7s)]
*  We got him here. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=327.7s)]
*  He was supporting Maduro, the regime there who's got a $15 million warrant to get him [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=328.78000000000003s)]
*  back to the United States of America. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  That's the leader of Venezuela. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=336.14s)]
*  I don't think this trade made any sense for the United States of America. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=337.62s)]
*  When you kowtow, when you bend a knee to these authoritarian regimes, I'm glad we're getting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=341.5s)]
*  some people back home, but there'll be more Americans taken hostage. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=347.18s)]
*  There'll be more Americans wrongfully detained. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=350.74s)]
*  You can't appease these folks, Kellyanne. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  You saw this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  You know it firsthand. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=355.97999999999996s)]
*  You have to demonstrate American power. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=357.24s)]
*  When you do that, you can keep Americans safe, and you don't have to make these terrible [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=359.08s)]
*  the Biden administration has made now repeatedly. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=363.54s)]
*  Secretary Mike Pompeo, thank you very much for sharing your insights tonight and certainly [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=366.5s)]
*  for being an amazing patron and a great public servant. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=371.58000000000004s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=374.42s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=375.42s)]
*  Bless you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=376.42s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHSErAI2eQ&t=377.42s)]
