# Hulk Hogan: I stayed silent for so long and it was killing me
**Fox News:** [July 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ)
*  All right, last night legendary pro wrestler Hogan captivated America with a very entertaining [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=0.0s)]
*  speech at the RNC, including this scene of him ripping his shirt off. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=7.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=12.68s)]
*  But what happened last week when they took a shot at my hero and they tried to kill the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=13.68s)]
*  the next president of the United States? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=26.2s)]
*  Enough was enough. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=27.2s)]
*  And I said, let Trump-a-mania run wild, brother. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=28.2s)]
*  Let Trump-a-mania rule again. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=29.2s)]
*  Let Trump-a-mania make America great again. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=30.2s)]

*  Eric Sch construction at mejorra easier, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=37.2s)]
*  I don't know how much of that was were prepared remarks versus you just being you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=65.2s)]
*  What was it? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=70.84s)]
*  Well, brother, you know, it was electric there last night and my partner that was with me, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=71.84s)]
*  he said the stage manager commented to him, he hasn't gone to the teleprompter for six [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=77.2s)]
*  minutes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=83.12s)]
*  I'm surprised they haven't jerked him off the stage yet. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=84.12s)]
*  So brother, I was I was winging and flying and pivoting and and just doing audibles. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=86.74000000000001s)]
*  And I was listening to the crowd and feeling them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=92.4s)]
*  It kind of was like being in the wrestling ring. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=94.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=98.12s)]
*  You know, you said something that really caught my attention. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=99.12s)]
*  You said as an entertainer, you try to stay out of politics. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  You went on to say, but after everything that's happened to our country over the past four [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=105.56s)]
*  years, everything that happened last weekend, I can no longer stay silent. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  Explain. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, brother, as an entertainer, you want to sell tickets and you really don't want [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  to split your audience. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=123.12s)]
*  You know, you don't want to say I'm a Democrat or I'm a Republican. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=124.2s)]
*  You want all kind of people come to see you perform. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  I stayed silent for so long. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=130.6s)]
*  It was killing me. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=132.96s)]
*  I watched the border crash and burn. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=134.44s)]
*  I watched the economy crash and burn. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=137.28s)]
*  I watched Trump's family be compromised. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=139.6s)]
*  I watched his business. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  I watched him try to put him in jail. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  I was silent and I hardly could hold my tongue. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=146.4s)]
*  And then when they took that shot at him and tried to kill our leader, that was it [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=149.88s)]
*  for me, brother. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  I couldn't do it anymore. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  But that's why I stayed silent, because it was a business decision. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  It was a weak decision. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=161.12s)]
*  It was a cowardly decision. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=162.12s)]
*  But now that's over with, brother. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm on the team. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=166.4s)]
*  You know, it's amazing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=168.48s)]
*  You talk about things and, you know, I'm sure over the years you've done really well financially. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=169.8s)]
*  I started out with no money in my adult life. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=176.4s)]
*  I would assume you probably did as well. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=179.76s)]
*  And I remember those days. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=182.32s)]
*  It's kind of burned into my brain. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  I still have the same thought process in some ways. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=185.72s)]
*  And you think of, you know, 25 percent of Americans forgoing meals. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=189.88s)]
*  You think of, you know, two-thirds of the country saying they're gasping for air, trying [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=193.92s)]
*  to make ends meet. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  You look at 11 million unvetted illegals at our border. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=200.92s)]
*  You look at the insanity of no bail, defund, dismantle, reimagine the police. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=204.82s)]
*  You look at America's standing in the world. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=210.5s)]
*  You look at the high price of energy for everybody. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it just downright pisses me off, because everything that I mentioned, including the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=215.18s)]
*  assassination attempt, all of this was preventable. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=220.78s)]
*  And when preventable things happen, it drives me up a wall. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=225.74s)]
*  Well, I feel the same way. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=231.98s)]
*  I mean, with the money, when we do not put America first, like has been happening for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=234.17999999999998s)]
*  years and years and years, if we had that type of money, every American should be a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=239.38s)]
*  millionaire. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=244.1s)]
*  With the billions and billions of dollars they've given away, it just kills me to see [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=245.1s)]
*  our vets on the street, to see the vets not being taken care of. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=248.7s)]
*  I've been with the WWE, bro, since 1977. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=252.14s)]
*  And one of the things we do is we visit the hospitals. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  We do the USO tours. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=258.06s)]
*  We go all over the place. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=259.62s)]
*  These vets put their lives on the line for us so we can be free. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=261.62s)]
*  And we don't take care of them. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=265.22s)]
*  Donald Trump is putting his life on the line to try to make America great again. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=266.86s)]
*  And someone like me is going to remain silent. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=272.42s)]
*  It doesn't happen, brother. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  It can't go this way. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  I want all the people that were in the same position I was, the ones that were afraid [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=277.74s)]
*  to put a Trump sign in their yard, the ones who were afraid to wear a Trump shirt or a [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=282.1s)]
*  Trump hat, to not be silent anymore. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=286.5s)]
*  We need to save this country, not for ourselves but for our children and our children's children, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=289.14s)]
*  for generations to come. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=293.82s)]
*  This country needs to be saved. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=295.38s)]
*  He doesn't need to do this either. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  And I've asked him many times, why do you do it? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=301.41999999999996s)]
*  Because we've got to save our country. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=303.78s)]
*  I mean, to him, it's not even a thought process. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  It's instinctive almost at this point. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=308.82s)]
*  And when he says he'll get it done very quickly, I believe he will. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, the thing that kills me is I know this man. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=316.02s)]
*  I mean, this man has been good to me, been good to my family, and I watch how he treats [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=319.46s)]
*  people over the years. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=324.34s)]
*  I've known him for 35 years. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=325.34s)]
*  And what the press does, they make him like he's the devil or something. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=327.26s)]
*  They write the worst stuff in the world. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  And it's not true. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=332.78s)]
*  This is a great man. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=334.29999999999995s)]
*  This is a great American. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=335.97999999999996s)]
*  OK, he's got a personality. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  A lot of us do. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=339.14s)]
*  OK, he's got a little bit of an ego or a lot of an ego. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=340.14s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=343.7s)]
*  He loves America. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=344.82s)]
*  He loves people. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=345.82s)]
*  He loves to see people do good. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=347.3s)]
*  And that's what he's all about. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=349.18s)]
*  And the sooner people get this, the sooner better off they will be. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=350.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, they try to create a caricature and dehumanize him. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=356.74s)]
*  And they're willing to do anything to stop him. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  By the way, one thing that would stop me from ever getting in the ring is you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=365.18s)]
*  I think I'll pass on that opportunity if I'm ever given it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=368.98s)]
*  I've watched you in the ring, man, for a long time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=372.1s)]
*  And you're a killer out there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=375.02000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=378.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, I've got remarried. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  I've got a stepson that I just got even jujitsu because of you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3VorYp3EQ&t=380.02000000000004s)]
