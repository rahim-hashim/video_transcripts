# Vivek: This is the #1 thing we must reject
**Fox News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4)
*  In 2023, Vivek Ramaswamy took to the political scene, but it took a by storm when he announced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=0.0s)]
*  his campaign for president. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=8.08s)]
*  Now, Ramaswamy gearing up to get back on the campaign trail. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=9.68s)]
*  He is expected to announce a run for Ohio governor in 2026. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=12.8s)]
*  Now, some of Vice President Vance's top political advisers have already joined Ramaswamy's team. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=17.16s)]
*  And despite not formally announcing his campaign yet, new polling, look at this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=24.0s)]
*  They found the Ohio native with an impressive lead over potential competitors, winning 52% [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=28.6s)]
*  of GOP voters in a hypothetical primary ballot. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  And his closest opponent had 18. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  Here with more. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=41.6s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=42.6s)]
*  OK, obvious question. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=43.6s)]
*  You can't look at that number. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  You're at 52. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Your closest competitor, if you want to even call it a competitor, is at 18. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=48.92s)]
*  The next person's at 2. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  So I would say that your odds of being the next governor are high if you want it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=55.74s)]
*  Do you want it? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=60.38s)]
*  Look, I think that states are going to have to lead the way. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=61.38s)]
*  It reminds me of Donald Trump-sized leads in the primaries, which encourages me, Sean. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=65.3s)]
*  But the way I look at this is that Donald Trump is leading the way at the federal government. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=69.58s)]
*  He's doing his job to get the federal government out of the way in areas like education. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=72.86s)]
*  But after that, it's going to fall on the states to have to lead the way. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=77.48s)]
*  And one of the issues, you know I've been very focused on this, is driving the educational [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=80.98s)]
*  achievement crisis in the right direction in this country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=84.94s)]
*  Seventy-five percent of eighth graders can't do proficient math. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=88.34s)]
*  Seventy percent of them aren't proficient in reading. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=91.42s)]
*  It's going to have to be the states that lead the way here, Sean. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=94.06s)]
*  And one of the things I'm most interested in is actually driving achievement so our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=96.58s)]
*  kids are prepared to actually compete, not as victims, but as victors in a competitive [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=100.42s)]
*  global economy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=105.74s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to doing at the state level what President Trump is leading at the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=107.06s)]
*  federal level. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=110.18s)]
*  One of the biggest failuresâ€”I'll stay on this topic of education. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=112.02s)]
*  I think if you look at states that have been run for decades by Democrats, like New York, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=115.22s)]
*  for example, New York City, deep blue state, they spend nearly 40 grand per capita per [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=121.34s)]
*  student and they come in and reading and math, you know, anywhere between 36th and 40th in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=126.74s)]
*  terms of industrialized country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=133.38s)]
*  How do you fail at that spectacular level? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=135.94s)]
*  Because we're failing our children and all the talent God put in every one of them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=138.26s)]
*  It's because we've abandoned meritocracy and the culture of achievement in favor of this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=144.54s)]
*  culture of victimhood in our country, Sean. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  And I think that's the number one thing we're going to have to reject to save our country, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=151.14s)]
*  is that culture of victimhood. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  How do we restore merit? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=157.22s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=158.22s)]
*  First is, of course, universal school choice. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  And conservatives like you and I have been pushing for this for a long time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=161.44s)]
*  States like Texas are doing great. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=165.06s)]
*  I think states like Ohio have done well, but can go further. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=166.62s)]
*  But here's a step that we haven't taken yet that we need to, which is also improving our [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=169.5s)]
*  public schools through merit-based pay for teachers and for administrators. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=173.34s)]
*  If students are doing a great job, those teachers and those administrators deserve to be paid [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=178.94s)]
*  more than they are now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=183.12s)]
*  But those who are failing our kids shouldn't be able to just sit there and keep collecting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=184.6s)]
*  their paychecks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=188.0s)]
*  That's what we need is to light a fire under the feet of that system. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  You got deep sea coming this way from China. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=192.66s)]
*  You got students in China and other countries, in many cases, lapping our own students right [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=194.9s)]
*  here at home in areas like science and math. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  And in some cases, even in English proficiency, that's just unacceptable to me. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  But we're not going to sit around and just talk about it anymore. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=206.3s)]
*  Sean, President Trump's doing a great job. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=208.62s)]
*  Shut down the Department of Education and give that money back to the states. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  But after that, it's going to take creative governors who are going to have creative solutions, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=214.54000000000002s)]
*  not just copying yesterday's models, but implementing merit-based pay, actually taking on universal [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=218.3s)]
*  school choice to the next level, including homeschooling freedom. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=223.54s)]
*  That's how we're going to set our kids free. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=227.02s)]
*  Let's talk about Doge. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=229.38s)]
*  You had partnered with Elon Musk. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=230.6s)]
*  What is the status of your position there? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=233.54s)]
*  Has there been any controversy, any conflict? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=237.22s)]
*  Actually, we were on a Spaces last night that started at midnight. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=240.74s)]
*  Elon and I co-hosted it last night. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=245.3s)]
*  It went till about 1.30 a.m., which shows what the around-the-clock work schedule looks [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=246.88s)]
*  like. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=251.06s)]
*  I played the role that I did in helping get that off the ground. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=252.9s)]
*  And the conclusion that we all came to is that with my focus on constitutional law, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=254.66s)]
*  on driving change through legislation, elected office was the right place from which to do [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=258.82s)]
*  it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=263.5s)]
*  But here's the other thing, Sean, is in order for the thinning out of the federal government [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=264.5s)]
*  to be successful, when in doubt, my advice is cut it at the federal level. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=267.26s)]
*  And if it's a doubtful area, send it back to the states. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=272.18s)]
*  Thinking about work requirements for Medicaid and welfare that aren't being applied, that's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=275.26s)]
*  an issue for the states. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=278.94s)]
*  Thinking about those educational failures, that's an issue for the states. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  Much of the overburdened federal regulation is duplicative of additional regulations at [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=283.5s)]
*  the state level as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=288.26s)]
*  So saving this country, I think it is going to be a team effort. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is doing his part at the best from the very top. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  But if we're going to save the country, it's going to be bottom-up as well. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=295.62s)]
*  That's why I'm drawn to my next chapter, and I'll have more to say about that pretty soon. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  Eliminate the Department of Education. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=303.38s)]
*  You cut every mom and dad a check. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  What school will they pick? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=306.5s)]
*  The one that actually educates their kids. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=307.5s)]
*  We'll watch this race closely. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=310.38s)]
*  Amen. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=311.7s)]
*  You're vague, Ramaswami. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=312.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkFJPZItJ4&t=312.7s)]
