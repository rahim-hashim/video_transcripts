# Biden's border speech likely be very ‘political’: Peter Doocy
**Fox News:** [February 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o)
*  But first, here with a lot more is Fox News White House correspondent Peter Ducey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=0.0s)]
*  Peter, you know, please fact check me. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=4.68s)]
*  For three long years, haven't we been told over and over again by the president, the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=6.84s)]
*  vice president, Department of Homeland Security secretary, and every spokesperson they've [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  ever had that the border's closed, the border's secure? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=16.96s)]
*  Didn't we hear that for three years, and now all of a sudden it's Republicans' fault, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=20.36s)]
*  and that it's a mess now and they won't help him? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=24.62s)]
*  We did hear that over and over, and a lot's changed in the 14 or 15 months since I asked [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=29.72s)]
*  President Biden before he flew out to Arizona one day why he was going to a border state [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=35.58s)]
*  and not visiting the border, and he told me it was because there were more important things [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  going on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=44.4s)]
*  Now, recently, you talk to people at the White House, you talk to people at the Biden campaign, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=45.4s)]
*  they would list the number one issue in this election that is coming up as being the cost [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=49.4s)]
*  of living or the economy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=54.72s)]
*  But this trip seems to be an admission that they have realized they cannot win reelection [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=56.32s)]
*  without fixing what is happening at the border. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=62.88s)]
*  And there is a lot of talk among Democrats about how this is not a political issue. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=66.6s)]
*  They got to get the politics out of it to fix it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=72.76s)]
*  But what we're going to see on Thursday, at least probably from Trump and from Biden, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=74.84s)]
*  but what we're going to see from President Biden is going to be very political. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=79.84s)]
*  He is going to be talking about how it is on Republicans to get a little bit of urgency [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=83.52s)]
*  behind them and pass this bipartisan Senate deal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=88.72s)]
*  But I was talking to some Republican governors coming out of their meeting with the president [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=93.64s)]
*  at the White House on Friday, and they said they didn't really see a point in President [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=97.88s)]
*  Biden continuing to focus on that bipartisan Senate deal, because, yes, Republicans helped [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=102.96s)]
*  negotiate it, but it's dead right now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump put enough pressure on Republicans to kill the bill, essentially. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  He didn't like it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  He got enough people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  He's the leader of the party, got enough people with him. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  That package is dead. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  So what lawmakers want to see are other things that President Biden can do. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  And we know, possibly before the State of the Union next week, he is considering some [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=127.94000000000001s)]
*  executive actions like restricting who can ask for asylum and where at the border. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=132.32s)]
*  The place that he's going to go, according to our teams down there, is a sector, the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  Rio Grande Sector. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=146.44s)]
*  It's where things are pretty dead this time of year, dead like only 300 or 400 encounters [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=147.68s)]
*  a day. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=153.0s)]
*  It's other places at the border where they're getting 2,000, 4,000. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=154.0s)]
*  The Border Patrol cannot keep up with the volume of people coming across. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Something else that was kind of funny tonight, to see President Biden at the ice cream shop [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=165.24s)]
*  in New York, where he was fundraising and taping a late-night comedy show, he said that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=169.76s)]
*  he was always going to go to the border. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=174.44s)]
*  He didn't know that his good friend Donald Trump was going to just happen to be there [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=177.6s)]
*  the same day. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=181.68s)]
*  Sean? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=182.68s)]
*  Just, I had no idea at all. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=183.68s)]
*  So like East Palestine, a year after the train derailment, oh, a year later he comes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=185.28s)]
*  He's three years late, and it's three years of documented lies about how the border was [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=190.32s)]
*  closed and secure in spite of what our eyes were showing us, and we were showing this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=196.44000000000003s)]
*  audience and the American people saw for themselves. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=200.56s)]
*  Pretty unbelievable. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, I guess we'll be seeing you down in Texas on Thursday. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  Peter Ducey, thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-sApKte2o&t=208.68s)]
