# Hannity: This will be problematic for Biden
**Fox News:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  We are exactly 24 hours away from the CNN presidential debate between Donald Trump and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=4.48s)]
*  Joe Biden, which will be simulcast right here on the Fox News Channel tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=9.64s)]
*  Throughout the show, we will cover the topics that should be discussed in any presidential [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=13.6s)]
*  debate, like, let's see, the 400 illegal, unvetted Joe Biden immigrants smuggled across [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=17.76s)]
*  Joe Biden's wide open southern border by an ISIS link group. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=24.68s)]
*  According to a new bombshell report, the Biden administration has completely lost track of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=29.92s)]
*  dozens of these potential terrorists now inside our country. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=34.88s)]
*  I've been warning you, praying I'm wrong, but I told you I'd be right. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  A full report is straight ahead tonight. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  Also tonight, we will focus on Biden inflation, which is not transitory as prices continue [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=45.32s)]
*  to rise every month, month after month. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=51.2s)]
*  John Solomon also here tonight with breaking news, a new report on the so-called Biden [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=54.04s)]
*  brand. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=58.92s)]
*  And will fake Jake Tapper or fake Dana Bash ask Biden about his ties to his son's shady [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=59.92s)]
*  international business partners or the fact that Joe Biden lied about the issue? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=66.56s)]
*  I never spoke to my son or brother or anybody. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=71.52s)]
*  Or Joe's lies that in the last debate he had with Donald Trump about Hunter's very [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=74.48s)]
*  real laptop. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=79.32s)]
*  Will they ask him why he lied about these things over and over and over again? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Will any of these important topics, you know, come up that we just mentioned in this presidential [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=87.52s)]
*  debate or will fake news CNN focus on abortion climate change, January 6th, the 2020 election [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=92.2s)]
*  and democracy in peril, their other favorite topic, because I have some bad news for the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=100.92s)]
*  Biden Democrats at fake news CNN. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=106.64s)]
*  Well, we have a new poll from The Washington Post, and it is out and it found that swing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  state deciders trust Donald Trump more than Biden to protect democracy, not Joe Biden. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  And as it turns out, trying to jail your chief political rival in the middle of an election [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  while censoring his speech with a gag order, while also trying to force him off the ballot [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  in several states. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=130.44s)]
*  Well, it's kind of frowned upon by Americans who actually happen to be fair minded and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  care about democracy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=136.28s)]
*  Now, on top of that, that's not the only bad poll for Joe Biden and his supporters [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=138.04s)]
*  at fake news CNN. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  A brand new Quinnipiac University survey. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=144.56s)]
*  It now has Donald Trump up by four nationwide in a head-to-head matchup with Biden in previous [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=147.64s)]
*  results, by the way, from this Quinnipiac poll. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  It had Biden tied or in the lead all year. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  Now Trump up by four. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=161.0s)]
*  And get this, Donald Trump is up by six if you include third party candidates. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=162.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, Nate Silver, who is a well-known left-leaning statistician, loved by the liberal [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=166.92s)]
*  leftist radical mob crowd. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, he launched his first presidential election forecast of 2024. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=175.56s)]
*  According to Nate Silver, quote, the presidential election is not a toss up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=180.4s)]
*  He continues as our model launches either Biden or Trump could easily win, but the odds [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=185.12s)]
*  are well heavily in Trump's favor. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=190.72s)]
*  As of right now, Silver is predicting that Trump has more than a 65% chance of winning [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=193.48s)]
*  in November. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=198.4s)]
*  By the way, don't take any of these polls to heart. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=199.4s)]
*  Act as though you're six points behind, you have no timeouts, you have a two-minute [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=202.72s)]
*  drill going, you're on your own 20, you got to drive down the field 80 yards, cross [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=208.48s)]
*  the plane, kick the extra point if you want to win. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=213.52s)]
*  Play like you're behind. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=216.6s)]
*  Needless to say, Biden needs a boost from tomorrow's CNN presidential debate, needs [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=217.96s)]
*  it badly, badly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=222.28s)]
*  Luckily for Joe, while two of his biggest supporters are moderating with topics and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=223.96s)]
*  graphics produced by CNN's far-left staff, as a vague Ramoswami put it, it will be stacked [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  against Donald Trump likely the whole time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=234.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=237.12s)]
*  I'm looking forward to hopefully what is a policy-rich debate that actually informs [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=238.12s)]
*  Americans of facts they need. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=242.48s)]
*  I'll also tell you something I told President Trump, and I'll tell you as well, is I give [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=244.88s)]
*  him a lot of credit for doing this debate on the terms that were effectively set by [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=247.36s)]
*  Biden, hosted by CNN in Atlanta without a live audience, would be the equivalent of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=252.55999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden agreeing to do a Fox News hosted debate in Alabama with 3,000 live audience [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  members. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=262.56s)]
*  So I give Donald Trump a lot of credit for that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=263.56s)]
*  If you're going to lead the country, you got to be able to show up, and that's exactly [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=265.28s)]
*  what he's doing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=268.32s)]
*  Well said. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=270.28s)]
*  So what are the odds that fake news CNN will be pro-Biden and biased? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=271.28s)]
*  Well, we actually have a poll. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=274.88s)]
*  It's on Hannity.com or Sean Hannity on X. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=276.92s)]
*  If you want to go, it's at Sean Hannity on X or Hannity.com, and we'll give you results [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  at the end of the show tonight. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=285.8s)]
*  As of now, by the way, we put it up during my radio show, over 90 percent so far of those [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=287.04s)]
*  voting believe there's 100 percent chance that fake news CNN will favor Joe Biden. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=291.92s)]
*  Well, the thought of it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=297.04s)]
*  I sincerely hope, and I mean this, for the sake of the country, that I'm wrong. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=298.48s)]
*  And somehow, someway, fake Jake, fake Dana, conduct a fair and balanced debate. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=303.4s)]
*  The odds, I would argue, are low. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=308.96s)]
*  Between the format of tomorrow's contest, the pro-Biden moderators, the liberal producers [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=311.23999999999995s)]
*  of fake news CNN, Biden, they've done everything they can do to set him up for success, nevermind [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=315.79999999999995s)]
*  probably cases of Red Bull. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=321.28s)]
*  But will he also get another boost in the form of that caffeinated pill or that Red [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=323.52s)]
*  Bull or something stronger? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=327.44s)]
*  Because Biden refusing, is refusing to take a drug test. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=330.2s)]
*  But if he comes out to the debate stage hyper caffeinated or jacked up Joe like the State [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=333.84s)]
*  of the Union, where he screamed and yelled the entire speech in record time, it'll be [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=339.08s)]
*  obvious to the American people watching. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=344.12s)]
*  That will also be problematic for Joe. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, with the exception of his insane State of the Union speech, Joe Biden has been practically [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  comatose for months. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=354.28s)]
*  He stares off into space. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=356.08s)]
*  We've played the videos over and over. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  He forgets where to stand. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=359.76s)]
*  He freezes up, struggles with names, struggles with dates. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=361.0s)]
*  Basic tasks are often difficult for Joe. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=364.56s)]
*  So if he debates with energy and vigor that we usually don't see, just know that's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=367.64s)]
*  not usual Joe. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, the president's day-to-day is pretty pathetic at this point. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=374.2s)]
*  He wakes up late, goes to bed early. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=377.6s)]
*  Most days he participates in no more than one public event. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  But while Joe Biden sleeps, his radical staff is trying to transform our country into something [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=383.24s)]
*  pretty scary. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  Open borders, out-of-control spending, $4 trillion in new debt the last two years alone. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=389.64s)]
*  New tax proposals, 44% capital gains tax. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  That will add to, like, an American depression or create one. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=398.8s)]
*  And every month, a war on American energy and a special dedication, of course, to woke [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=402.64s)]
*  politics. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=407.2s)]
*  Now, for example, this is Rachel Levine, Joe Biden's secretary for health. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=408.4s)]
*  Now, Rachel Levine allegedly wanted to make it easier for children—not for adults, for [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  children—to receive life-altering transgender procedures, including mastectomies and genital [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=419.52s)]
*  surgeries. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=426.56s)]
*  So, according to a report, Rachel Levine successfully pressured medical experts to Nick's age limits [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=427.56s)]
*  in their guidelines for these extreme, irreversible procedures, making them more accessible to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnonq27-I0&t=434.64s)]
