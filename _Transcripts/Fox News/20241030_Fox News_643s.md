# Hannity: According to Dems, millions of Americans are racist, sexist, fascist-loving Nazis
**Fox News:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss)
*  The party of unity, the party of joy and happiness and love and peace is at it again, according to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=0.0s)]
*  the president of the United States, Joe Biden, half the country is, quote, garbage. Take a look. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=6.08s)]
*  Well, let me tell you something. I don't, I don't know the Puerto Rican that I know, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=12.88s)]
*  or Puerto Rico where I'm in my home state of Delaware. They're good, decent, honorable people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=24.0s)]
*  Oh, of course you support Donald Trump. According to the Democratic party, millions of Americans, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  just like you and me, we are a basket of irredeemable deplorables. We are racist, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=34.24s)]
*  sexist, fascist, loving Nazis who cling to our God, our guns, our Bibles, our religion. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=39.76s)]
*  And now apparently the top Democrat in the White House thinks that we're also garbage. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=45.44s)]
*  But as the saying goes, one man's trash is another man's treasure. And today in Wisconsin, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  take a look at that. This may go down as an iconic, epic moment that we will remember for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=56.32s)]
*  a long time. Donald Trump hitching a very special ride on a garbage truck decked out in American [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=63.52s)]
*  flags, MAGA gear. You can tell a lot about the state of a campaign by optics. As the Democrats [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=69.12s)]
*  ratchet up the hatred, the name calling, the vitriol, Donald Trump, he's working at McDonald's. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  He's telling jokes at the Al Smith dinner. He is comforting people in North Carolina when it matters [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=80.32s)]
*  and working with Elon Musk to get them communications. Generally, in this case, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=85.52s)]
*  tonight, having a great time. Take a look. I think the Democrats have done a very poor job. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=90.56s)]
*  We're leading in every, in every state. We're leading big. And I think that the comment made [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=96.0s)]
*  by really both of them, because there's really two of them, about being garbage, maybe 250 million [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=102.16s)]
*  people, they shouldn't be talking. That's like deplorable for Hillary. This is the deplorable [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=108.16s)]
*  for Hillary. And I think this is worse, actually. For Joe Biden to make that statement, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=113.36s)]
*  it's really a disgrace. I have to begin by saying 250 million Americans are not garbage. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=119.12s)]
*  My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple. You can't lead America if you don't love Americans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=129.04s)]
*  The problem with the Democratic Party, they are now the party of coastal elites. They are the party [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=137.68s)]
*  that caters to Hollywood, D.C., and New York society. Donald Trump knows that without hard [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=143.04s)]
*  working Americans, the people that really do make this country great, the people that collect our [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=149.76s)]
*  trash, pave our roads, drill for oil, do the fracking, grow our crops, deliver food to stores [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=155.04s)]
*  and trucks, make our food, build our infrastructure, America would come to a grinding halt. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=161.68s)]
*  You're not going to see Kamala in the back of a garbage truck. Now, she prefers the manicured [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=168.08s)]
*  grounds of the Washington ellipse, where last night, surrounded by her elitist D.C. friends, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=173.36s)]
*  she viciously trashed Donald Trump and then, almost in the same breath, started talking about unity. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  This lack of self-awareness in the Democratic Party is almost unbelievable. Take a look. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=185.44s)]
*  For too long, we have been consumed with too much division, chaos, and mutual distrust. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=192.08s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=203.04s)]
*  Donald Trump's got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=208.0s)]
*  There's a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  and don't think that he doesn't know for one second exactly what they're doing there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=218.0s)]
*  I will work every day to build consensus and reach compromise. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=222.8s)]
*  I know this sounds bizarre. It sounds like if I said this five years ago, you'd lock me up. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=228.8s)]
*  We got to lock him up. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=235.04s)]
*  It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=236.08s)]
*  Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I do. Yes, I do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=250.8s)]
*  My humble advice to Democrats, well, you might have a hard time unifying the country [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  while campaigning and comparing your political opponents to Nazis and fascists and racists, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=258.56s)]
*  and referring to half the country as garbage. It is past time for Democrats to pick a lane. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=264.48s)]
*  You want to bring the country together, or do you want to call the people in this country that you [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=269.76s)]
*  disagree with evil? Because you can't have it both ways. You can't do both. Naturally, the state-run [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  media mob, they are trying their level best to help put a positive spin on all of the lying, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=280.24s)]
*  the smearing, the hypocrisy. And today, The Washington Post pushed the White House propaganda [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=286.56s)]
*  with claims that Biden's garbage comments were little more than a punctuation error. Meanwhile, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=292.16s)]
*  NPR accusing Republicans of pouncing on Biden's rhetoric and someone on fake news CNN blaming [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  Biden's stutter. The excuses have been coming in hot. They've been coming in fast. As always, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=303.44s)]
*  we let you decide. Just to clarify, he was not calling Trump supporters garbage, which is why [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=308.56s)]
*  he put out—this is why he wanted to make sure that we put out a statement that clarified what [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  he meant and what he was trying to say. So I don't understand why you clutching your pearls, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=321.84s)]
*  because you're trying to make something out of a tongue slip. As someone who had a stutter growing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=326.96s)]
*  up, it's very obvious to me that there's an apostrophe at the end of supporters there. He [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=332.64s)]
*  was referring to the garbage spewed by supporters, not simply the supporters themselves. I don't [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=336.32s)]
*  understand why he's walking that back, because I mean, based off the examples he gave, like, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=341.12s)]
*  if you are a person who supports those examples that he gave, you are garbage. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=345.84s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, when asked about Biden's rhetoric, Kamala Harris just couldn't find the courage to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  condemn her boss, and instead she served up another meaningless word salad, as per usual. Take a look. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=358.0s)]
*  REPORTER 2 [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=364.56s)]
*  Have you spoken to President Biden since his comment last night about garbage? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  REPORTER 1 [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=368.88s)]
*  Listen, I think that, first of all, he clarified his comments. But let me be clear, I strongly [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=378.0s)]
*  REPORTER 2 [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=384.56s)]
*  She's just talking in circles, just like she wouldn't condemn her own vice president [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=386.24s)]
*  who compared the MSG rally to a Nazi rally, just like she calls Donald Trump a fascist. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=390.48s)]
*  And keep in mind the environment, after two would-be assassins and Iranian assassination teams in this [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=396.24s)]
*  country, you would think they might want to ratchet down the rhetoric and be responsible, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=402.24s)]
*  but no, they're irresponsible. Now, she and her surrogates, they are spending the last stretch of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=406.72s)]
*  this campaign with smears and slander and lies and propaganda and misinformation every single day, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  not only of Donald Trump, but everyone that supports Donald Trump. They are claiming that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=418.16s)]
*  you are Nazis, fascist supporters. For example, her running mate, weird Tim Walz, is still [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=422.88000000000005s)]
*  unapologetic, comparing Americans to Nazis, because that's what he was claiming. Take a look. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=428.72s)]
*  REPORTER 1 [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=434.32000000000005s)]
*  You were comparing that rally to a Nazi rally? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=435.28s)]
*  REPORTER 2 Look, I'm comparing it to the hate that came out of this, and I think they confirmed that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=437.28s)]
*  REPORTER 1 You stand by that comparison, though, to a Nazi rally? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=440.4s)]
*  REPORTER 2 Look, the rally, you saw it for yourself. I'll let the American public make the decision of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=442.64s)]
*  what they saw. REPORTER 1 What about you, though? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  REPORTER 2 So I know what I saw, and I'll just leave it at that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=447.44s)]
*  REPORTER 3 How is she going to find common ground with people who supported Donald Trump, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  someone she calls a wannabe dictator and a petty tyrant? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  REPORTER 4 Well, good morning, George. Yeah, the vice president's rhetoric is the rhetoric that a [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=456.08s)]
*  president of the United States gives, one that understands we're all in this together. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=460.64s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to the president's comments, but I want to put it into a larger [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  context of your recent comment comparing the Sunday Trump rally to a Nazi rally. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=468.0s)]
*  And I would also throw in there Obama's bitter, clingers, guns and religion comment from a while [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  back, the deplorable line from Hillary Clinton's campaign, and the way that Democrats are seen by [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=477.76s)]
*  some voters as disrespecting them. And I have to ask, does that undercut this closing message of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  unity from your campaign? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  REPORTER 2 No, certainly not. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  REPORTER 1 No, not at all. Are you kidding? Come on. Once again, just weeks after two different [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=493.52s)]
*  people tried to assassinate Donald Trump, killing one of his supporters, Kamala just doesn't have [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=500.32s)]
*  the courage to simply do the right thing, lower the temperature. Take a look. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=505.44s)]
*  REPORTER 2 I talked with Governor Walz yesterday. He compared Trump's rally on Sunday to that of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=509.68s)]
*  one of the Nazi rallies in the Ferris at Madison Square Garden. Do you compare that? Do you find [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=516.0s)]
*  a similar comparison? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=520.96s)]
*  REPORTER 2 Listen, this election is in seven days, and I think the American people have a very [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=522.0s)]
*  clear choice. And on the one hand, you have Donald Trump, who is constantly fanning the flames of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=527.28s)]
*  division and hate, who is trying to have the American people point their fingers at each other, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=534.16s)]
*  or my leadership, which is founded on a lived and an experience that the vast majority of us [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lE5mFzjss&t=540.56s)]
