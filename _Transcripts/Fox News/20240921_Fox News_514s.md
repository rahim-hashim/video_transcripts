# John Kennedy: Whoever crafted Kamala Harris' economic plan wouldn’t be in charge of a ham sandwich
**Fox News:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA)
*  All right, during her softball interview with Oprah last night, Kamala, well, she gave us [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=0.0s)]
*  a whole lot of nothing when asked how she would lower the cost of living. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=7.04s)]
*  Now, that's the question on every American's mind. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=10.92s)]
*  And Kamala delivered one of her classic word salads. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=14.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  We really would love to know what your plan is to help lower the cost of living. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=24.28s)]
*  First of all, thank you both for being here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=25.84s)]
*  And yours is a story I hear around the country as I travel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=28.520000000000003s)]
*  And in terms of both rightly having the right to have aspirations and dreams and ambitions [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=34.36s)]
*  for your family and working hard and finding that the American dream is, for this generation [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=45.32s)]
*  and so many recently, far more elusive than it's been. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=54.24s)]
*  And we need to deal with that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=58.96s)]
*  That answer the question? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=62.56s)]
*  Because the average American is paying somewhere around 28,000 grand more per family since [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=63.56s)]
*  she became vice president. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=69.44s)]
*  A new AP poll found voters are nearly split on whether Trump or Harris would do a better [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=71.2s)]
*  job on the economy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=76.04s)]
*  Do they—are they aware of the $93 trillion Green New Deal that would destroy capitalism? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  Are they aware she has proposed the largest tax increase in the history of the world? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=83.2s)]
*  Anyway, Trump does have a slight edge on that, as more and more experts are coming out against [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=88.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris and her economic policies. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=94.0s)]
*  Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary revealed that he spoke with Harris' advisers to better [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=96.44s)]
*  understand her policies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=101.84s)]
*  And here's what he had to say after that conversation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=103.72s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=106.56s)]
*  When querying about this idea of taxing unrealized capital gains, which would basically destroy [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=108.2s)]
*  the economy and change the way every investor would invest and chase capital out of the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=114.36s)]
*  country, I've been told, listen, don't worry about it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=118.08s)]
*  Just be happy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=121.48s)]
*  There's no way Congress would ever pass that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=122.56s)]
*  She has to keep saying that to keep her base happy, to bring people out to vote for her. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=125.12s)]
*  But that's not going to happen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=129.12s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=130.52s)]
*  These policymakers that are giving me this, just be happy, well, maybe I'm going to have [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=131.52s)]
*  But right now I'm not happy and I really, really want some policy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=136.55999999999997s)]
*  I really do. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=141.32s)]
*  And I think the rest of the market does too. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=142.32s)]
*  And that that comment gives you some idea about how much angst there is out there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  And according to a new report, it sounds like the American people will have a lot to worry [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=150.16s)]
*  about. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=154.56s)]
*  The Tax Foundation found that Kamala's tax plan would cost the U.S. economy nearly 800,000 [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=155.56s)]
*  jobs and unemployment has been on the rise. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=161.92s)]
*  But Trump, on the other hand, is considering policies that will help working class Americans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=165.16s)]
*  At his rally on Long Island early this week, he suggested a temporary cap of 10 percent [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=171.32s)]
*  on credit card interest rates to help the Americans that have been struggling because [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  of Biden-Harris inflation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=181.6s)]
*  He also said no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  And the president keeps expanding out his tax breaks for hardworking Americans by saying, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=188.64s)]
*  Well, no tax on overtime either. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=193.8s)]
*  Here with reaction, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy is with us. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=195.96s)]
*  She did, in her own words, propose a co-sponsor, the 93 trillion dollar Green New Deal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=200.34s)]
*  That to me would end capitalism as she know, as we know it, on top of the largest tax increase [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  in American history, including taxing unrealized capital gains. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  Again, that would end capitalism as we know it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=218.36s)]
*  That basically is Marxism, the way I understand it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  I want to get your take on it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=225.72s)]
*  And the fact that they're saying to Kevin O'Leary, oh, just be happy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=227.56s)]
*  None of that's going to happen. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=232.0s)]
*  Well, those are her stated policies. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=233.56s)]
*  That's her in her own words. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=236.88s)]
*  Are you saying don't believe what she says? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, Sean, I've read the vice president's plan, such as it is. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=243.76s)]
*  Basically, her plan is, let's do the dumbest thing possible that won't work. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't know who wrote her plan. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=256.76s)]
*  I don't hate anybody, but I wouldn't put that person in charge of a ham sandwich. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=258.84s)]
*  The biggest economic problem facing America today is high prices, duh. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=265.44s)]
*  And those high prices were caused by the policies of President Biden and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  Vice President Harris. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=275.56s)]
*  What's her plan to lower those prices? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=277.32s)]
*  Number one, price controls. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=279.88s)]
*  Sure, let's follow Castro in Cuba and Venezuela and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=282.44s)]
*  the former Soviet Union, all of which tried price controls and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  all of which experienced higher prices and mass hunger. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=292.88s)]
*  The second part of her plan is race taxes. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  Ms. Harris wants to raise the top personal income tax rate. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=302.52s)]
*  She wants to raise capital gains taxes. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=308.84s)]
*  She wants to raise inheritance taxes. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=311.96s)]
*  She wants to raise corporate income taxes. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=314.44s)]
*  She wants to tax unrealized capital gains for the first time in American history. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=317.44s)]
*  She even wants to tax wealth. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=323.28s)]
*  And she believes we're one tax increase away from prosperity. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=325.8s)]
*  I don't know a single economist who has said it will work. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=331.0s)]
*  The Tax Foundation did a very careful analysis. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=337.0s)]
*  As you said, the Tax Foundation says that Ms. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  Harris' plan will cost us about 800,000 jobs. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=343.84s)]
*  It'll shrink the economy about 2%. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  It'll cut wages at least 1.2%. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=351.76s)]
*  And in my judgment, it'll also cause prices to go even higher. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, this plan is like a rock, only dumber. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=361.68s)]
*  If you raise corporate taxes, correct me if I'm wrong, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=370.56s)]
*  I don't think corporations pay taxes. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=374.36s)]
*  Any increase in taxes will be passed on to consumers. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=376.32s)]
*  If you double the capital gains tax and you tax unrealized capital gains, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=380.8s)]
*  by the way, good luck trying to figure that out, be it a real estate investment or [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=387.0s)]
*  an investment in the stock market. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  I find this madness, by the way, and if you pay taxes on gains and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=394.64s)]
*  eventually you don't realize them because the stock goes down or [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=398.56s)]
*  the property value goes down to get your money back. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=401.92s)]
*  I think that would be a question we need an answer to. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=405.0s)]
*  And then you add the Green New Deal to it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=408.48s)]
*  I don't see how this economy could hold up. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=412.08s)]
*  Every time socialism, Marxism, whatever you wanna call it, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  whatever manifestation it has taken on, has ever been tried, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=420.96s)]
*  it always ends the same way. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=425.04s)]
*  Unfulfilled promises and more poverty and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=426.96s)]
*  a loss of freedom that you give up in the name of false security. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=431.64s)]
*  Am I wrong, Senator? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=435.68s)]
*  No, if you corner President Biden's Treasury officials, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=439.08s)]
*  even they will admit that these high prices are permanent. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=445.08s)]
*  The only way to deal with these high prices is to grow out of them. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=451.68s)]
*  5,000 years of human experience demonstrates that you can't increase [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=457.8s)]
*  personal wealth, you can't increase a country's wealth without increasing output. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=463.92s)]
*  Ms. Harris' plan is to reduce output. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=471.04s)]
*  She wants to tax people, she wants to tax businesses so [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=474.84s)]
*  they have less money to spend and invest. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=480.12s)]
*  When you tax something, you get less of it, duh. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=483.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, Senator, maybe you'll have to give her a tutorial in [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=488.24s)]
*  Economics 101 because I think it's definitely needed. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=493.24s)]
*  Senator Kennedy, as always, thank you. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVN0tuIPLiA&t=500.36s)]
