# WATCH: Marco Rubio asked about potential VP nod
**Fox News:** [June 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo)
*  And welcome back to Hannity as we continue live. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=0.0s)]
*  We're in the spin room in Atlanta. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=3.24s)]
*  And tonight, mass panic in the Democratic Party. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=6.0s)]
*  Donald Trump had an amazing night, an amazing debate. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=8.76s)]
*  Joe Biden delivered what was probably the worst debate performance in the modern televised [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=12.48s)]
*  history of presidential debates. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=18.56s)]
*  Here's yet another sad moment from your president. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=20.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=23.68s)]
*  I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=25.28s)]
*  I don't think he knows what he said either. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=49.0s)]
*  Look, we had the safest border in the history of our country. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=50.8s)]
*  Band here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=55.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=57.28s)]
*  Following the debate, President Trump walked off the stage. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=58.28s)]
*  Well, well, Joe Biden was greeted by Jill, who appeared to help him walk off the stage. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=60.24s)]
*  Here now, Florida senator, actually my senator from my home state, Florida, the free state [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  of Florida. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=70.44s)]
*  Mark, by the way, I apologize for, you know, some constituents. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=71.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=75.08s)]
*  We're happy to have you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=76.08s)]
*  First, let me ask you, your name is prominent now as a potential vice president. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=77.8s)]
*  And how do you feel about that? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=85.32s)]
*  Well, first of all, one person makes that choice and he's got a lot of really good [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=88.44s)]
*  people to pick from. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  And we got like 10 or 12 people that are better than Kamala Harris or anybody they can come [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  up with. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=95.52s)]
*  So I think anybody who's considered for that should be honored. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=96.52s)]
*  And if you have an opportunity to serve our country at that level, especially now with [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=98.8s)]
*  the disaster that we're facing, that's what Trump talked about tonight. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  So the two things I got from tonight's debate was, number one, life was better under Donald [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=105.92s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Americans had more money in their pocket. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  The world was a safer place. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=111.16s)]
*  America was more respected. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=112.64s)]
*  We didn't have eight or nine million people here illegally roaming around, including a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=113.96s)]
*  bunch of criminals and terrorists among them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=116.72s)]
*  So I think that point came across. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  But the other point that came across was the sense of urgency that we are now at this tipping [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  point where we can't afford another year like the last three years. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=126.56s)]
*  And so that was really theâ€”that sense of urgency we should all share. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=131.04s)]
*  So whether it's in the Senate or an opportunity to serve alongside a president who I know [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=134.72s)]
*  will do what he says, you know, those are the kinds of things that you would take very [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=139.28s)]
*  seriously and consider. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=142.72s)]
*  But again, no one wants to talk to me about it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=143.72s)]
*  And, you know, one guy makes that decision. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=145.56s)]
*  He's going to make a great choice. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=147.24s)]
*  You know, I say this, and I just feel that this country has been so good to me. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=148.24s)]
*  I know you tell your life story. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=153.44s)]
*  It's so compelling. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=154.96s)]
*  And I feel like I've had an undeserved life when I consider that my parents both grew [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=156.68s)]
*  My mom, the prison guard, my dad, family court probation guy and a waiter on weekends. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  And I've never been this worried about the state of the country or the state of the world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=167.16s)]
*  And I've been pointing out now for over four years Joe Biden's cognitive issues. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, with 130 days out, the rest of the Democratic Party and this [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=179.12s)]
*  corrupt media mob behind me, you know, they all of a sudden caught up and realized, oh, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  he's got a problem. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=190.04s)]
*  You know? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=191.04s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think we saw tonight what we've been seeing for a number of years. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=192.04s)]
*  And it's only progressively worse. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=196.16s)]
*  Earlier today I was watching they were putting a video of the debate just four years ago. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=197.64s)]
*  It's dramatically different from what he was just three or four years ago. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=201.34s)]
*  But let me tell you why that's relevant. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=204.2s)]
*  It's not just about making fun of the guy or whatever. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=205.2s)]
*  It's also about this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=207.8s)]
*  They're going to watch this debate or did in Beijing and in Moscow and in, you know, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=209.44s)]
*  Tehran. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=214.04s)]
*  And you worry that adversaries will see that and conclude from it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=215.04s)]
*  They got a weak president. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=218.52s)]
*  And it also makes you wonder, by the way, who's actually making and calling the shots [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=219.66000000000003s)]
*  in that White House? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=222.22s)]
*  I think increasingly it's pretty clear that this administration is being run by a bunch [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=223.22s)]
*  of deranged radicals who see it in their public policy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  So there's a lot to unpack there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  It's unfortunate for the country, but it's the reality. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=232.38000000000002s)]
*  And we saw today. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=235.02s)]
*  But this is the economy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=236.02s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=237.02s)]
*  Joe didn't seem to understand it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=238.02s)]
*  The border, President Trump went back to it again and again. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  I was so grateful to hear him mention the names of, you know, we have a 13-year-old [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=242.46s)]
*  girl brutally raped in broad daylight in New York, a 12-year-old girl, you know, ravaged [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=247.5s)]
*  for two hours, murdered in Houston, Texas, a mother of five murdered, Lake and Riley. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=253.5s)]
*  And the list goes on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=259.42s)]
*  It has to stop. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=260.42s)]
*  Every day, there's a new story about it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=261.42s)]
*  And look, these guys from this gang in Venezuela that have come into the country, they're [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=263.3s)]
*  they were criminals in Venezuela. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=267.22s)]
*  They're sending them here. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=268.22s)]
*  And they're coming here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=269.22s)]
*  And then you've got people that have got the guy that is actually fleeing murder charges [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=270.22s)]
*  in El Salvador that came here and murdered someone. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=273.18s)]
*  So it's case after case after case. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=276.1s)]
*  And now we find out today, you know, breaking news report that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=277.86s)]
*  ISIS. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=281.38s)]
*  Yeah, they're looking now for upwards of 50 to 400 people who were trafficked here by [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=282.38s)]
*  ISIS. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=286.22s)]
*  I asked the FBI director about this months ago. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=287.22s)]
*  This is a very dangerous situation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=288.58s)]
*  Four times in a row he said it's the worst it's ever been. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=290.5s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=292.66s)]
*  Senator, thank you for coming by. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=293.66s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=294.66s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=295.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=296.66s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntM8CM8nluo&t=297.66s)]
