# Pam Bondi wants transparency on the Epstein files, David Schoen says
**Fox News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA)
*  All right, earlier today, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, released phase one of the Epstein [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=0.0s)]
*  files. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=6.4s)]
*  That's transparency. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=7.4s)]
*  There are a lot of names in there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=8.78s)]
*  And Epstein was obviously a star chaser who wanted to hang out with people that are famous, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=10.84s)]
*  people with money. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=16.4s)]
*  So let me be very clear at the start here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  And I said this on my radio show today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=19.0s)]
*  People, because they're in the Rolodex, they're on the list, does not mean they did anything [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=20.76s)]
*  wrong. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=25.96s)]
*  On this show, and we have done it over and over again, we don't rush to judgment. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=27.06s)]
*  We believe in the presumption of innocence. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=30.46s)]
*  And I am appealing to people not to rush to judgment. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=33.54s)]
*  Even though these names are now public information, there are names that I'm certain were not [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=37.8s)]
*  involved or knowledgeable of this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=41.78s)]
*  I could be certain of it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=43.46s)]
*  But the biggest story tonight is which documents are missing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  This is the untold story. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  The attorney general, Pam Bondi, sent the new FBI director, Cash Patel, a fiery letter [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=49.9s)]
*  accusing the FBI, to be clear, not Cash at all, of withholding more documents, saying [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=54.739999999999995s)]
*  in part, quote, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=60.14s)]
*  "'Late yesterday I learned from a source that the FBI field office in New York was in possession [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=61.14s)]
*  of thousands of pages of documents related to the investigation and indictment of Epstein,' [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=66.86s)]
*  and while also writing to Cash, quote, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=72.66s)]
*  "'When you and I spoke yesterday, you were just as surprised as I was to learn this new [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=74.42s)]
*  information.'" [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=79.38s)]
*  Now, before adding that by 8 a.m. tomorrow the FBI will deliver the complete Epstein [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=80.78s)]
*  files to her office. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=86.06s)]
*  Now, I noticed a lot of people online rushing to judgment asking, why didn't they release [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=87.69999999999999s)]
*  it all? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=93.1s)]
*  There's a reason. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=94.1s)]
*  Well, they didn't know about these other documents that were withheld until about 24 [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=95.1s)]
*  hours ago. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=100.82s)]
*  And anyone telling you anything different, I know my sources, I've triple-checked, those [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  people would be wrong. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=107.46s)]
*  David, I want to hear your reaction. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, civil rights, criminal defense attorney David Schoen, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  who once represented Epstein. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  David, for that reason, I will start with you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=115.05999999999999s)]
*  I want to be clear. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  If people whose name might be in the guy's Rolodex, 254 alleged victims here that they've [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  identified, but if your name is in this, I don't want people to say, ah, there you go. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  He knew a lot of people. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=131.45999999999998s)]
*  He was a star chaser, a money chaser, meaning people with money like to hang out with him, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=132.45999999999998s)]
*  correct? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=137.18s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=138.9s)]
*  Also, people who had money and celebrities loved to hang out with him, frankly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=139.9s)]
*  They found him charming. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=143.02s)]
*  They sought his company. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  They did business with him and so on. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=145.26000000000002s)]
*  But let's separate the issues. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=146.74s)]
*  Pam Bondi, the attorney general, is looking for transparency for the American people. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=147.74s)]
*  I'm a fan of hers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=152.06s)]
*  She's a star. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=153.06s)]
*  She's right about seeking transparency. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=154.06s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=155.86s)]
*  The question, as you raised, it is correct also. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=157.16s)]
*  What's done with those records is important. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=159.74s)]
*  On your show, since the day I've known you, and I'm sure well before that, you have emphasized [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=161.66s)]
*  the importance of the presumption of innocence in every single case. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=166.22s)]
*  That holds true here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=169.56s)]
*  These are salacious facts that will come out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  People's names are involved. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=173.1s)]
*  Many of those people, or maybe all of those people, did nothing wrong with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=174.54s)]
*  There's a lot more to say about this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=180.66s)]
*  Yeah, and there's also a Rolodex of your names in there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  Greg, I'm sure you agree with all of us, but that's not the story to me. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  The story is the New York field office, they knew that the attorney general of our country [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=190.38s)]
*  was asking for these documents. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=196.14000000000001s)]
*  They didn't hand them over. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  I've got a big problem with that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=199.66s)]
*  Well, it could be criminal. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  The attorney general was sandbagged deliberately by our own employees at the FBI's New York [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=205.58s)]
*  field office, withholding thousands, as you point out, of documents, defying her order [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=211.22s)]
*  to hand everything over, and then lying about it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=217.22s)]
*  Nobody should be surprised at the deceit and the sheer arrogance of the FBI, because the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=221.9s)]
*  higher ranks are polluted with officials who think they're answerable to nobody. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=227.38s)]
*  They can do as they please, and they do. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=231.46s)]
*  It's become a cesspool of corruption, started with Bob Mueller accelerated under James Comey, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=234.68s)]
*  and Chris Wray did nothing to resolve it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  He covered it up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=244.46s)]
*  Ash Patel is his work to cut out, to purge the FBI, and I expect he will quickly identify [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=246.58s)]
*  and likely fire whomever committed this gross insubordination. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=252.74s)]
*  And by the way, those people better be on the phone tonight to good criminal defense [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=258.14s)]
*  attorneys, because willfully concealing documents from the attorney general misrepresenting [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=263.98s)]
*  the truth looks very much like obstruction of a federal agency. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=270.02000000000004s)]
*  That's a crime, and if two or more people are involved, that's conspiracy to obstruct [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=275.86s)]
*  justice. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=281.18s)]
*  So lawyer up, boys and girls. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=282.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=284.5s)]
*  What light can you shed on Jeffrey Epstein without violating attorney-client privilege? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=285.82s)]
*  David Schell. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  It's a very interesting question. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  One of the most interesting people I ever met. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=294.26s)]
*  He called me about 10 years before he died just to ask a question about he was getting [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  ready to go to jail, wanted some information. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=300.5s)]
*  Remember, he was represented by a team of terrific lawyers, many of them, some of the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=302.85999999999996s)]
*  biggest names in the country, for years. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=306.46s)]
*  About a year before he died, he asked me to review their work. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=309.06s)]
*  He was facing an action in Florida, and he was concerned. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=311.9s)]
*  He asked me to review their papers. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=314.94s)]
*  After he was arrested, he asked me to come to New York, and he hired me to, nine days [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  before he died, he hired me to take over his criminal case. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=320.97999999999996s)]
*  He told me that I was the only person in the world he trusted with his life, so I took [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=323.7s)]
*  that very seriously as a badge of honor. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=326.74s)]
*  A very interesting person. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  I never got his day in court. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=331.86s)]
*  We also need to understand, hanging on a bed that is very low to the ground, it seems there [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=333.54s)]
*  are a lot of questions there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=340.3s)]
*  Why was the camera not working? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=341.54s)]
*  Where were the prison guards? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=342.98s)]
*  We need a lot of answers here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=344.14s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBykeh0FlbA&t=345.90000000000003s)]
