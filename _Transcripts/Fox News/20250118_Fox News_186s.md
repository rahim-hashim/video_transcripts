# Stephen Miller: Big change is coming
**Fox News:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No)
*  By the way, joining us now with reaction incoming Trump White House Deputy Chief of Staff for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=0.0s)]
*  Policy Stephen Miller, one night from—one week from tonight, we'll have a lot to talk [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=4.2s)]
*  about. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=11.34s)]
*  If you come back on this program, what will we likely be able to say that Donald Trump [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=12.34s)]
*  accomplished in his first few hours as president? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=16.96s)]
*  Well, and I'll be glad to come back, Sean, and have that conversation with you then. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And here's what I will say. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  One thing that President Trump has been clear and consistent about this entire campaign [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=27.4s)]
*  is as soon as he gets into the Oval Office, he is going to sign the most comprehensive [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=32.6s)]
*  border security package by executive order in American history. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=37.36s)]
*  These executive orders will not only fully shut down the southern border, stop illegal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  immigration, begin the mass deportation of illegal aliens and criminals in our country, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=46.68s)]
*  they will also begin the process of eradicating the criminal cartel threat from this country [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=51.76s)]
*  once and for all, systematically dismantling every single transnational street gang that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=57.14s)]
*  is raping, murdering, maiming, attacking and otherwise wreaking havoc against our citizens. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=63.38s)]
*  That bill will ensure that every single element of this government is committed to restoring [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=69.98s)]
*  our national sovereignty—State Department, Defense Department, Department of Homeland [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=74.54s)]
*  Security, the Department of Justice, FBI, ATF, DEA, ICE and Border Patrol. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=78.36s)]
*  The president has also been clear. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=83.2s)]
*  He is going to drill, baby, drill. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=84.66s)]
*  He said this from the beginning. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=86.62s)]
*  He is going to unleash American energy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=87.62s)]
*  He is going to get control of the federal government, the federal workforce. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=89.54s)]
*  He is going to bring workers back to their offices. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=93.5s)]
*  He is going to end the travesty in which federal workers are pretending to work but are not [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=96.66000000000001s)]
*  actually working. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=100.86s)]
*  They are at home watching Netflix while you are paying their salaries. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=101.86s)]
*  He is going to make sure that the federal bureaucracy is accountable to the president [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=104.86000000000001s)]
*  and thus to the American people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  stop sending taxpayer dollars overseas where it does not belong. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=111.82s)]
*  And he is going to stop funding radical left-wing NGOs that hate Americans and hate the American [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=116.66s)]
*  people. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=121.41999999999999s)]
*  And he is going to stop the insanity of waste all across this federal government. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=122.41999999999999s)]
*  And he is going to fight to bring down inflation and to make life affordable again for Americans [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=128.24s)]
*  and so many other executive actions in the first day, in the first week, all throughout [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=132.18s)]
*  this presidency, Sean. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=136.64s)]
*  It sounds like shock and awe. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=138.46s)]
*  If you had to guess first two days, how many executive orders? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=140.06s)]
*  Well, I don't want to say exactly what number, but I will say this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  In terms of total executive actions, in other words, specific commands that President Trump [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  is delivering, there will be over 100 executive actions, commands to the bureaucracy to change [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=154.62s)]
*  their ways. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  Change is coming and it's needed and not a moment too soon. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=163.10000000000002s)]
*  Big change is coming. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=166.38s)]
*  Stephen Miller. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=167.38s)]
*  He's discredited. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  Trump is coming to save America. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  It's going to happen and it's going to happen next week. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQwgexRb8No&t=171.29999999999998s)]
