# Squid Game Season 2: Success Or Failure ? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww)
*  I was scared to start because people were dunking on it, but it was actually really [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=0.0s)]
*  good. I feel like the people who should talk to the same ones that were saying season two [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=3.0s)]
*  better not be a carbon copy of season one. I mean, it's never going to be as good as [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=6.96s)]
*  came at a time when we needed it the most revolutionary fervor was at an all time high. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=10.64s)]
*  I did one thing. I finished squid games and, or at least like the first, the first half [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=22.16s)]
*  of the games of the first seven episodes. And it cooked me because I wrote about this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=29.36s)]
*  in the discord as well. I wrote about this in the discord, but I'm old. I'm officially [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=35.12s)]
*  old. And what I mean by that is you guys know I'm officially old. You've known it. You've [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=40.0s)]
*  been telling me I'm old for like, since I was 28 actually, but isn't season one nine [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=48.32s)]
*  episodes though. No need to split into two seasons either. Well, I watched it up to the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  available amount of episodes, but yeah, it's season two is nowhere near as good, but it's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=58.4s)]
*  so it just gives me so much agita. It gives me so much agita chat. I get heartburn watching [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=63.2s)]
*  it. I get nervous watching it, you know, where I'm just like, I know in my mind that they're [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=72.04s)]
*  going to make it, but it's just, I don't like it. Alpha repeater. You're an American drink. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=78.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm wearing the same outfit. It's so basic. It's a black turtleneck with a black [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  jacket. Also, I have a beanie. It's different. It's actually different because I have a beanie. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=91.12s)]
*  Does your mom watch tiktoks like this too? I don't know what this is. Okay, hold on. I'm [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=96.48s)]
*  not looking at that. That's AI. The judge report headline on Elon Musk is taking me out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=101.72s)]
*  Dude, this is the link to the chat. Just like a like a sexy lady cosplay of X-Men. That's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=105.88s)]
*  crazy. That's a that's a crazy man. That sure is a crazy headline from the judge report. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=112.96s)]
*  But yeah, what was I saying? Yeah, rogue rouge rogue. I don't know. Yeah, watching squid [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=120.08s)]
*  games gives me anxiety, dude. And I can't sleep. And last night I was up. I was up to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=129.6s)]
*  like six foot. What is this? I was up to like three last night. I was up to like three last [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=136.88s)]
*  night because I just couldn't go to sleep after watching squid games, which I can't [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=145.36s)]
*  tell if that means I'm or if that means I'm old. It's crazy though. Shouldn't have happened. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  What is this absolute unit is making his career league debut. Oh, this brother is fair and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=156.44s)]
*  balanced. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=163.36s)]
*  so [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=166.84s)]
*  Yo, where's my three? Where's my three? Put that three up there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=196.84s)]
*  Put that three bomb up there. Hey, there it is. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=199.94s)]
*  Ah, 2006 voicemail ass beat. Yo, chill. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=203.44s)]
*  I was scared to start because people were dunking on it, but it's actually really good. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  I feel like the people who should talk to the same ones that were saying season two better not be a carbon copy of season one. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=211.74s)]
*  I mean, it's never going to be as good as came at a time when we needed it the most. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=217.44s)]
*  Revolutionary fervor was at an all-time high, you know. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=221.94s)]
*  Wasn't squid game one like didn't it happen during COVID too? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=226.14s)]
*  I don't even know. What is time? Time is a made up time is a made up construct. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=229.64s)]
*  I don't even know what time is honestly, but I feel like game one was pretty decent. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=233.64s)]
*  Even though I didn't like the ending standing was a little cheese and then season two is fine. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  It's not like it's not as good as season one. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24Fz_2Shww&t=245.14s)]
