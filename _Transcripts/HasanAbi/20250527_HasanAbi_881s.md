**HasanAbi:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg)
*  Anyway, that's just one example of like punishments that are dished out towards artists who are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=0.0s)]
*  vocal on this issue. Having said that this has not stopped Kaylani from still speaking [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=5.9s)]
*  out about the atrocities and being on the right side of history and being on the side [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=12.08s)]
*  of humanity. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=16.14s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. There it is. Kaylani on Gaza yesterday. I saw I'm going [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=17.14s)]
*  to talk about that. Hold on. Why is that? Dude, what is so she she beautifully she covered [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=28.56s)]
*  it beautifully. Okay. Like her take on it was was so perfect. She's like I shouldn't [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  be the only person. This shouldn't even be like like a commendable thing to say. Right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=42.32s)]
*  I'm gonna get to that in a second. I'm gonna get to that in a second. I'm gonna get to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=48.32s)]
*  that in a second. I'm gonna get to that in a second. Calm down. Go back to her video. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=52.16s)]
*  Are you guys insane? I'm gonna do it. I'm just showing you the blast off meme for a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=57.4s)]
*  second. God damn dude. Freaking go like the blast off meme first. Go like the blast off [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=61.96s)]
*  meme first. Don't nobody care about that tweet. I feel like something crazy just took place. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=68.28s)]
*  Okay. You know what? Even if she DMs me back to come on the stream, I'm gonna be like, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=73.44s)]
*  yeah, you know what? We're not gonna do it because you guys have been bad. Are you happy? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=77.96s)]
*  You've been bad. You've been bad. Now I'm not gonna have her on the stream. Yeah. I [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=82.76s)]
*  hope you guys are happy. I'm turning this car around. I'm turning. I'm turning this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=89.76s)]
*  car around. Yep. You guys have been misbehaving. You have been misbehaving little children [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=94.12s)]
*  and misbehaving little children don't get to have Kehlani on the stream. Yeah. Yep. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  It's called collective punishment and some of you need to learn. You need to make sure [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  your siblings in the chat are not misbehaving. Okay. I told you I was gonna turn this car [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=111.84s)]
*  around. I will. I will turn this car around. Okay. Anyway. All right. Speaking of Kehlani [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=117.36s)]
*  last night, you got the AMA's the I guess it's the American Music Awards, right? And [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=128.24s)]
*  it was sparsely attended, surprisingly, from what I understand. Aside from aside from the Oh, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=134.48s)]
*  by the way, shout out to friends of the show. Billy Eilish also tangential friend of the show [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=142.16s)]
*  is a consequence of Phineas being a firm friend of the show. You know, we support Billy around [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=149.48s)]
*  these parts. This is a Billy Eilish household. This is a pro Billy Eilish household. Make no [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=156.2s)]
*  mistake. But yeah, from what I understand, nine out of 10 people who were nominated for big [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=162.84s)]
*  awards weren't even there. And I don't even know what's happening. I don't know what's going on [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=167.04s)]
*  with that. Like people just don't for the war shows anymore. Is that what it is? But yeah, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=171.12s)]
*  that's a bit of a stretch. Come on, bud. Wait, what's the stretch? I don't think that's that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=177.32s)]
*  much of a stretch. Is that is that a stretch? I feel like that's not a stretch. Name one song chat. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=182.68s)]
*  Don't ask me that, you know, gun to my head. It killed me. I don't I mean, I listen to no music. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=188.12s)]
*  I'm just saying I still support. I support musicians. I support the process of music being [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=195.56s)]
*  made. And also people listening to it. Music, I mean, I support music conceptually. As a part of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=204.84s)]
*  people's lived experiences, I support music as a concept and artists that make it. This is my most [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=216.76s)]
*  like Mark Zuckerberg, alien wearing a human skin suit moment. I know. It's weird. I know. I know [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=226.04s)]
*  is weird. There's something about here's the thing. Here's the thing. Here's the thing before we get [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  to Kehlani. OK, there is something about music that like for my whole life, I don't know what it [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=240.2s)]
*  is. OK, I've never been able to like, I guess I've never been able to like recall lyrics. And I have [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=246.2s)]
*  really bad recall when it comes to like popular culture in general. Like if you were to gun to my [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=252.44s)]
*  head five songs, I can't do it. Like I literally can't do it. And this is not like like a post [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=257.96s)]
*  covid parts of my brain have holes in it type shit like I have always been this person. I am [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=264.12s)]
*  like I'm so I don't know what it is. I might it might be because I'm like tone deaf or something. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=271.08s)]
*  I don't know. It's just I can never like I I don't think I consume music in the same way that normal [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=276.04s)]
*  people do. And it's always been a gripe that I've had. OK, it's always been an issue. But but [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  especially as I've gotten older, especially as I've gotten older, this thing that's like [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  integrals of so many people's lives, so many people's existence is is simply not a part of my [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  simply not a part of my my life. I know it's weird. I know it's messed up. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=304.12s)]
*  Anyway, on that note, I do love artists like artists are fantastic people. They're very cool [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=309.4s)]
*  people. And like when I listen to a song, I can get hyped up. But it is very odd for me. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=313.96s)]
*  And I know it's odd. I know I'm the weird one. I know I'm the weirdo here. But there's never a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  moment where I'm like, yo, let me put some let me put some music on, you know, let me put some music [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=327.32s)]
*  on and listen to it. Like, it's crazy. It's crazy that that that is not something that I do. But I [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  think because I've faked being into shit my whole life when I was younger in order to fit in in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=338.68s)]
*  order to like appear as a normal, cool person, I just don't entertain it anymore. I'm thirty three. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=347.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? I have no reason to like lie about certain things. But I did that my whole [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=353.72s)]
*  life. I lied about like enjoying soccer. I can't watch it. I can't stand it. You know, so that's it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=359.64s)]
*  Having said that, I still do listen to music every now and then. I want to be like tapped in. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  Unk needs to be thirty three and tapped in. OK, so yeah, every now and then, every now and then [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  I'll just come out and I'll swing for the fences with some crazy like when Osama's son sent me [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  his album and merchandise, you know, bro. Thirty three is not what I don't get what the internet [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  acts like this. Brother, we got one foot in the grave. All right, big dog. Do you have veneers? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=393.8s)]
*  No. Wait, what? Why? Have you ever done anything to your teeth? They look good. Do you have veneers? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=400.76s)]
*  No, no. And they're like, see, they're weird. I have crooked teeth in the bottom, but I've never [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=406.12s)]
*  actually gone and fixed up because they're not like super crooked. They're not crooked enough. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=416.12s)]
*  That like it needed intervention. It's a lot of it. It's a little crooked in the bottom. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=419.8s)]
*  They look different in older vids. Hum. Wait, what? My teeth look different. And wait, you think I, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=438.92s)]
*  you think I got veneers? That's sick. Nice. Teeth conspiracy. Yeah, it's true. It's like when people [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=448.35999999999996s)]
*  say I'm on steroids, you know, to be fair, I don't look like I'm on steroids. I'm not saying fake [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  glasses, fake teeth. What else? I don't know. This screaming singer met cutie. Wait, this screaming [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=467.88s)]
*  singer. Wait, is Benson Boone technically the screaming singer? I thought it was like the other [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=473.4s)]
*  guy that's like, you'll be out in the suburbs or whatever. The is Benson Boone, the screaming singer. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=478.68s)]
*  He's the biggest screamer. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=491.64s)]
*  He thinks your hair it's fake. He got me. What Zoomers see when they hear 30 year olds go out. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=496.44s)]
*  It's true. This is real though. This is how it is. This is how it be. This is how it really is, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=503.32s)]
*  bro. Wait, Bernard is in Ireland right now. Bernard is in Ireland. The fuck? Bro, Zoomers call 28 [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=509.0s)]
*  old now. That's crazy. Bro, Zoomers are 28. You can't be calling 28 old if your generation is a [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=516.28s)]
*  part of that. Jen Alpha is probably calling Zoomers old now. That's what's going on. Your hair is so [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=521.8s)]
*  fake. That's why we've seen you get haircuts on stream multiple times and it always grows back. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=528.12s)]
*  Yeah. Cancel the streaming. Get on the plane. All right. Fuck it. Fuck it. I'm going to Ireland. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=531.88s)]
*  I'm going to Ireland. I'm real. I saw some 30 plus year olds at EDC and I was unironically grossed [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  out. You mean Will Neff and March. Is that what you're talking about? March is in the chat. He [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  said, what the fuck? I'm 29. Is this my future? Yes. Also, there's nothing wrong with being old. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=547.08s)]
*  Okay. I don't have any issues with this. I don't have any issues with my age. To be fair, I am a [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=553.72s)]
*  man. So I'm not only a man, but also a man who does political commentary. So like the more I age, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=558.12s)]
*  the more I guess like it becomes age appropriate for me to do political commentary to begin with. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=565.4s)]
*  But that's not the only reason. Like I just, you know, there are issues with aging, but you should [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=571.88s)]
*  probably try and focus on aging gracefully. Like I have gray hairs coming from the sides of my head, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=580.04s)]
*  you know, on the side of my beard. I think it's fine. You know, people should stop freaking out [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=586.44s)]
*  about it and enjoy life. You know, I got grazed at 23. You're not balding though, which is the worst. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=593.48s)]
*  I mean, I was, I was balding. I was balding when I was like 26, 27. And I started the process of [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=602.84s)]
*  medical intervention to stop it. And I am still, I am still like insecure to a certain degree about [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=613.32s)]
*  my, the way my hairline looks, but it's not, you know, for most people, they don't think, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=623.0s)]
*  they don't consider it like they don't think it's like bad. I'm personally insecure about it though. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=630.44s)]
*  What are you using? Minoxidil? Finasteride? All right. So American Music Awards, Kehlani is there. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=635.48s)]
*  Let's take a look at this question. Now, for those of you who don't know Kehlani has been a [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=641.72s)]
*  massive supporter of Palestinian emancipation and as a consequence of being a massive supporter of [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=646.6s)]
*  Palestinian emancipation, she has literally had gigs stopped, okay. In New York City, as a matter [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=653.72s)]
*  of fact, according to New York City mayor Adam's office, the concert was canceled due to security [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=661.88s)]
*  concerns. Kehlani was scheduled to perform as a part of summer stage in central park during [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=667.48s)]
*  pride festivities in June. And they basically created like false security concerns to cancel [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=671.56s)]
*  her concert. Okay. It's not the real reason. The real reason is because there was tremendous [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=679.4799999999999s)]
*  pressure. There was tremendous pressure on not letting her take the stage because she's a vocal [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=687.0799999999999s)]
*  critic of Israel and Eric Adams being the charlatan that he is and being the number one defender of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=693.0s)]
*  Israel and also Turkey. Istanbul, the Tel Aviv of America basically shut off her performance ahead [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=701.16s)]
*  of time, which is really fucked up. Anyway, that's just one example of like punishments that are [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=710.8399999999999s)]
*  dished out towards artists who are vocal on this issue. Having said that, this has not stopped [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=716.12s)]
*  Kehlani from still speaking out about the atrocities and being on the right side of [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=723.0s)]
*  history and being on the side of humanity. Let's take a look. You speak out about Gaza. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=727.64s)]
*  Why is that so important? Because it shouldn't be a hard thing. It shouldn't be a hard thing. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5yZRh-UHg&t=733.16s)]
