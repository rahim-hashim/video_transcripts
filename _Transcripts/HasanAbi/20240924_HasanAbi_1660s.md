# Rashida Tlaib vs. Dana Nessel: Truth Revealed | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4)
*  New York didn't do that, bro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what's even crazier about this being in Michigan. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1.1400000000000001s)]
*  When you're the Democratic attorney general of the democratic state of Michigan, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=4.4s)]
*  which is run by a Democrat that is relatively popular, a state that is [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=9.1s)]
*  comprised of a ton of Muslims and Arabs. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=13.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=16.28s)]
*  Now let's get to another glaringly obvious hypocrisy in the way that Muslims [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=24.36s)]
*  and Palestinians are viewed by all of our institutions and how easy it is and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=29.28s)]
*  how expected it is that you can just simply lie about a Muslim woman, a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=33.64s)]
*  Palestinian woman, even if they are a Democratic party politician, a Congresswoman. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Michigan attorney general falsely calls representative Rashida Tlaib. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  In the spring, anti-Israel activists took over part of the main thoroughfare [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=51.16s)]
*  at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=54.52s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=57.08s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=57.84s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=58.44s)]
*  They have a sign that says long live the Antifada. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=59.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=61.84s)]
*  It's so scary that I'm wearing my dog tag, my IDF dog tag on campus. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=62.08s)]
*  Maybe it's not so scary. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=67.28s)]
*  Anytime I see that I'm like, bro, listen, listen, dog, listen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=68.88s)]
*  To me, that is worse than wearing of Hamas headband. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=72.72s)]
*  I know that is not the same in the way that it's analyzed by American society, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  but that is precisely what it is. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=80.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=83.36s)]
*  The star of David and IDF dog tag. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=84.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude, because I'm insane that I'm looking at this star of David and calling [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=86.88s)]
*  it a dog tag and not the IDF dog tag that's in front of the star of David. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=91.2s)]
*  Maybe I just know more than you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=95.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=97.28s)]
*  Have you ever considered that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=98.16s)]
*  Have you ever factored that into your equation before jumping to conclusions [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=99.24s)]
*  like trying to immediately bait some kind of like perceived out of me as a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=102.08s)]
*  goddamn swastika he's wearing on his chest, that IDF dog tag, okay? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=107.72s)]
*  Not the star of David. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=111.12s)]
*  I'm so scared. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=112.4s)]
*  What this little broccoli hair is doing in this, this zoomer cut broccoli cut dip [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=113.72s)]
*  is doing here, okay, is 100% no different than if he had a swastika. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=119.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=127.08s)]
*  You got the same haircut. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=127.72s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=128.68s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=129.0s)]
*  Anga, bro. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=129.72s)]
*  Anga, for real, is a big problem on these college campuses. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=130.84s)]
*  Anga, he's so scared, bro. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=133.76s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=135.88s)]
*  Look at how scared he is, bro. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=136.8s)]
*  For real. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  I can feel the fear in his eyes, dude. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=140.08s)]
*  Look, I'm telling you right now straight up, this is ironically something that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=142.68s)]
*  the media also escalated in 2016. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=147.68s)]
*  You would have that are straight up Nazis be like, I have no diversity of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=151.0s)]
*  opinion on college campuses and the media would literally elevate them to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=155.52s)]
*  prominence all the time, all the goddamn time, and it was so frustrating. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=160.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=165.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  He's so scared. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  He's standing right by the encampment rocking the goddamn IDF dog tag too. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=167.08s)]
*  Terrified. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=171.28s)]
*  I mean, terrified. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=172.08s)]
*  They used to do this all the goddamn time in 2016. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=173.28s)]
*  Nazis would do this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=177.32s)]
*  They'd be like, Oh, well, I just have different opinions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=178.28s)]
*  What are those different opinions that black people shouldn't go to the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=181.36s)]
*  same school as white people? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=185.04s)]
*  That was a different opinion you had. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=186.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=188.16s)]
*  And people were obviously understandably bullying you for it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=188.6s)]
*  Same goes for this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=191.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=192.36s)]
*  If you're such a gross that you're rocking an IDF dog tag on college [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=193.44s)]
*  campus and people go, Hey man, that's kind of up, you're a little bit of a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=197.52s)]
*  piece of aren't you? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=200.88s)]
*  And they go, Whoa, are you saying that? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=202.12s)]
*  Cause I'm a Jew. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=204.4s)]
*  Well then you're an asshole. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=206.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=207.28s)]
*  Goofy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=208.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  What's happening here? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=212.68s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=213.84s)]
*  And that's just, you know, a callback from the second antifada and not a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  comfortable feeling when I woke up this morning, I went to walk. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=218.8s)]
*  Oh, my comfort. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=221.76s)]
*  My comfort in my Michigan college campus is significantly more important than [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=224.28s)]
*  the fundamental principle behind the first amendment right to, you know, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=231.36s)]
*  free protest, if you're hurting my comfies, if you're hurting my fee fees, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  you shouldn't be able to protest America's unimaginable loyalty to the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  death and destruction that Israel is doing in Gaza. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=245.28000000000003s)]
*  You can't protest that it's hurting my feelings. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=248.4s)]
*  No. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=252.72s)]
*  I went to class. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=254.48s)]
*  It was the first time this semester. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=255.2s)]
*  I had to walk around the diag. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=257.08s)]
*  Now the protest. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=258.68s)]

*  No dude, man. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=261.52s)]
*  Yo, we should extra Palestinian children for that one. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=263.47999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=266.64s)]
*  I wanted to run around. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=269.24s)]
*  I wanted to run around. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=270.96s)]
*  And then when I was going to class, I had to walk around the encampment and they [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=272.08s)]
*  were saying that what Israel is doing is, and it hurt my feelings because I do [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=277.0s)]
*  think Israel is doing it, but I like it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=281.56s)]
*  It's really messed up. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=283.56s)]
*  They kept saying, they kept saying that my IDF dog tag was, was, was me firmly [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=285.04s)]
*  being committed to bloodshed, which is true. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=291.68s)]
*  It's got more heated at different times throughout the year. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=295.0s)]
*  And right now 11 participants. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=297.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=299.28s)]
*  Ethnic intimidation, results of a police officer, assault of a police officer, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=299.48s)]
*  resisting arrest, misdemeanor trespass, destruction of personal property [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=303.16s)]
*  and disturbing the peace. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=307.0s)]
*  And the Michigan attorney general can suck my okay. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=308.52s)]
*  Her for literally prosecuting student protesters. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=310.64s)]
*  Dumbass. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  It's in the protest. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=317.0s)]
*  Some of them students, some of them not are being prosecuted. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  Michigan attorney general Dana Nestle's office alleges among the committed during [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=320.84s)]
*  the 30 day takeover of the school are quote, uh, ethnic intimidation and assault [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=324.36s)]

*  Now, when those charges were announced a few days ago, Michigan, democratic [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=335.44s)]
*  congresswoman Rashida to leave of Michigan said that the charges were frivolous. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=338.64s)]
*  Even New York didn't do that, bro. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=343.2s)]
*  That's what's even crazier about this being in Michigan. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=344.64s)]
*  When you're the democratic attorney general of the democratic state of Michigan, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=347.91999999999996s)]

*  comprised of a ton of Muslims and Arabs. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=359.8s)]
*  Like you taking this position is insane. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=363.88s)]
*  This happens in, in Texas. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  You're like, okay, it's still up. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=366.88s)]
*  It's still, you know, unimaginably cruel and, and, uh, glaringly obvious hypocrisy, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=368.96s)]
*  but like it's Texas, you know what I mean? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=374.68s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  And I do believe it's a political statement for her to capitulate to pressure. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=378.52s)]
*  And a quote, shameful attack on students' rights. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  And then congresswoman to leave said, quote, it seems that the attorney [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=388.52s)]
*  general decided if the issue was Palestine, she was going to. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=391.08s)]
*  Imagine if black people are embraced like this every time we said we were attacked. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=394.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=397.84s)]
*  The difference is like black people are actually attacked and intimidated. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  And also institutions do defend that process and institutions [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  actually churn out that process. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=406.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=408.68s)]
*  It is very different than the way festers in society and what that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  person is using as like an attack. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  What that person is talking about does not even correspond to the historic [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=416.44s)]
*  precedent, okay, in terms of, this isn't to say it does not exist. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=419.64s)]
*  I'm not saying that at all. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=423.6s)]
*  Of course it does, but that's not how it manifests. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  Like black people aren't complaining. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  This is, that's why it's more similar to like a straight up Nazi being like, or a [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=430.76s)]
*  straight up conservative being like, Oh, they're attacking Christians. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  They're attacking me because I'm a Christian male, you know? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=439.56s)]
*  Like what the are you talking about? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=442.8s)]
*  Your position as a Zionist is literally adopted by the American State Department. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=444.24s)]
*  It is straight up the current position. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=451.04s)]
*  That's why the pro-Israel protests were hilarious. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=453.6s)]
*  It's like, what are you protesting? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=456.56s)]
*  More dead children? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=457.64000000000004s)]
*  Like they're going to give that for you. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=458.6s)]
*  They're going to give that to you no matter what, even if you protest, if you [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=460.20000000000005s)]
*  don't protest, it's going to happen. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=462.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  It is already the status quo. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=465.0s)]
*  That's why it's so laughable when people try to be like, yeah, it's a really brave [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=466.24s)]
*  position to come out and be in support of Israel on mainstream media. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=471.32000000000005s)]
*  Like, wow, dude, thank you for your brave and bold take. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  What's next? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=479.32000000000005s)]
*  Saying that you're pro-American military. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=480.08s)]
*  Another bold take, huh? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=482.68s)]
*  Treated differently. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=484.76s)]
*  And that alone speaks volumes about possible biases within the agency she runs. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=485.76s)]
*  Unquote. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=490.68s)]
*  Now that comment left some in Michigan, including attorney general Nestle with [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=491.32s)]
*  the impression that Congresswoman Tlaib was accusing Nestle, who was Jewish, with [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=495.68s)]
*  letting her religion affect her decision to prosecute, especially given the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  bipartisan vote in Congress last November to censure Congresswoman Tlaib [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=504.28s)]
*  for her comments about Israel. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=508.8s)]
*  That's part of the context here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  We asked Congresswoman Tlaib to come on the show today to clarify. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  She did not respond to our request. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=515.16s)]
*  We asked her office to clarify what bias does Nestle have or her office? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  And they did not give us an answer. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=521.76s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, they didn't do that because you lied. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=523.08s)]
*  And today you were forced to basically do a subtle apology, which Dana Bash [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  also gave a clarification on. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=531.32s)]
*  Dana Bash yesterday, everywhere it comes from both into the political spectrum [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=534.36s)]
*  and Rashida Tlaib participated in this. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=538.08s)]
*  Dana Bash today. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=540.96s)]
*  ...a clarification on a story we brought you yesterday concerning Congresswoman [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=541.92s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib's comments attacking a decision by Michigan attorney general. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=545.76s)]
*  For the record, for the record, ain't nobody read the goddamn interview. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=550.2s)]
*  I did. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=553.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=555.36s)]
*  Another, another apology came here. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=556.52s)]
*  Well, not even an apology because these people are not people with any dignity. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=558.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=563.52s)]
*  So of course they're not apologizing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=564.32s)]
*  One, Governor Whitman, when your attorney general prosecutes people for law [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  harassing Jews and attacking police officers, it's in the interest of public safety. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=569.44s)]
*  When a congresswoman accuses the attorney general or prosecuting protesters simply [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=572.72s)]
*  because she's Jewish, it's bias. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=575.24s)]
*  Saying you want to make sure that the students are safe on our campuses is just [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=577.2s)]
*  words if you are not willing to use your bully public to speak out unequivocally [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=579.88s)]
*  on and support holding people accountable for law when it affects Jews. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  So as you already know, Jonathan Greenblatt straight up wants to, okay, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=586.0s)]
*  straight up, he wants them unmasked. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=591.08s)]
*  He wants them in jail and he wants them to never be able to speak again. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=593.88s)]
*  I am not even a little bit exaggerating on this. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=598.6800000000001s)]
*  He straight up has openly been like, you have to unmask them. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=601.6400000000001s)]
*  You have to unmask them. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  And as the leader of the apartheid defense league, he has been able to get [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=605.88s)]
*  away with a lot of his wishes. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=610.2800000000001s)]
*  He gets a ton of media time. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=612.36s)]
*  He goes on MSNBC all the time. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=614.2s)]
*  He goes on CNN all the time. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=615.32s)]
*  He is seen as the foremost authority on it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=616.6800000000001s)]
*  And what he does with that level of authority and influence is simply defend Israel. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=618.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=625.4s)]
*  That's why you rarely ever hear about him chirping about right-wing anti-right-wing. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=626.4s)]
*  Sometimes he'll talk about it only to basically maintain a shred of legitimacy as [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  though he does care about it, but he'll never do that if someone is a pro-Zionist. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=637.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=643.16s)]
*  You will never hear, you will never hear Jonathan Greenblatt on someone [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=643.88s)]
*  with the same severity. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=650.0s)]
*  If you are on the other hand, a Jew, he has all the smoke for you. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=651.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=655.3199999999999s)]
*  If you're a Jew, you need to go to jail. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=655.6s)]
*  You need to go to jail yesterday. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=657.16s)]
*  If you die in jail, I do not care. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=659.24s)]
*  That's his perspective. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=661.52s)]
*  He has so much more anger and resentment towards Jews as the head of the ADL than [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=662.52s)]
*  he does for Israel defenders. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=668.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=672.76s)]
*  Just understand that. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=673.4399999999999s)]
*  It's so funny that they refused to show the full context even now, even in their [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  clarification. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=699.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=701.12s)]
*  She, like even this is not the full quote. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=702.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=705.6s)]
*  It is so goddamn sickening that the media is doing this in any other [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=706.4s)]
*  circumstance. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=712.52s)]
*  If this level of slander was being done to a prominent white man in the Republican [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=713.36s)]
*  party, there is a media infrastructure that would pounce on CNN. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=721.12s)]
*  This would be wall to wall coverage on Fox News. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=727.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=730.36s)]
*  Straight up. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=730.9599999999999s)]
*  But when you're Palestinian, nobody defends you. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=732.28s)]
*  When you're Arab, nobody defends you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=735.12s)]
*  When you're Muslim, nobody defends you. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=737.4s)]
*  The Democratic party won't defend you and the institutions that are supposed to [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=739.3199999999999s)]
*  correctly and accurately report on the truth will drop the ball and not even drop [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=743.68s)]
*  the ball, but like deliberately lie about you. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=748.68s)]
*  This has happened time and time again. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=751.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  This happened with Ilhan Omar quite a bit and it happened with Keith Ellison. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=754.12s)]
*  It happened with and it happened with Rashida Tlaib in the past. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=758.4399999999999s)]
*  It is happening with her again. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=761.4s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he's still glazed Donald Trump while giving tepid criticisms, tepid [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=768.76s)]
*  condemnation of Trump's remarks because Trump is at the end of the day, very good [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  for Israel and Jonathan Greenblatt cares about that more than anything else. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=778.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=782.4s)]
*  He does not care about, and this is not an accusation that I'm launching against [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=783.12s)]
*  someone without any evidence whatsoever. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=786.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=789.6s)]
*  Straight up time and time again, Jonathan Greenblatt and the ADL has proven that [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  their name is the apartheid defense league. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=796.2800000000001s)]

*  And also on top of that, a friend of Rashida Talib's and they just made it up [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1018.88s)]

*  Okay. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1038.92s)]

*  personally agree with this rhetoric. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1100.6000000000001s)]
*  Tensions were high. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1102.2s)]
*  You didn't understand the full depth of Israel's cruelty. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1103.3200000000002s)]
*  You did not understand the humanity of the Palestinians due to all the social [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1107.2800000000002s)]
*  conditioning surrounding the subject matter. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1112.3600000000001s)]
*  Now, almost a year after those remarks, you probably are way more understanding of [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1114.72s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib's position and probably laugh at Dana Nestle's position back then. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1121.2s)]
*  This is why from the river to the sea was my red line in many instances, a red [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1126.68s)]

*  community and in edge communities as well. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1136.04s)]
*  But the reason why I stood by Rashida Tlaib and was resilient in defending these [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1140.0s)]
*  statements is because I understand where they come from. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1145.8s)]
*  I understand the historic context in which these statements began and I [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1149.6s)]
*  understand what it looks like when you cave and capitulate to false framing [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1154.6s)]
*  that actually ascribes a falsehood to the statement. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1160.72s)]
*  A call for emancipation is not a call for death and destruction just because [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1164.28s)]
*  those who want to defend that death and destruction claim it's scary for them. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1169.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1173.88s)]

*  Okay. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1185.44s)]
*  You'll be back. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1186.72s)]

*  Why would you have the people to be, oh yeah, in the sixties if you said black [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1194.96s)]
*  power, this was the reaction. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1198.44s)]

*  lives matter, white supremacists got in their feelings about that too. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1206.24s)]
*  They desperately tried to work and mar the reputation and tarnish it and claim [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1210.48s)]
*  that that meant that you want to white people and they came up with their own [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1217.92s)]
*  slogan, all lives matter as a counter to black lives matter. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1221.96s)]

*  Palestinians should live free of the apartheid, free of the [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1245.72s)]
*  That's what they're angry about. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1256.24s)]
*  They'll attack the optics, but at the heart of the matter is the problem. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1257.8799999999999s)]
*  The problem that Palestinians should not be seen as worthy of dignity. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1262.84s)]
*  Their humanity should never be recognized because if you do, then all of a sudden [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1267.84s)]
*  Israel's actions become quite unconscionable and that's devastating to the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1273.0s)]
*  dianist, ethno-nationalist supremacist project. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1278.0s)]
*  Major media outlets in the head of the ADL amplified a fabricated and [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1282.0s)]
*  dangerous lie about Rashida Tlaib. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1284.84s)]
*  Not only that, they did it after another outlet targeted her with a caricature. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1286.72s)]
*  Anti-Palestinian bias is real. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1291.84s)]
*  This is case in point. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1293.32s)]
*  No one should be treated this way. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1294.32s)]
*  She thinks I can't be fair. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1295.84s)]
*  She also mischaracterized the charges. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1296.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think quite intentionally, I mean, she talked about this being peaceful [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1299.48s)]
*  protesters, no peaceful protesters were charged in this event. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1304.12s)]
*  And Rashida is a lawyer. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1309.0s)]
*  She had every opportunity to call me to ask to see the evidence in this case, but [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1311.72s)]
*  she didn't do that. You know, I, I have to rely on the facts, the law and the [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1315.5600000000002s)]
*  evidence when I go into a court of law. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1322.28s)]
*  And that's what we evaluated in this case. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1324.76s)]
*  And that's the only thing that we evaluated in terms of making a [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1327.16s)]
*  determination as to these charges. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1330.68s)]
*  I should note that I misspoke yesterday when asking a followup of governor [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1332.72s)]
*  Whitmer, who I asked about this, I was trying to characterize your views of [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1335.76s)]
*  Tlaib's comments. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1339.44s)]
*  What do you make of those today? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1340.76s)]
*  Noting that Congresswoman Tlaib never explicitly said that your bias was [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1342.72s)]
*  because of your religion. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1346.8799999999999s)]
*  And so it's unfair for you to make that allegation. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1348.24s)]
*  Well, a couple of things. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1351.32s)]
*  First of all, in twenty twenty two, when my opponent accused me of being a [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1352.72s)]
*  groomer and a pedophile, everyone understood that those were homophobic [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1357.96s)]
*  remarks because I happen to be gay. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1363.2s)]
*  Right. I didn't have to explain it to people. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1365.56s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib is an individual who is well known for making inflammatory [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1368.12s)]
*  inflammatory and incendiary remarks that are in nature. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1373.12s)]
*  So this isn't the first time that we would have heard these words out of her [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1376.08s)]
*  mouth. I think it's very clear to everybody exactly what she was saying. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1379.6399999999999s)]
*  But I have to say this, you know, it is my job to keep communities and [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1383.8s)]
*  campuses around the state of Michigan safe. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1388.6799999999998s)]
*  And that is exactly what we're doing. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1392.28s)]
*  I understand that the congresswoman has very strong feelings about what's [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1394.08s)]
*  happening in the Middle East. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1397.48s)]
*  So many people do here in the state of Michigan. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1398.76s)]
*  But, you know, that doesn't excuse behavior. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1402.44s)]
*  And the answer to what's happening in the Middle East clearly is not to have [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1405.2s)]
*  chaos and anarchy and lawlessness on our college campuses in a way that [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1410.04s)]
*  jeopardizes the safety of students. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1415.36s)]
*  It's my understanding that the University of Michigan is not displeased with [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1417.84s)]
*  charges being brought against people who were not peaceful protesters. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1422.72s)]
*  The university has not commented to me anyway, one way or another. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1426.44s)]
*  These cases were submitted to my office and we did a fair and impartial and [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1431.68s)]
*  extensive review. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1435.44s)]
*  And again, this evidence will be presented in a court of law. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1437.88s)]
*  But I don't think it's helpful to anyone to have the congresswoman commenting [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1442.24s)]
*  on the, you know, the merit of these cases when she's not familiar with the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1447.28s)]
*  facts for the evidence. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1451.4s)]
*  As a black guy, I can't help but be cynical over how much airtime mainstream [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1452.52s)]
*  media has been so eager to spend for centering white victims in their coverage [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1455.4s)]
*  of like the most ethnic Jewish person I've seen saying they were a victim on [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1458.2800000000002s)]
*  TV has been light skinned Italian. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1462.48s)]
*  I mean, a lot of the a lot of the pro-Israeli sentiment does come from people [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1464.24s)]
*  in positions of people in positions of privilege, like let's be real. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1468.88s)]
*  That's where it comes from. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1473.3200000000002s)]
*  No, I mean, that is what it is. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1474.72s)]
*  It's like that's why it is packaged in an identical capacity to it is packaged in an [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1476.6s)]
*  identical capacity to all this all this commotion that the media absolutely [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1483.56s)]
*  elevated in in the in the campus free speech protests, which were oftentimes [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1488.24s)]
*  conducted by straight up neo-Nazis. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1496.3999999999999s)]
*  Same as a black person. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1498.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1499.76s)]
*  I mean, you should understand it as a black person is because the the calls of [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1501.2s)]
*  bigotry are being conducted by those with privilege. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1507.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's the only reason why I get so much goddamn airtime. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1512.48s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1515.76s)]
*  Like the positions that these people have, the position that these people have are [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1516.84s)]
*  literally a point of a point of privilege. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1521.6799999999998s)]
*  Like, they're claiming that a reiteration of the American State Department's position [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1525.4s)]
*  on Israel is actually somehow a brave one is actually somehow putting them in harm's [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1533.0s)]
*  way. It's like saying, oh, they're attacking me because I'm pro cop. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1538.68s)]
*  Like, that's not a real thing, man. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1543.44s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1544.96s)]
*  Suck my. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1546.2s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1551.28s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1552.56s)]
*  Oh, man, they're attacking me because I said the American military is is good. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1553.6s)]
*  Do you see what I'm saying? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1559.1599999999999s)]
*  It is no different. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1560.36s)]
*  It does not matter. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1562.28s)]
*  It does not matter whether you are Jewish or not Jewish. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1564.0s)]
*  If your position is pro-Israel, OK, if you are repeating pro-Israel perspectives and [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1569.28s)]
*  pro-Israel positions and you try to claim that you are being attacked for said positions [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1575.76s)]
*  and that there is some victimhood to be extracted out of you being pro-Israel, you are a [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1582.5200000000002s)]
*  delusional loser. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1589.3200000000002s)]
*  It is a laughable, laughable notion that you would incur any penalties whatsoever for [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1591.16s)]
*  being pro-Israel. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1597.5200000000002s)]
*  It is ridiculous. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1599.2800000000002s)]
*  The inverse of that, however, is very true. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1600.72s)]
*  It is the most normal thing to incur penalties for being anti-Israel. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1603.1200000000001s)]
*  You are branded as an instantly. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1608.72s)]
*  Hassan Lukas like today, Gucci's commie cousin. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1610.76s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1613.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I like this tweet when I saw it. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1614.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. The fact that Tapper Greenblatt and others can engage in a multi-day defamation [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1617.08s)]
*  campaign against Rashida Tlaib by blatantly misquoting her and face zero repercussions [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1620.84s)]
*  for it is a great example of the institutional anti-Palestinian bias she called out in the [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1624.4399999999998s)]
*  first place, which is correct. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1629.1599999999999s)]
*  You think CNN will ever apologize for his coverage? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1630.6s)]
*  Yeah, dude, when pigs fly, OK, when pigs catch flight, CNN will apologize for smearing [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OkDGLx5Vy4&t=1632.6399999999999s)]
