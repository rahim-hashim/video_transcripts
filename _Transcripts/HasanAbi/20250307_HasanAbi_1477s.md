# Trump Hosts Crypto Summit At The White House | Hasanabi & Noah Kulwin Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw)
*  horrible lawfare against cryptocurrency. We really appreciate it. Like there's no shot [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=0.0s)]
*  that this is appealing. There is no shot that this is appealing to the average American [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=5.04s)]
*  because despite the fact that there are a lot of dummies out there who, you know, love [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=13.24s)]
*  cryptocurrency schemes and rug pulls and love getting rug pulled or whatever, there is zero [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  percent chance that the average American looks at this and thinks like, no, this is a, this [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=23.92s)]
*  is a great thing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=27.76s)]
*  Finally, finally, a more corrupt entity, a more nakedly corrupt entity that absolutely [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=33.56s)]
*  loves their there to give it loves the Gulf States. I assume that this is going to be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=38.88s)]
*  about FIFA and then quickly they're going to turn into they're going to turn around [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=48.32s)]
*  and talk about cryptocurrency, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=52.88s)]
*  What is happening here? I don't know, man. Everything about this presidency just always [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=57.64s)]
*  has this like, you know, like, like, what was it like when Ben Carson, like, just stopped [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=67.72s)]
*  straight up, like stopped walking, like when he was supposed to walk out on a base stage [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=74.08s)]
*  or whatever. Yeah, like, that's just how so much of like the staging of all this shit [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=77.56s)]
*  Even if it's an act, like it's all just a guy speaking not clearly into a microphone [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=83.16s)]
*  while there's like some trophy off center. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=91.32s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what the hell I don't know. I don't know what the hell is going on here [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=94.8s)]
*  at all. I'm so confused. The beautiful part about [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Wait, this happened yesterday. I think it was a TV issue was the Fox News stream that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=102.88s)]
*  these two were like, they had the split screen of like, it was Trump's face and then just [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=106.12s)]
*  like one camera like staring at like some piece of equipment. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=109.48s)]
*  I yeah, with with Dushi, I do love that every time Trump does one of these like pressers [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  or whatever, I just come out of it more confused than I than I came in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=120.4s)]
*  Like I had I had assertions that I'd made prior and then I listened to Trump speak and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=125.16s)]
*  I'm like, OK, this is indecipherable. Like every single time he talks, every single time [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=131.16s)]
*  he does something new, I'm like, OK, now I'm more confused. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=137.0s)]
*  What the is happening? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=140.24s)]
*  That coin may be worth more than FIFA in the end. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=142.52s)]
*  It could be quite a coin. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=146.68s)]
*  Wait, oh, they're doing that's like a thank you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=148.16s)]

*  I just thought you should see this trophy because it's really you know, it's the biggest [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=151.16s)]
*  sporting event in the world and we have it here and we appreciate being selected. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=154.52s)]

*  We have a lot of very distinguished people around the table. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=249.48s)]
*  Some of them will be. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=251.76s)]
*  I want to thank Marco Rubio also, who's right over there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=253.0s)]
*  And we have tremendous people very interested in the subject. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=256.96s)]
*  And last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world and the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=261.36s)]
*  crypto capital of the planet. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=266.76s)]
*  And we're taking historic action to deliver on that promise, as you know, around the table. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=268.32s)]
*  Yesterday, I signed an executive order officially creating our strategic Bitcoin Reserve. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=274.52s)]
*  I don't know how this works. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=280.56s)]
*  I just don't understand anything, dude. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=283.96s)]
*  United States Treasury. That's a big thing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=286.52s)]
*  It seems like the market doesn't seem to take it that seriously. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=290.64s)]
*  I'll say that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=293.64s)]
*  Like the price of Bitcoin went down. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=294.64s)]
*  I'm going to hit up Coffeezilla. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=296.36s)]
*  The federal government is already among the largest holders of Bitcoin, as you know, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=298.24s)]
*  really one of the largest holders in the world, with as many as 200,000 Bitcoin obtained [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=304.08s)]
*  via civil law and various other forms of law, including enforcement actions. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=310.64s)]
*  These existing holdings were formed the foundation of the new reserve. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=317.12s)]
*  The stockpile is the stuff that they got from like all the civet. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=321.24s)]
*  It has falsely sold tens of thousands of additional Bitcoin that were worth civil assets. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=324.48s)]
*  And then the reserve would be like, oh, we're making interventions to buy Bitcoin and take [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=330.6s)]
*  it off the market. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  Not a good thing to have done from this day on. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  America will follow the rule that every Bitcoin knows very well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Who's the guy that's been on Chavo? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  That's like the crypto guy. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=345.68s)]
*  I think it's like Weiss. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh, Jacob Silverman. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  Or Jacob Silverman. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=350.44s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=353.44s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=354.56s)]
*  But so far, it's been right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=355.2s)]
*  And well, let's keep it that way. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  The Treasury and Commerce Departments will also explore new pathways to accumulate additional [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=359.76s)]
*  Bitcoin holdings for the reserve, provided it's done at no cost to the taxpayers. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=365.12s)]
*  We don't want any cost to the taxpayers. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=370.56s)]
*  In addition, my order directs federal agencies to conduct an inventory of all crypto assets [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  currently held by the U.S. government and determine how they can be transferred easily [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=379.2s)]
*  to the Treasury. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=384.56s)]
*  Non-Bitcoin digital assets will be held in a new U.S. digital asset stockpile where they [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=386.24s)]
*  will be managed properly. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  My administration also is working to end the federal bureaucracy's war on crypto, which [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=395.68s)]
*  was really going on pretty wildly during Biden until the election came about. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=400.64s)]
*  About five months before the election, he became a big fan because he heard how many [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=406.08s)]
*  people were in favor of it and how many people love it and respect it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=411.36s)]
*  But I guess it didn't work out too well for him. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=416.8s)]
*  People understood what was going on and paved the way for groundbreaking innovations and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=420.08s)]
*  institutional finance. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=425.2s)]
*  Under the Bitcoin administration, regulators strong-armed banks. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=427.12s)]
*  I mean, they really did. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=431.6s)]
*  They strong-armed banks into closing the accounts of crypto businesses and entrepreneurs [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=432.48s)]
*  effectively blocking some money transfers to and from exchanges. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  And they weaponize government against the entire elite also. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=441.76s)]
*  If I was in that room, I'd be so fucking bored. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=446.32s)]
*  All of that will soon be over. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=449.44s)]
*  And we are ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=451.44s)]
*  I think David Sacks is thinking about how much money he's making from this from this [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=456.0s)]
*  dipshit. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=460.0s)]
*  Didn't he yesterday also pump David Sacks' coin or something? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  There was something like that over the weekend because they were like, we're going to be [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=464.88s)]
*  buying Cardano, Indian, XRP. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=467.35999999999996s)]
*  They came around, but they came around for the wrong reasons. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=470.88s)]
*  They came around only because they wanted votes. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=473.84s)]
*  And they saw that tens of millions of people are, you know, were against them because of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=476.79999999999995s)]
*  what they were doing. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=482.24s)]
*  I also want to express my strong support for the efforts of lawmakers in Congress as they [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  work on bills to provide regulatory certainty for dollar-backed stablecoins and the digital [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=488.32s)]
*  assets market. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  They're working very hard on that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=496.48s)]
*  This is a tremendous opportunity for economic growth and innovation in our financial sector. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=498.16s)]
*  And we'll really go a long way. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=503.76s)]
*  I think it's going to be a tremendous, a tremendous — we feel like pioneers, in a way, of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=506.96000000000004s)]

*  This is an industry that was subjected to prosecution and persecution for the last four [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=583.92s)]
*  years. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=587.84s)]
*  Horrible lawfare, and nobody knows what that feels like. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=588.4s)]
*  Horrible lawfare against cryptocurrency. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=591.28s)]

*  There is no shot that this is appealing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=594.72s)]
*  There is no shot that this is appealing to the average American because despite the fact [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  that there are a lot of dummies out there who, you know, love cryptocurrency schemes [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=605.9200000000001s)]

*  American looks at this and thinks like, no, this is a, this is a great thing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=615.9200000000001s)]
*  Like no way. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=620.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=620.96s)]
*  I just don't understand. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=621.6s)]
*  Like everyone, like most normies know crypto at this point as like idiotic schemes that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=622.64s)]
*  consistently get people to lose their remainder of their disposable income when they take a [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=630.88s)]
*  shot in the dark. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=636.88s)]
*  Or maybe I'm wrong. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=638.4s)]
*  Maybe there's a lot more crypto bros out there. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=639.36s)]
*  Like the average person is like truly invested in crypto and is constantly doing pump and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=642.0s)]
*  dumps and getting pumped and dumped over and over again, thinking the next one is going [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=648.0s)]
*  to be good. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=652.24s)]
*  I don't know, but I feel like everything that I know about cryptocurrency is just that it's [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=652.96s)]
*  very, it's very much, it's very much just like a, you know, deregulated security that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=659.28s)]
*  people can actively cheat others out of their hard earned dollars on. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=668.72s)]
*  So for them to be like, it's lawfare. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=672.96s)]
*  They're coming after the cryptocurrency rug pullers. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=677.6800000000001s)]

*  trying to do the right thing for so many years. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  And oh, what like just like I forget how like crypto is also like a bunch of these guys [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=949.92s)]
*  like we're in scandal and we're all in fraud. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=955.8399999999999s)]
*  And they were, you know, like just a few years ago, they were persona non grata and [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=957.6s)]
*  we boys felt like circles. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=962.08s)]
*  But now they're should lead. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=963.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=965.2s)]
*  Well, it's because a retardio whale just bought 4000 of dog shit to at 383 million [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=966.64s)]
*  dollars. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=974.96s)]
*  MC. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=975.6s)]
*  And thanks for OK. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=976.8000000000001s)]
*  That's why. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=978.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=980.08s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=980.8000000000001s)]
*  Please. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=982.0s)]
*  I was just going to say. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=985.2s)]
*  Are those a vehicle? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=986.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying, man. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=987.28s)]
*  Oh, they were like they were like things like a huge time. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=988.4s)]
*  But now they're back because the US on the Internet and the US should win. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=992.64s)]
*  They're so handsome right out of central casting. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=997.1999999999999s)]
*  They're beautiful. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=999.36s)]
*  They're beautiful. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1000.0s)]
*  One but two of them individuals around this. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1000.64s)]
*  They like to row. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  We need to row anymore. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1004.8s)]
*  Do we use boats? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1006.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1006.8s)]
*  Isn't it beautiful to have not one but two of them folks? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  God made to just the iceberg. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1010.7199999999999s)]
*  I express my deep gratitude for the seriousness with which you're approaching our industry [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1013.28s)]
*  and how you're actually helping guide it in the right direction. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1019.68s)]
*  I've worked with many central banks and other countries. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1022.8s)]
*  And when I was working there, I was wondering why I, as an American citizen, can't help [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1024.96s)]
*  the United States financial system reach this higher level that the world is on course towards [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1028.72s)]
*  generally. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1034.24s)]
*  And so I'm very grateful that finally there's been a new level of kind of common sense and [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1035.2s)]
*  adoption of these ideas. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1040.3999999999999s)]
*  Me and the other people in this room do believe that the crypto blockchain Web 3 infrastructure [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1042.8000000000002s)]
*  is the next iteration of the financial system. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1047.92s)]
*  And I think that the US should have its leadership position continue in that new financial system. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1050.8000000000002s)]
*  And I'm very, very happy to see people like David Sacks, Secretary Besant, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1055.76s)]
*  Secretary Letnick taking this very seriously with their time and very grateful to them too. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1060.3200000000002s)]
*  So it is crazy. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1064.24s)]
*  I think that they're just overjoyed to see this. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1065.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think it is a big part of how the US can continue its role in the global [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1066.96s)]
*  financial system. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1071.92s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1072.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1073.2s)]
*  I mean, this is worse than every other thing though. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1075.28s)]
*  It's literally just, this is genuinely money and just like lighting it on fire. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1077.76s)]
*  This is, this is so much worse than like all the other things that they do. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1081.8400000000001s)]
*  Like this is unironically worse than like DEI equals die. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1084.72s)]
*  And the reason why it's worse is because they're just basically normalizing [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1088.3200000000002s)]
*  fucking people over. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1092.88s)]
*  Like they're, they're saying like, no, we're just going to keep doing rug pulls. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1094.48s)]
*  Like everything is done. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1097.52s)]
*  We're all dust. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1099.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1100.48s)]
*  America gone in the shitter in the pooper. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1100.88s)]
*  We're now actively. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1104.24s)]
*  But there is, okay, but there is, there is at least robber barons built the fucking [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1105.44s)]
*  railroads, man. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1110.4s)]
*  There are really historical parallel. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1111.44s)]
*  You can look at like, but like they at least built an example though. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1113.1200000000001s)]
*  So like in the, in the eighties, right? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1117.1200000000001s)]
*  Like there was this big bank failure crisis about the savings and loans. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1118.72s)]
*  And what happened was that like savings and loans were these mortgage banks. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1122.24s)]
*  And then they changed the rules and they effectively just became cash machines. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  They were laundries cook crooks took control of them. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1128.8s)]
*  But like the, but what that meant was that by the end of the eighties, they had to [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1132.24s)]
*  bail all these institutions out. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1136.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1138.0s)]
*  Like the thing is with this, like, yeah, they're trying to normalize stealing from [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1138.1599999999999s)]
*  people, whatever, but like you can't normalize like anti-gravity. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1141.2s)]
*  It's not real. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1144.8s)]
*  It's not a thing. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1145.52s)]
*  Like eventually like the number will go down. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1146.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1149.36s)]
*  It's over already. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1149.84s)]
*  But they, they, they have to like, there has to be an exit. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1150.48s)]
*  Like there will, you know. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1153.9199999999998s)]
*  But this is nothing. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1155.04s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1156.0s)]
*  Like, like scams have increasingly become like back in the day, you used to sell snake [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1156.8s)]
*  oil, which meant that there was a product, which meant that you were selling it like [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1162.56s)]
*  a, like a tangible product that people could hold in their hands and maybe have some sort [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  of like placebo effect. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1171.28s)]
*  There's like a postmodern quality to it. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1172.3999999999999s)]
*  Now it's like being scammed. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1174.6399999999999s)]
*  Now is just literally being like, this is a scam, but we're just product. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1176.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1180.72s)]
*  There's no product. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1181.6s)]
*  Where the product is like, they say it's like digital pogs. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1182.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1185.44s)]
*  But they also say it's a scam half the time. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1185.68s)]
*  It's literally just like, this is a scam, but other people can get in on it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1188.56s)]
*  But then you have to, like, again, you have to come back to it and be like, all right. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, then why do people put money in it if it is a scam and it's an acknowledged scam? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1195.8400000000001s)]
*  And it's because there is like this implicit thing where they say like, well, like the [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1199.28s)]
*  whole, like, like Nick, everything is a scam. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1203.28s)]
*  This is a scam that could at least have like the slight potential of making you money. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1206.72s)]
*  So like there's, that's why like there's, you know, the whole wink and nod quality to [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1211.1200000000001s)]
*  it. That's why like who are able to pull off rug pulls, but people who, you know, like [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1214.24s)]
*  think of like the biggest influencers who like play around in crypto and stuff and juicing [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1218.88s)]
*  things like Dave Portnoy, you know, like being careful, you know, I'll be careful about like [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1222.56s)]
*  saying what he does or exactly, but like somebody like him is able to be an influencer in this [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1226.88s)]
*  space because it's like they're able to do that wink and the nod because they're able [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1231.6s)]
*  to say like, yeah, this thing is like fucking crazy. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1235.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1237.36s)]
*  But embedded in that is like you could make a lot of fucking money because everything's [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1237.92s)]
*  unfair. And if you can't make money doing anything else, why not make money in this [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1241.68s)]
*  thing where you just click some buttons? You know, like that to me is the simplicity of it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  So was it someone in that room made 81 million from knowing which coins the U S would buy [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1248.8s)]
*  before the administrators announcement. That's amazing. Oh my God. The fucking ad blockers. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1254.3200000000002s)]
*  So shit now look the whale who shorted ETH with 50 X leverage now holds 81 million profit [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1259.76s)]
*  insider trading question mark. Now there is no such thing as insider trading any [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1266.16s)]
*  longer. Okay. Because when you have the treasury secretary come out and say, we've been doing too [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1271.52s)]
*  much lawfare. We've been waging war on these, these transactions, like people that are engaging in [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  crypto trading at a time when we need significantly more control over this sort of thing or just make [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1285.36s)]
*  it illegal in its entirety. That means there is no more insider trading suspicions at all. It doesn't [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1293.92s)]
*  matter. It's legal. It's just, it's completely legal. If they are openly stating that they are [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1300.4s)]
*  not going to regulate cryptocurrencies, they're actively saying that they're not going to regulate [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1306.24s)]
*  cryptocurrencies. And that means insider trading is not illegal, just like rug pulls are not illegal. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1310.5600000000002s)]
*  Okay. And they kind of weren't already. I mean, this though is where it's like, you know, they'll, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1318.0800000000002s)]
*  they may get out of, they may get away with it in the sense that like they make a ton of money, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1324.5600000000002s)]
*  they defrauded a ton of people, but there is an end. Like this stuff has like a sell by date. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1328.32s)]
*  And that's, that's not, that's just how all financial scams work. Even at the highest, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1333.9199999999998s)]
*  like weirdest level where you now have them, like the mark is just like a digital asset. Who's, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1339.28s)]
*  there's never been a demonstrated use value for it or whatever. Not even the promise of one at [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1346.0s)]
*  this point. Aside from also if your goal, if you're like a defy truth or okay. If you're a [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1350.56s)]
*  defy maximalist, then you should be very upset because all of this stuff undermines confidence [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1356.88s)]
*  in cryptocurrency in the, in the eyes of the average person. NFTs are another, were another [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1363.6000000000001s)]
*  major hit, I think to people treating any sort of cryptocurrency seriously, right? Like it just [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1369.5200000000002s)]
*  doesn't make any sense. Not that I don't even think that it's going to happen anyway. Like I [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1379.5200000000002s)]
*  don't think it's going to become like a, like the world currency or whatever. It's so stupid. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1384.48s)]
*  It also would literally ruin America. Why the fuck would you, if you're the United States of America, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  unless like Satoshi or whoever is actually an American agent or something, and they [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1397.3600000000001s)]
*  maintain the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin that they have, where they can do market manipulation. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1404.56s)]
*  The world currency currently is the dollar. Why would you, why would you change that reality? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1410.3200000000002s)]
*  And that dollar is still backed by American imperialism. The real confidence in the dollar [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1415.44s)]
*  is obviously not the gold standard because it doesn't exist anymore. But instead is the [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1420.24s)]
*  American might, the American military always, that can always maintain some level of confidence. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1425.44s)]
*  So you can always trade on the dollar. If they were to swap that out to cryptocurrency, that [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1432.16s)]
*  undermines American dominance of the global stage. It is yet another instance where Donald Trump is [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1438.16s)]
*  doing something that doesn't make any sense. Maybe he is JD pond on Satoshi camp because his BTC [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1442.8s)]
*  hasn't moved since he went missing. No, it does. All I'm saying is like the, the, the speculation [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1448.24s)]
*  of the guy that, who the real Satoshi is or whatever. The question that people have is maybe [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1454.0s)]
*  he's a intelligence asset or something. Maybe it is the American government that owns all the [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1460.96s)]
*  reserves. Otherwise it would make no sense for them to even move in the direction of cryptocurrency [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1466.64s)]
*  either. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO74lvU8anw&t=1471.3600000000001s)]
