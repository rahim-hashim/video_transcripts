# Streaming Has Ruined My Brain | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s)
*  Yeah, Hassan reading a book is a funny meme, I think. I don't read books anymore. I should. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=0.0s)]
*  I really should. I think about that a lot. I think about how much my brain has probably atrophied. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=6.32s)]
*  Not even probably, definitely atrophied. I read so much, but the things that I read are so stupid. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=14.64s)]
*  I'm reading chat. I'm reading articles. I'm reading Twitter. And all of those things combined are [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=20.8s)]
*  stupid. Anyway, personal news wise, this is a part of the broadcast where I tell you about what [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=30.48s)]
*  happened in my life. What happened in the world of a song house and I'll be piker in between the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=35.84s)]
*  time period where I press the stop streaming button, press the star shim and button. So help me God. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=38.8s)]
*  And I'm going to do that. Okay. Ended the broadcast yesterday after a quarter day, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=42.88s)]
*  basically a half day, maybe a quarter day, six hours. Who was this guy hung out with my mom [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=49.68s)]
*  and my brother. We watched virtually every episode of we watched virtually every episode [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=55.84s)]
*  of that show. The Seth Rogen show. I caught up to it. Finally the studio, fantastic, hilarious. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=63.28s)]
*  The Kool-Aid episode is so funny. Yeah. The Kool-Aid episode with ice cube is perhaps one [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=71.68s)]
*  of the funnier ones. Like it's just, it gets a little too much at times because of the track [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=79.68s)]
*  shots, the score. It gets a little too tense for my taste, but it's, it's definitely hilarious. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  It's not a spoiler thing. Okay. It's not a spoiler thing. I'm not revealing the jokes. It's also a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=95.92000000000002s)]
*  comedy. How can you spoil a comedy? Oh my God. There is no like, there's just tension through [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=101.92000000000002s)]
*  and through. That's it. Every part of it is so meta. It's really interesting because like [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=108.08s)]
*  Apple plus Apple TV very clearly wants to be a leader, a leader in this space, right? Apple TV [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=114.88s)]
*  wants to be the new HBO. It is dumping a lot of money into the arts side of the, as a streaming [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=126.32s)]
*  platform. And it wants to be a, it wants to be a leader in this space, right? It wants to be, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=135.52s)]
*  and they kind of are, they're doing a lot of good work, right? You got Severance, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=143.12s)]
*  you got a lot of shows like I've been watching murder bot, which is not that good, but whatever. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=147.36s)]
*  So I think like Apple TV is trying to become this new HBO, right? And in an effort to do so, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=152.72s)]
*  they're spending a lot of money on, on these works of art that are obviously, you know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=162.08s)]
*  not going to pan out initially and probably be seen as like major waste of funding, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  but that's what Hollywood is supposed to be at the end of the day. And so this show, I think is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  the most, the most like, look at what we're doing and look at how awesome what we're doing is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  type show of all time, because basically the studio is a show about Hollywood, about the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  changes that have taken place in Hollywood, especially with the introductions of, you know, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  optics, focus, social commentary, silly IP, silly IP restrictions, and specifically the streamers, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  the introduction of streamers. And, and it's, it's a, it's a little bit of a meta, it's a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=214.64s)]
*  meta commentary through and through because it actually is an Apple TV show, which is a streamer, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  ironically, that focuses on the story of a studio executive that has to juggle the interest, the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=230.48s)]
*  corporate interest in this new hedge fund backed Hollywood studio streamer funded environment [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=240.72s)]
*  that also simultaneously cares about art, about making art. And it's really good. It's really good. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=250.56s)]
*  I like it a lot. It's, it's called the studio. It's on Apple TV. It's fantastic. In any case, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=257.44s)]
*  I did watch the pit on HBO. It was also amazing. So, so do, do, do, I guess we have to put a new [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=263.12s)]
*  pin for Noah's a fundraiser, but I wish they made it more realistic. I mean, I think it's supposed [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=269.92s)]
*  to be a little bit ridiculous, right? So I really, I really like it. I personally really enjoyed it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=274.24s)]
*  I also watched a little bit of murder bot. Didn't like that as much. Every time I enter here, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  you yapping about some chill. I mean, that's what I do, man. I'm I'm I got the gift of yap, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  the gift of gab. I'm a, I'm a grade a yapper gay. You sexualize that old man for 45,806, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=294.32s)]
*  seven minutes. Have you considered therapy? What about the last of us season two true and on had [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=303.92s)]
*  John early on, he had some crazy percentage of households that Apple TV only in basically no one [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  has it law. Yeah. Have you read the murder brought Brooks? They're great. No, I have not, but yeah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=314.0s)]
*  So that's what I watched. I watched murder bot. I watched a little bit more of and, or, and, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=321.68s)]
*  or is a slow burn for me. And you know, I'm catching up. I'm catching up with all of my shows. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  That's why this is good. It's good. I get to catch up with my shows when I end my stream early. And [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  then I yeah, Hassan reading a book is a, is a funny meme. I think I don't read books anymore. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=338.88s)]
*  I should, I really should. I think about that a lot. I, I think about how much my brain has [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=345.92s)]
*  probably at your feed, not even probably definitely at your feed. I read so much, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=353.6s)]
*  but the things that I read are so stupid. I'm reading chat. I'm reading articles. I'm reading [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=358.8s)]
*  Twitter and all of those things combined are not actually reading. They're not, they're not [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=364.48s)]
*  helping me learn at least. And no audio books are not the same. I've never been an audio book guy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=371.36s)]
*  I'm a podcast guy for sure, but I don't know what it is. I just, I don't know what it is, but I will [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=377.2s)]
*  say it's for me. I have to read like a normal paperback book. I don't even with hard cover. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=384.56s)]
*  It needs to be a paperback book. Otherwise it doesn't enter my brain. I genuinely don't know [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=393.44s)]
*  what it is. I can't do Kindle. Okay. Maybe one day, maybe one day I'll get used to Kindle. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=399.68s)]
*  Okay. Sometimes I'll like see someone using a Kindle. I'm like, let me, let me take a peek [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=406.56s)]
*  at that. Let me take a gander. I don't know what it is though. I need it. It can't be audio book. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=410.48s)]
*  It can't be a kindle. It has to literally be a paperback book. If it's not a paperback book, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=416.32s)]
*  it doesn't enter my brain. And I think it's because I am old. I will admit that I'm old. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=422.48s)]
*  I'm an old man. I don't even like hard cover. And the worst part is many books when they first come [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=428.08s)]
*  out in circulation, they only send you hard. They only send you the hardcover shit for the first [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=433.2s)]
*  year. The first edition of most books is hardcover. And it's like, bro, you are literally adding an [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=441.12s)]
*  extra two pounds to the book for no reason. Okay. Maybe it's good for profits or something, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=448.08s)]
*  but I don't understand it. Like the whole point is it's a fucking book. It's supposed to be mobile. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=454.64s)]
*  When you make it hardcover, it's no longer mobile. You can't even like when push comes to shove, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=459.36s)]
*  fit it in your pocket, for example. You know what I mean? There's no, you are destroying the mobility [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=464.56s)]
*  of this medium that is incredibly mobile. It doesn't make any sense. Hardcovers are meant [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=470.24s)]
*  to protect the book and they last 10x longer. I don't care. I don't with it because like [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=476.4s)]
*  hardcover books, when you're reading, you can't bend. Okay. There is no, there is no taking it [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=481.52s)]
*  and one-handing it, for example, softcover books. You can one-hand it. You can flip the cover to the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=487.68s)]
*  back and hold it like this, no matter how thick it is. Well, you can't do that with hardcover. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=494.0s)]
*  It's just, it's just not good. It just looks nicer on a shelf and that's it. I think it's the biggest [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=498.08s)]
*  scheme of all time. Not that it matters. There's like 11 people that still know how to read a book. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=502.0s)]
*  So who gives a shit? And I certainly have not read a book. Like I, when I was traveling, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=507.04s)]
*  I was going back through the Alexander cookbook on Mao, like the, it's like, I think it's Alexander [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=512.24s)]
*  cook on, on like the red book, but it's not actually the red book. It's like a collection of [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=522.08s)]
*  it's a mouse little red book, a global history. And it's just like Mao cookbook. No, no, it's just, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  it's not even it's it's technically it's like a, it's like a college. It's a college curriculum [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=534.88s)]
*  book. It's not even like a, like a, I guess it's not technically for a fun read, but, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=541.6s)]
*  but again, like I, I, it takes a while for me to, it takes a while for me to like dive into shit [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=546.96s)]
*  to read on flights. Damn, that book is expensive as fuck. Yeah. I mean, it's a, it's, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=553.76s)]
*  I don't think he's that, I don't know. Is it no paper bags, like $25. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=559.12s)]
*  I feel like flights are one of those times that are perfect to read. Cause you don't have anything [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=565.6s)]
*  else to do. I agree. Yeah. I got the bill Burk clip. Anyway, what the fuck was I talking about? Oh [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=568.32s)]
*  yeah. Personal news wise this morning I woke up, I took a Kaya and a Fifi who's also here, both of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=573.28s)]
*  my ladies to the, to the park with my mom. And then I played basketball and you know, I only had [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=581.6s)]
*  like two full court pickup basketball games in me timeline wise, because I'm just a, I'm just an old [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=589.68s)]
*  man who is having a hard time getting back into it. But Hey, at least on the weight front, I'm down [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=596.8s)]
*  to two 35. So that's good. I'm just like ripping through it to the best of my ability. I do, I do [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=604.4s)]
*  have moments where the hunger kicks in, especially at night has song going to be as at the dream [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=612.64s)]
*  con B ball turning no training. No, I am training. Shut up. I'm training. I'm training specifically [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=616.4s)]
*  so that I can get better. Okay. I came into the hard cover slander. This is the most offensive [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=621.6s)]
*  take you've had. Soft cover is nice for space, but I don't know. There's something special about the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=626.24s)]
*  hard cover. I don't agree. I think hard covers are ass, but yeah, where was I? All right. So yeah, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=629.36s)]
*  that's it. That's it. That's all I got. Gym stream. When a gym shoes are boring, dude, you guys don't [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=634.64s)]
*  like it. You say you do, but you don't actually want it. Book I would recommend is Nathan J. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=640.24s)]
*  Robinson's new book, which is basically a summary of all of Chomsky's works. Very good. Howard level [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=645.6s)]
*  type beat. Didn't, didn't he write it with no I'm chomsky. The myth of American idealism, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=650.72s)]
*  how us foreign policy in danger is the world. No, I'm chomsky and Nathan J. Robinson. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=656.08s)]
*  Yeah. Have you tried book stacking? I'll turn alternate reading short fiction book, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=661.76s)]
*  heavy nonfiction book at the same time. If you get bored with one book, just switch the other. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=665.44s)]
*  No. Also I don't have like, I don't have too much time. I don't have too much time to fucking [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=668.64s)]
*  to, to read books to begin with. Like I just, I never have time. It sucks. All right. Anyway, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE86ud4L2-s&t=674.08s)]
