# Charlie Kirk On Democrats' 2024 Defeat | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g)
*  is that the only way that that the uniparty hacks can fund is by open borders. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=0.0s)]
*  What are you saying? Uniparty hacks? Your president is the number one uniparty hack. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=8.64s)]
*  He's putting Marco Rubio in charge of the f**king state department. Like what are you talking about? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=15.92s)]
*  These guys living on alternative plane of existence. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=21.36s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, here's, let's get started with Charlie Kirk pouring honey on another goat, uncle [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=24.0s)]
*  shaky Gerger. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=38.4s)]
*  Listen to the young Turks. The young Turks had it right. They should have went full economic [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=39.36s)]
*  populist and they should have promised UBI universal basic income. They should have went [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  full anti-billionaire class. They should also said, you know what? Donald Trump is right at [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=47.36s)]
*  immigration, but these are the things wrong with it. They should have went full socialist [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=52.32s)]
*  nationalist, you know, bro went bro and they should have went full socialist nationalist, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=57.2s)]
*  which is wild. Okay. On the one hand, he's recognizing that like left-wing economic sentiment [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=63.04s)]
*  is popular, but also simultaneously, he just said like the Democrats need to go full. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=69.68s)]
*  I was waiting for you to go live peach babe too. I'm here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=75.6s)]
*  Peach babe too. That's a crazy f**king thing to just openly say. Yeah. He should have gone full [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  socialist nationalist, you know, or maybe some people might call that national socialist, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=86.24s)]
*  just a little national socialism. What's wrong? That's never been tried before social security. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=92.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? No, like expand social security, universal basic income. They should like, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=99.36s)]
*  that would have been dangerous for us to run against. Instead. Again, I've been saying, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=103.12s)]
*  it's that they got no, we talked about this on popular Biden though. I'm sorry. All you have to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=107.36s)]
*  do is like, look at Denmark. Denmark is a country. Their left-wing party has been in power forever. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  All you all they had to do is bite the bullet and say, okay, we're doing an immigration pause. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  Just pause immigration. And suddenly you can get away with so much more social democratic stuff, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=126.0s)]
*  but here's single payer, all of that. You just, yeah, totally. Yeah. The one thing that was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=132.08s)]
*  stopping Americans from doing socialism was the, the immigration. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Any day [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  now chat any day now we're going to have, we're going to have bountiful social democracy. Any [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=146.08s)]
*  moment now, dude, it's, it's slated to happen. Trust trust, dude. Trust these people have f**king, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=152.4s)]
*  I mean, they don't believe what they're saying either. Honestly, the only part that is important [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=161.2s)]
*  about this commentary that I think holds weight is that they also recognize, they also personally [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=166.48s)]
*  recognize the dangers of left-wing economic populism. That's the only thing you should take [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=173.6s)]
*  seriously. That's it. They know how hard it is to go up against left-wing economic populism, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  a resounding message that hyper focuses on people's material realities and addresses them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=184.56s)]
*  And, you know, personally has real actionable solutions that will make people's lives better. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=193.12s)]
*  There is no counter to that from the Republican party, but luckily enough for the Republican party, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=200.16s)]
*  they don't ever have to counter that because the Democrats are not interested in that whatsoever. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=205.84s)]
*  Yeah. Better example, new deal era Democrats held the U S house for more than 60 years, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=210.56s)]
*  mid thirties to the mid nineties, the Avi on Theo's podcast. Oh yeah. This was fantastic [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=215.28s)]
*  conversation. I want to go on a Theo Vance podcast as well. I think it'd be, it'd be a cool, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=221.76s)]
*  back and forth. I have heard some sussy shift from him a little bit, but you know, I've heard some [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=228.56s)]
*  sussy shift from him, but overall I think it's, it's good to, it's good to speak to someone like [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=233.44s)]
*  that. I think he's overall very open-minded the bullet and say, it's okay to restrict immigration [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=238.64s)]
*  and not naked this deranged priority to replace the citizens of your own country and gloat about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=245.04s)]
*  it and how you're like getting a better group of people in. If you don't do that, you can win [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=251.92s)]
*  elections. But Blake, the young Turks had it figured out just one sec. I'm telling you chink [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  and Ana Kasparian. They were nice having my show. They like, they saw it. And I was like, geez, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=260.64s)]
*  if they run that campaign, that's dangerous. I hope this gets clipped up and sent to them [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=265.04s)]
*  because they were completely ignored by the Democrat party, like completely ignored. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh, they were put in that corner. And they were the only ones that understood. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=272.24s)]
*  You would not be beating the anti-Semite allegations. If you went on that pod brother. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=275.44s)]
*  No, I think that that first of all, Gabor Monte has been on that podcast, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=279.44s)]
*  Bernie Sanders and Gabor Monte. So that's crazy. Like I can't like that is, that is why it is such [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=284.24s)]
*  a wild situation that that man went from talking to Gabor Monte to being like, yeah, I don't really [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=294.16s)]
*  understand. It means like lifting left, left wing Jews are controlling the media to do it. I don't [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=300.24s)]
*  know how the f**k, how the f**k do you do that? How do you like, there is not any time lost in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=305.6s)]
*  between that process. Like that s**t is kind of alarming, but in any case, it's bizarre as hell [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=313.44000000000005s)]
*  because Charlie Kirk's political instincts are cheeks. No, I think these guys understand that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=320.24s)]
*  left-wing economic populism is resilient and strong and popular and would be a real fight [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  that they would have to go up against. But Republicans are so lucky that they never have [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=331.92s)]
*  to fight against that. And then they can always fight on their own terms by constantly making a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=337.92s)]
*  big fuss about hyper-specific marginalized populations that have no f**k, no counter [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=344.16s)]
*  messaging platform and no strategy to advocate for their humanity. Okay. It's fantastic. Democrats [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=352.24s)]
*  never give them something to fight against because Democrats don't fight for anything. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  That's it. Like on the simplest term, if you don't want to think about the underlying [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=364.48s)]
*  material harm and what the Democrats must do to go against their own corporate benefactors, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  to solve some of these systemic issues, if you don't want to talk about policy like that, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=377.92s)]
*  think about it in the simplest terms possible. If the Democrats give something to the Republicans [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=382.8s)]
*  to fight against, if the Democrats don't do that, because Democrats themselves are also reactionary, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=388.48s)]
*  so they end up getting dominated by the Republicans. They end up getting dominated [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=394.96s)]
*  by the Republicans over and over again. Didn't work for abortion though. Is this really different [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=400.32s)]
*  brother? What are you talking about? The abortion is exactly the abortion issue is exactly what I'm [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=404.08s)]
*  talking about. The Republicans undermine civil liberties for Americans across the board. 50% [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=408.0s)]
*  of Americans lost their opportunity to be able to get this medical procedure done. Right. They [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=415.44s)]
*  removed from entire chunks of the population, especially in red states, women's bodily autonomy. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=423.68s)]
*  Right. They took that away. And then liberals came up after that and tried to, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  tried to, you know, fundraise off of that. That's another example of the, the Republicans pushing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=434.56s)]
*  the boundaries, pushing the political conversation, pushing people's understanding of, of American [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=439.92s)]
*  politics further and further into the right. Democrats played catch up in that situation. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=445.68s)]
*  If they actually had a solution for it, they would have actively whipped the votes and instilled a [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  moral panic towards abortion. A long time ago, they would have utilized the bully pulpit and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=456.08s)]
*  would have gotten enough assurances. Okay. And they would have turned around. They would have [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=463.68s)]
*  turned around and they would have secured the, the people's right to get a, the people's right to get [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=470.0s)]
*  medical coverage. Anyway, what is this? Daniel Dan Saltman mentioned in a P Diddy article rumors [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=478.64s)]
*  swirled that Diddy and Ashton Kutcher use tiny chat to flirt with underage girls. The celebs [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=484.56s)]
*  helped tiny chat raise 1.5 million before Diddy's September, 2024 arrest. What? In addition to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=489.2s)]
*  acknowledging the actors, Mike covered this in September, 2024, Sean Diddy comes with arrested [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=494.72s)]
*  following a string of sexual assault and domestic abuse allegations. In addition to acknowledging [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=499.92s)]
*  the actor's ties, the men who allegedly engaged in predatory behavior, the celebs joined involvement [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=503.6s)]
*  in tiny chat is also being called into question. A tick tock account claimed Kutcher, Ashton Kutcher [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=507.52s)]
*  and Sean Diddy comes invested in the platform to chat with underage girls freely. I mean, this is [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=512.72s)]
*  distract the fly. I don't know how valid this is. Did he and Ashton Kutcher have been accused of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=517.12s)]
*  flirting with teenage girls on tiny chat in 2011 Kutcher and combs were two of tiny chats, earliest [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=521.12s)]
*  investors per his business profile. The company was founded by Cole Turner, Martin Redmond, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  and Daniel Saltman. Damn destiny's podcast cohost and Mr. Adpocalypse is definitely happening. I [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=532.0s)]
*  promise you. Why don't you guys understand? Look at how many times we've posted on LSF [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=540.24s)]
*  and Michael Stoner current and tech crunch, combs and Kutcher, Kutcher helped other investors, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=544.72s)]
*  including Madonna's former manager, Guy Ozier, he raised 1.5 million to get the video chat service [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=549.2s)]
*  comparable to chat roulette off the ground. The site was first tested in 2009 and included live [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=553.68s)]
*  chat rooms. However, according to September 27, 2024, tick-tock user for I'm not famous anymore. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=558.4s)]
*  They use the account for sinister reasons. They account the claim to celebs often flirt with [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=563.04s)]
*  teenage girls. I mean, this is not a valid evidence. I don't think there's a lot of, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=567.04s)]
*  you got a pretty smile for a girl with those dimples. Combs tells the fan in the clip. Wait, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=571.92s)]
*  what? Come on. This is a different guy. Wait, no, no, no. Dan Saltman, the same Dan Saltman [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=575.84s)]
*  that has been doing the Twitch adpocalypse shit is the guy who is the owner of tiny chat. I think [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=581.6s)]
*  it's the same guy. Isn't it? Yeah. No, he did make no Dan can stream. Dan Saltman is the guy who made [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=587.76s)]
*  tiny chat. That's correct. What does this got any plans? December 8th. What does that mean? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=594.4s)]
*  Why so ominous? When people say stuff like that, I just don't understand. Like what, what, what, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  what are you going to kill me? That's the lookalike contest thing. Oh, okay. Okay. No, I do have plans [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=603.84s)]
*  that day. Yeah, no, he, he owns this. He owns tiny chat. It was like, he is definitely his. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=610.4s)]
*  That part is not shocking. And the fact that Diddy was, you know, was fundraising for it alongside [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=616.64s)]
*  Ashton Kutcher. That's also not that shocking. Rich people can invest in a whole bunch of stuff. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=624.48s)]
*  The part of this that makes it weird. The part of this that would make it weird is if Diddy was [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=630.56s)]
*  actually using the website to talk to miners. But even then there's no assurances that Dan [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=635.2s)]
*  Saltman personally knew that, that Diddy was using it to do such a thing. So I, unlike, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=642.88s)]

*  attack everyone in my orbit regularly, I'm not going to participate in that sort of thing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=659.52s)]
*  So despite the fact that, despite the fact that yes, Dan Saltman does own tiny chatter, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=666.16s)]
*  did own tiny chat and fundraise off of Ashton Kutcher and Diddy. I don't know if, you know, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=672.08s)]
*  he knew the extent of how much Diddy was using it. It's not a good look, but you know, until [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=677.6s)]
*  there's more, until there's more evidence, I will hold off on, you know, jumping on this bandwagon. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=683.84s)]
*  He has a whole long list of other shit you can criticize to do for no need to go into [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=691.12s)]
*  conspiracy shit. I mean, tiny chat is a weird website. I don't really know enough about [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=694.4000000000001s)]
*  tiny chat to be very honest with you. Yeah. So, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=700.24s)]
*  all right. Where was I? Oh, we were talking about Charlie Kirk giving props to unk. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  Dan Saltman Do it like you could have expanded the Democrat base. That would have been so scary to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=714.8s)]
*  run against. If they would have run on like legalization of weed, universal basic income, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=718.4s)]
*  strict immigration. I'm serious. Strict immigration, ending the wars like the old [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=722.48s)]
*  Bernie Sanders portfolio. Yeah. Instead, Kamala went for the cheap corporate cash. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=726.88s)]
*  Because everyone said you need to finance your campaign against Trump. And well, here's the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=732.24s)]
*  reason why that Charlie and I think we figured this out is that the only way that that the [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=735.6s)]
*  uniparty hacks can fund war is by open borders. What are you saying uniparty hacks, bitch? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=742.56s)]
*  Your president is the number one uniparty hack. He's putting Marco Rubio in charge of the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=752.16s)]
*  f**king state department. Like, what are you talking about? These guys living on alternative [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=758.48s)]
*  plane of existence. They like fantasize that Donald Trump is actually this secretly based [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  anti-war guy. And then they act like they're all shocked and shit when he's not. I guess, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=768.8s)]
*  I guess it doesn't really matter. Like they don't really care. They like the war. That's [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=774.88s)]
*  the wars that, that Donald Trump also facilitates participates in. And, and yeah, I don't know. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=780.72s)]
*  They just act like they act like it's a real and real nuisance. Oh man. I am really upset. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=789.0400000000001s)]
*  I am really personally upset that Donald Trump is continuing the wars, but like, I don't think he [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=798.0s)]
*  gives a s**t. New leftist British meta drop. Check out Jimmy the giant's video about the UK [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=802.64s)]
*  rights on YouTube. Right-wing and turned left is who seems to be on the exact same page as you. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=806.96s)]
*  Incredible video. Maybe we'll look at it later. It's very clear. They have to be able to fund the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=811.12s)]
*  entire enterprise of war through this or they're tied together lockstep at the hip. They have to [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=817.52s)]
*  do all of that. And that's what's being exposed right now is that you have all these people who [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=825.2800000000001s)]
*  have committed themselves to war and they've committed themselves to China and cheap labor. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=829.2s)]
*  And so open borders, China and big is, is, is them. That's them. And this is what Donald Trump has [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=835.52s)]
*  exposed. This is what this entire movement has exposed. And it's the most critical time that it [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=842.88s)]
*  could possibly ever happen because if we had not won, who knows what would happen? We would have [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=849.28s)]
*  been in world war three, you know, subservient to China for the rest of our lives. And we wouldn't [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=853.04s)]
*  have a culture here at all. There would be no American culture. It would be completely overrun. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  All that sticks, takes us, takes a step back and we'd be able to move forward and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=862.96s)]
*  continue to create an American culture. That's, that's important to the future of the country. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=867.5200000000001s)]
*  Okay. The last part of this was just like psychotic hallucinations. The only important, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=871.2s)]
*  the only important takeaway from this is that Charlie Kirk and others within the Republican [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=877.84s)]
*  commentary field understand, understand the, the value of left-wing economic populism. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=884.16s)]
*  And when Republicans or when Democrats themselves do not value that and, and fill the space with [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=892.4s)]
*  any sort of serious commentary or, or any sort of like reasonable policy prescriptions, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=899.28s)]
*  ultimately the Republicans can lie about it. Yeah. The one side, Jimmy, the giant bit, he thinks [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=906.64s)]
*  diesel leftism praises him. I mean, everyone has their own journey of de-radicalization for, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=910.88s)]
*  for looking at destiny as a successful person that pulled them away from like right-wing [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=915.6s)]
*  radicalization. You never know how much these people ride or die for these content creators. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=920.72s)]
*  Think about like, think about the average person who knows who the I am, for example, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  they don't know everything about me. They don't know what my, my entire scope, you know, or my [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=932.64s)]
*  entire worldview looks like. But regardless, do you, did you ever see yourself slipping down [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=938.0s)]
*  a radicalization path? Certainly. Yes, I am a young, I was a young man at a certain point. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=942.24s)]
*  People truly, that is like prime for radicalization. Speaking of young men, or I guess older men now, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=955.6s)]
*  uncle, uncle shaky Gergo. Okay. Chuck Weigert is in the crosshairs of Emma big land friend of the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=964.56s)]
*  show. Emma big land, because he said, I asked the alarm, must have put me in charge of cutting the [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=971.28s)]
*  Pentagon. And he said, what are your suggestions? I run the largest left-wing network online. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=974.88s)]
*  And democratic leaders have never asked me that question. The idea that they would take advice [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=978.88s)]
*  around populace is disdainful to them. Now, which side seems to be more open and inclusive, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=983.28s)]
*  which side seems more welcoming and which side tries really hard to drive you away. If you [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=988.7199999999999s)]
*  disagree even a little with orthodoxy, which side is asking for suggestions and which one is demanding [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=992.48s)]
*  compliance and obedience autism capital says your pivot has been fascinating to watch. Yeah. Twitter [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=996.8000000000001s)]
*  algorithm loves this shit. Look at this 52,000 likes dude. Why is your uncle acting brand new? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1002.4s)]
*  I don't know. I have no, I don't even for a second believe that any Republican will ever do something [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1009.12s)]
*  that is good. Okay. I just don't, I don't believe it. Like with the, with the exception of like Thomas [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1018.4s)]
*  Massey, and I don't even know the full scope of his, you know, sentiment and commentary. It's just [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1025.28s)]
*  like on the issue of Palestine, he seems to be pretty solid, but like, I just don't outside of [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1031.52s)]
*  like certain pet projects. I just don't think that the Republican party is, is even remotely interested [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1037.68s)]
*  in, in doing right by the American population. Like they are very good at identifying things [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1042.88s)]
*  that the broader American electorate care about. And they're very good at filling the space when [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1050.8000000000002s)]
*  Democrats refuse to personally push for it. Right. That is the unfortunate reality of the [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1057.7600000000002s)]
*  Democratic party is that they refuse. They refuse to do anything about it. I've never heard a Democrat [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1064.96s)]
*  be like, man, what do we got to do about this military budget? It's something that virtually [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1071.92s)]
*  every American that has heard about it is shocked by. There's a couple of things that genuinely [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1077.1200000000001s)]
*  confuse people. Okay. If you want to break the brains of the most normal, like the most [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1081.92s)]
*  politically normie guy, you can tell them two things. One, 32 States have made it illegal to [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1087.3600000000001s)]
*  protest peacefully against the state of Israel. You cannot boycott the state of Israel. You cannot [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1093.8400000000001s)]
*  demand sanctions for the state of Israel. And you cannot engage in any sort of divestment [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1098.4s)]
*  initiatives from the state of Israel. You will lose your job. If you do so, you have to sign a [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1103.76s)]
*  petition in place like in the state of Texas to be able to get a job in even a public school. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1108.3200000000002s)]
*  That breaks every normies mind. They're like, what? I thought America was a free speech safe haven. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1114.16s)]
*  What are you talking about? Okay. Another thing that breaks people's minds, if you want to break [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1118.48s)]
*  a political normies minds, tell them about the fact that the Pentagon has like trillions of dollars, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1123.52s)]
*  trillions of dollars that no one knows where it went. Okay. Trillions of dollars just missing. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1130.48s)]
*  They will straight up be like, what are you saying? Failed seven audits in a row. When you openly say [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1137.68s)]
*  that they're like, oh my God, what the fuck? What are you talking about? How many trillions has the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1143.44s)]
*  Pentagon not accounted for Pentagon from responsible statecraft.com. This is back in 2023. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1151.6s)]
*  Pentagon cannot account for 63% of the nearly $4 trillion in assets. The DOD regularly buys parts [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1159.84s)]
*  and equipment. It doesn't mean because it can't keep track of the parts and equipment it already [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  owns. It sounds like a conspiracy theory to be honest. I know it's not, but to a normie, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1170.32s)]
*  I think it comes across like a conspiracy theory, but it's not. I mean here. And if you want to [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1173.92s)]
*  understand like the way that the democratic party operates here is fucking a, here's the leading [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1177.84s)]
*  progressive mainstream political commentator, John Stewart, a comedian asking this exact same question. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1186.24s)]
*  Here's what the response is. Waste, fraud and abuse within a system. Audits and waste, fraud [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1192.8799999999999s)]
*  and abuse are not the same thing. So let's decompose these please educate me on. Sure. So an audit is [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1197.76s)]
*  exactly what you just described, which is, do I know what was delivered to which place? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1203.92s)]
*  Right. The ability to pass an audit or in the fact that the DOD has not passed on it is not [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1208.72s)]
*  suggestive of waste, fraud and abuse. That is completely false right there. So, so what is now [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1213.68s)]
*  is the question of it's suggestive that we can't, we don't bro. Can you imagine saying that to the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1220.16s)]
*  IRS like, Hey, excuse me, excuse me. Federal agent of the IRS overseeing my case. The fact [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1226.0s)]
*  that I cannot pass this audit that you have suggested does not mean that there is financial [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1235.76s)]
*  abuse or waste or fraud happening. You running ads again. My blocker is causing your stream to freeze. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1242.24s)]
*  No, I'm not. I'm fully funded entirely by the, you guys who subscribed to me [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1248.32s)]
*  back in the day, you used to subscribe to avoid the ads. Now I don't run ads and you still subscribe [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1256.72s)]
*  because you want to support the show, but that is who funds this broadcast for $6 or for free [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1262.4s)]
*  with a Twitch prime. Thank you. Austin seven three seven four eight two eight two seven four for the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1269.52s)]

*  Thank you. Pre-o 97 for the five give the subs and drew says for the five get the subs as well. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1279.44s)]
*  And look, thank you. Flucky and Bob or not have an accurate inventory that we can pull up of what we [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1285.2s)]
*  have where that is not the same as saying we can't do that because waste fraud and abuse has occurred. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1292.96s)]
*  So in my world, yeah, that's waste. How is that waste? If I give you a billion dollars and you [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1298.96s)]
*  can't tell me what happened to it, that to me is wasteful. That that means you are not [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1306.88s)]
*  responsible, but if you can't tell me where it went, then what am I supposed to think? And when [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1312.48s)]
*  there has been reporting, I mean, this is not like I'm not I'm not saying this is on you and that you [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1318.88s)]
*  cause this, but I think it's it's a tough argument to make that an 850 billion dollars. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1325.36s)]
*  You'll see to an organization that can't pass and a moon landing. The reason why I'm ignoring you, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1332.8799999999999s)]
*  despite the fact that you gifted five gift to subs is because the moon landing did not happen. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1339.6799999999998s)]

*  to me. Drone strike incoming. Okay. The dismissiveness of the deputy defense secretary, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1503.84s)]
*  Kathleen Hicks. And this clip is simply astounding. John Stewart points out the [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1510.32s)]
*  Pentagon keeps failing its audits and she tries to laugh it off. This is the entrenched mentality. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1512.8s)]

*  this is a fantastic conversation to be having because it's like, you're basically undermining [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1536.0s)]
*  the concept behind why audits exist. To begin with, you are just directly tackling the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1541.2s)]
*  conversation on, on semantics by saying, why should there even be an audit? What are audits [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1546.8s)]
*  really? Who cares about numbers? Now, having said that, while this is a real issue, do I believe [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1553.92s)]
*  that now the department of government efficiency is going to fix it? Fuck no. Elon Musk, a defense [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1560.32s)]

*  willing to be completely wrong on this. I am excited at the prospect of being entirely wrong [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1570.0s)]
*  on this prediction, but it's the same principle behind RFK junior. They will advocate for good [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1575.68s)]
*  things and never do the good things. They will advocate for good things, but their solution is [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1580.88s)]
*  bad. Okay. RFK junior says we have a health crisis in the way that we consume our food. He's right [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1585.84s)]
*  about that, but his solution is going to be putting a nuke on the FDA. The regulation is not the [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1591.52s)]
*  solution. Moral regulation and correct regulation, adequate regulation is the solution to this [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1598.72s)]
*  problem. Okay. This is why I don't even trust the Democrats, but you will never catch me trusting [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1605.04s)]
*  the Republicans. This is a big mistake that a lot of people who are regular critiques, critique [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1610.88s)]
*  critics. What the fuck's wrong with me today? Regular critics of the Democratic party oftentimes [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1617.68s)]
*  end up losing their skepticism of the Republican party. And it's dumb. It's dumb as fuck. If I'm [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1624.0s)]
*  skeptical of the Democrats and don't believe the Democrats, why the fuck would I ever believe the [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1634.0s)]
*  Republicans? The reason why I'm skeptical of Democrats is because of their closeness to the [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1637.84s)]
*  Republic. This is something that I was very frustrated with when Glenn Greenwald would advocate [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1641.52s)]
*  for these positions early on before he went full tilt, right? Before he went full tilt right wing. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1646.32s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald used to do this all the time. He would literally just like consistently hammer [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1651.84s)]
*  the Democrats. But then when it came to the Republican party, he never had that same smoke [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1656.72s)]
*  for them. And it blew my fucking mind. I was like, dude, what are you talking about? Like if you are [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1661.6s)]
*  angry at the Democrats, you should be unimaginably angry at the Republicans. What are we doing? So [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1666.8799999999999s)]
*  make no mistake. I hate to see onk fall for this. Okay. But you have to remember if you are critical [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1673.76s)]
*  of the Democratic party, but then you find yourself believing some of the things that [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1681.04s)]
*  the Republicans are stating, I don't know. It's like Bernie Sanders. He's talking about working [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1686.1599999999999s)]

*  That's crazy. I think this comes from a place of the Democratic party legitimately pushing away [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1707.28s)]
*  people in its own base over and over and over again. That's it. That's what is happening here. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1713.12s)]
*  Okay. That's what happened in Dearborn. That's what happened with all the young men that went [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1719.76s)]

*  deliberate mechanism pushing everybody away. It's called the Democratic party. And they're [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1730.96s)]
*  doing that because they don't want to win with these coalitions. They want to win on their own [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1736.24s)]
*  terms. And if they lose, it doesn't matter because that's going to yield a bountiful [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1740.4s)]
*  fundraising opportunity for them. All of the awfulness that the Republican party will subject [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1745.52s)]
*  the American population to is once again, in the simplest terms, a fantastic revenue opportunity. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1750.32s)]
*  When I became a Democrat, I was more, it was the more tolerant party. Republicans were [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1758.64s)]

*  coming from where they're so primed so conditioned into thinking, oh, you're a naysayer. You fucking [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=1998.88s)]
*  hate you hate the Democrats. You're not a Democrat. You must be a Republican. That's what they say. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2003.44s)]
*  And it's stupid. But the the most outspoken parts of the Democratic Party's base of support [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2011.3600000000001s)]
*  have basically adopted this position, this framework, they do it, they do it in my chat, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2018.48s)]
*  they do it on TikTok. I used to make fun of them all the time. I would ask them, show me your pay [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2023.0400000000002s)]
*  stubs. Is the DNC paying you? I have DNC operatives in my community. I talk to them. I debate with [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2027.76s)]
*  them. They openly will recognize that I'm right when you know, history absolves me of the sin of [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2034.56s)]
*  criticizing the Democratic Party. Where are your pay stubs? For many, they simply jump on this [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2042.16s)]
*  talking point without really examining it. Because that's what they've heard from mainstream outlets. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2050.08s)]
*  That's the mainstream outlets that are pumping this narrative over and over again. And people have [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2056.48s)]
*  no way to to deal with the issue. They have no way of examining or interrogating what's wrong with [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2062.32s)]
*  this sentiment. And they just kind of go along with it without thinking about it. And it's wrong. Do [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2067.2000000000003s)]
*  you not get behind Democrat policies that you like? I do. Of course I do. And I defend it. The [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2071.92s)]
*  Republicans are more reasonable at this point. Trump's economic policy is going to be better [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2076.4s)]
*  for America. And that's better for everyone. Yeah, you're totally right. Mass deportation [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2080.7200000000003s)]
*  of 20 million people that are participating in the American economy in very meaningful ways will [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2085.04s)]
*  certainly be better. Or tariffs being slapped on all consumer goods coming in from China with no [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2089.84s)]
*  adequate domestic manufacturing substitute will certainly also be inflationary. But that'll be [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2095.7599999999998s)]
*  good for the economy as well. No. And before people say you're a racist monster to this chatter, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2101.84s)]
*  no, this chatter in many ways is no different than the fucking average liberal who will defend the [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2108.32s)]
*  Democratic Party without ever questioning it. The average liberal that says like, oh, you don't [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2114.8799999999997s)]
*  understand. Gaza is going to be so much worse under Donald Trump. It's like, bro, you are [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2118.64s)]
*  the people that you're advocating for are currently pummeling Gaza. What are you talking about? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2123.2799999999997s)]
*  A lot of people simply just repeat shit without thinking about it. And this is something that [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2127.04s)]
*  many people don't understand. Trump top tabs, Dr. Mehmet, those two service centers for Medicare [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2131.52s)]
*  and Medicaid services administrator. Oh my God, we got a Turkish goat in the building. We got a [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2136.3199999999997s)]
*  Turkish goat in the building. Oh my God. Okay. Dude, dude, dude, put them in charge of Pennsylvania, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2140.56s)]
*  dude. Okay. Look, I don't like Mehmet does. Okay. I don't like Mehmet does as at all, as you guys [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2147.12s)]
*  know, but they got to understand jokes or what is happening. Is this more terror support? These [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2154.48s)]
*  people are singing in scary language. Please stop. Yeah. Another instance of supporting terrorism [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2159.2799999999997s)]
*  once again, for showcasing method of Marsha. The whole chat said I was not for saying Trump was [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2164.48s)]
*  significantly better on Ukraine, North Korea than Democrats. And now Biden and the lame duck has [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2169.68s)]
*  massively escalated. I'm sorry, but I've been completely vindicated. I would like my flowers. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2172.8799999999997s)]
*  You won't address this because I'm correct. What Donald Trump put forth, like Warhawks in his, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2176.3199999999997s)]
*  in the competent aspects of his administration. What the fuck are you talking about? You think [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2183.12s)]
*  Marco Rubio is going to be deescalatory? No, America is the most unit party when it comes to [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2185.7599999999998s)]
*  foreign policy. Okay. Because American foreign policy is not dictated by ideological considerations. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2191.44s)]
*  American foreign policy is dictated by capitalism and upholding capitalism. Okay. Bro said he's [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2197.52s)]
*  going to end it. Yeah. Okay, dude. He also said he's going to end the fucking, he's going to [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2201.7599999999998s)]
*  let Israel finish the job on Gaza. What does that mean? You think he's going to be better on [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2206.16s)]
*  fucking Gaza? You think he's going to be better for the Palestinians? Get the fuck out of here. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2209.2s)]
*  Okay. America's interests in Ukraine have nothing to do with the, the emancipatory goals of Ukraine [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2213.52s)]
*  ridding its national boundaries of, of Russian invaders. Okay. America's goals is to offload [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2221.36s)]
*  all of their older fucking equipment and keep the fucking military engine running. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2228.4s)]
*  It is in their best interest to continue the war for as long as Ukraine can hold out for as long [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2233.1200000000003s)]
*  as Ukraine has people who can hold on to these arms and shoot in the direction of the Russian [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2237.28s)]
*  forces, America will continue to fucking escalate and America will continue to fucking, you know, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2242.7200000000003s)]
*  give Ukraine weapons over and over again. While I disagree with, you know, the long range missiles, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2247.68s)]
*  unless it's going to be a significant shift in this battle. And I don't think it will because [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2257.3599999999997s)]
*  of the reasons that I just gave you. Okay. There is no, there is no ideological difference between [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2262.7999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Okay. Emancipatory goals. Let me fail. No, I'm serious. Yeah. Like [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2268.48s)]
*  you think America is invested in like, in the freedom of Ukraine. No, they don't. They don't [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2274.0s)]
*  care about that. That's not a real thing. That's never been a real consideration. Please guys. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2279.36s)]
*  Why do you think Trump's admin is motivated entirely by capital mass deportation contradicts [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2282.88s)]
*  that the argument against mass deportation or the argument against like white nativist anti-immigrant [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2286.56s)]
*  sentiment is that it's a wonderful mechanism to distract away from the real holders of capital, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2293.12s)]
*  the real enemies of the American working class. And number two, the two tier structure that is [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2299.04s)]
*  created within documented and undocumented labor is literally the most capitalist thing. It is [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2305.44s)]
*  capitalism and overdrive. It is hyper exploitative without the proper paperwork. These people are [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2311.44s)]
*  purposefully put in a position where they're outside of the boundaries of the regular [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2317.92s)]
*  outside of the boundaries of the regular legal system where they can demand back pay and have [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2322.88s)]
*  some sort of recourse. The entire purpose of having this two tier labor structure is for [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2326.8s)]
*  capitalist interest. If there was a real, if there was a real racist white nativist anti-immigrant [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2333.04s)]
*  purpose here, they would pull the Portland route. Okay. Oregon was originally invented as a white [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2340.88s)]
*  enclave so much so that they were anti-slavery. Why were they anti-slavery? Because they didn't [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2347.44s)]
*  want to be around black people that bad. Okay. If someone was really that fucking racist, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2352.24s)]
*  if there was a real genuine racist priority here and not simply a capitalist one, they would be [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2357.52s)]
*  punishing business owners that knowingly hire undocumented labor. They will never do that. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2363.4399999999996s)]
*  Okay. It will never do that. Imagine deporting fucking corporate owners and executives for [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2368.64s)]
*  hiring migrant labor and farm hands. That would never happen in a million years. The entire system [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2374.08s)]
*  is struck. The entire system is designed in a way where you can use and hyper exploit these [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2379.2s)]
*  undocumented laborers. This depresses wages for every American across the board. Okay. It keeps the [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2384.72s)]
*  cost of goods relatively low, especially in the agricultural sector, for example. And then [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2391.68s)]
*  simultaneously, these people have no legal recourse. So then you call ICE on your own fucking labor [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2397.3599999999997s)]
*  force and you wipe them out. And then you go back to the same fucking veins and you tap a new [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2403.92s)]
*  fresh pool of undocumented migrant workers and you bring them to the same fucking trailer park that [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2410.8s)]
*  you now evicted a ton of undocumented laborers from. That's it. Is that also logic for tariffs? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2415.6000000000004s)]
*  So we blame China for everything. I still don't understand why it pushes for tariffs. I think [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2423.6000000000004s)]
*  tariffs are supposed to be a substitute for all the tax cuts that are coming in. And it's also a [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2426.6400000000003s)]
*  mechanism for Donald Trump to influence the corporate... It's a mechanism to influence [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2431.28s)]
*  corporate leaders to terrify them with the threat of tariffs in their sector if they don't comply. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2438.8s)]
*  That's what I think. So it's to clean the slate and reduce the wage prices, reduce their wage [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2445.92s)]
*  prices. I think that mass deportation will not come in the way that you think it will. I think [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2450.2400000000002s)]
*  that they are going to forcibly enslave the undocumented laborers in private prison facilities [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2455.7599999999998s)]
*  that they will build and force them back to work at gunpoint potentially. There's also a never-ending [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2461.52s)]
*  pool of undocumented workers that will always come to the United States of America. We have [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2467.52s)]
*  destroyed the global south and that is one of the many bountiful benefits of such a process. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2472.3199999999997s)]
*  Both climate change and our direct intervention of the global south have created migration patterns [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2479.52s)]
*  that are impossible to combat unless you change trajectory on foreign policy in general. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2484.8s)]
*  Okay, this has to be the craziest take I've ever heard you have. We are going to enslave people [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2492.0800000000004s)]
*  now. Come on, man. Brother, we already enslaved people. It's called the 13th Amendment. Slavery [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2496.6400000000003s)]
*  as a form of punishment is not only legal and constitutionally protected. Californians literally [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2501.52s)]
*  voted to maintain slavery as a form of punishment this past election cycle by 53%. Okay. Now, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2506.7200000000003s)]
*  of course we don't frame it in that way because of Western chauvinism. We always say, oh, work [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2514.72s)]
*  camps, Gulags. They all they do that in Russia. Okay. They do that in some one chatter said [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2521.4399999999996s)]
*  Xinjiang. Yeah, they do that in China. They do that in Russia. They don't do that here. It's like, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2527.2799999999997s)]
*  dude, we have literally the number one. We have the largest slave force on the planet. You [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2530.8799999999997s)]
*  understand that, right? We have direct state penitentiaries that are named after the plantation [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2535.9199999999996s)]
*  that they're placed upon like Angola, the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Okay. Where [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2541.36s)]
*  the overwhelming majority of the prisoners are black. And yes, they literally pick cotton. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2548.48s)]
*  Aren't they criminals? Wait, what? So you are fine with slavery. Got it. Okay. Yeah. The people in [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2554.4s)]
*  prison. Okay. We are going to be putting undocumented migrants in prison as well. And we will enslave [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2561.92s)]
*  them. Now you've arrived at exactly what I was saying. You are fine with slavery as a form of [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2566.96s)]
*  punishment. It seems like you understand exactly what we were doing. I don't think we are going to [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2571.84s)]
*  engage in mass deportation. I think we're going to engage in mass enslavement and then deportation, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2576.48s)]
*  but deportation is too costly. So we'll kill them. That's what I think. Okay. If you want to know [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2582.16s)]
*  what the, what the agenda looks like. Well, I can only look back in history at a time when this [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2588.08s)]
*  happened before. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSseM7G636g&t=2593.12s)]
