# Iran Rejects Trump's Ceasefire Claims | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0)
*  I know the Iranian military also said not only do they not get a ceasefire, but also [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=0.0s)]
*  that they're going to show that they didn't get a ceasefire proposal even at all. So I [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=5.64s)]
*  don't really know why American news is still running off of, Oh, a ceasefire happened. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=10.84s)]
*  Isn't that great? Isn't it great that Trump are big [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=16.5s)]
*  the minute, certainly by the hour in terms of the events and how quickly things have [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=20.72s)]
*  transpired 24 48 hours. And so to be at a point where we're talking about the terms [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=30.28s)]
*  of a ceasefire where Israel has said this is happening, Iran has said this is happening. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=37.8s)]
*  This is a much, much better place than where we were just mere, mere hours ago when we [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=45.440000000000005s)]
*  learned of the of the attack there within Qatar. So it is it is moving quickly. But [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=52.440000000000005s)]
*  we're all we're all very I am certainly very hopeful at the moment that we are in right [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=61.28s)]
*  now that in fact, with with the decisive measures that the president and his national security [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  team have taken, that we could be in a place where where Iran has a has a graceful exit [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=74.64s)]
*  here. You're somebody in Washington who's you know, people on both sides of the aisle [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=81.24s)]
*  consider a straight shooter, you have your what you believe in, you stand by it. Sometimes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=85.72s)]
*  it's out of favor. Sometimes it's in favor with your nope. She said Iran, I don't I don't [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=90.52s)]
*  trust their by President Trump to order the son of Ronnie new facilities given what we [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=95.36s)]
*  have seen now as the outcome. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=99.44000000000001s)]
*  Well, again, I would just caution that we are all seeing things in in real time. There [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  are many, many questions that I think we have. Certainly, those of us in Congress are going [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=108.28s)]
*  to be seeking answers tomorrow at this classified briefing. I think that that will be very, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  very instructive. But I think we all recognize the direction that Iran was was heading with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  building up their nuclear capabilities was was a place that that was not was not acceptable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  And so the decision to to to strike when the president determined so you can do a lot of of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=134.04s)]
*  Monday morning quarterbacking here trying to figure out was this the right time. But it [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=143.16s)]
*  looks at this moment. It looks at this moment where the the attacks were still going to be [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=147.96s)]
*  doing much of the damage assessment going forward, but have brought us to a place where [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  not only are you going to see a ceasefire, but amazing, amazing tweet of Trump in the past [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=162.12s)]
*  that works so perfectly for Trump right now, who is negotiating for us in the Middle East, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=172.12s)]
*  bombs are dropping all over the place. Sleepy Joe is sleeping on a beach in California, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=177.48s)]
*  viciously exiled by the Democrats and comrade Kamala is doing a campaign bus tour with tampon [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  Tim, her really bad VP pick. Let's not have world three because that's where we're heading. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=189.32s)]
*  We've also blown past the three 30 deadline. And since then, Iranians, more Iranian news sources, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  more reliable Iranian news sources are saying that they never even saw ceasefire. So I don't [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=204.44s)]
*  know what the hell's going on. I know the Iranian military also said, not only do they not get a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=210.44s)]
*  ceasefire, but also that they're going to show that they didn't get a ceasefire proposal even at all. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=216.12s)]
*  So I don't really know why American news is still running off of, oh, a ceasefire happened. Isn't [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=222.12s)]
*  that great? Isn't it great that Trump, our big, beautiful president did it again. Another ceasefire. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=228.28s)]
*  Yeah. Iran intercepts Israeli drone over Tehran by the MERS news agency, Israeli Hermes drone [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=236.2s)]
*  destroyed in Tehran. Again, this is the third of the con whether there's a ceasefire or not [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  and how stably it'll last. Let's set all of that aside for the moment and just appreciate how [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=250.44s)]
*  much these ghouls are losing their minds. There wasn't a regime change in Iran. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=254.6s)]
*  The Iranian people had a window of opportunity to take back their country. They didn't take it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=257.96s)]
*  I am surprised to say the least. I was rooting for them. Now with this ceasefire that Trump and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=266.84s)]
*  Vans pushed, they are in for another mile. The Ayatollahs maintain their stronghold. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=277.32s)]
*  It is what it is. I am sorry to say. President Trump, why won't you let my Shah become the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  president? President. What is this? Mohammed Ahwazai. Oh, this is a, this is a journal in Iran. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  Air defense has been activated in Khamenei's residence in Tehran's past or neighborhood now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=303.4s)]
*  Oh my God. Are they doing it? Are they, is Israel trying to hit the decapitation on the way out [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=307.64s)]
*  knowing that it's not the way out at all? Holy not. Ain't he in a bunker or some shit? I don't [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  know. Maybe it's a way to be like, Oh, there's a ceasefire three hours ago. No dog. That's not [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=320.84s)]
*  three hours ago. That's literally six minutes ago. I don't, he, I don't, I wouldn't assume that he's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  amidst all of this, it would be really stupid if he's in his house. But what if the bunker is [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=337.56s)]
*  under his house? Imagine, imagine the Ayatollahs like, Oh, imagine the Ayatollah was like, Oh, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  these guys would never, Oh, it's a ceasefire. I believe it. Meanwhile, Tehran is exploding. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=349.0s)]
*  And then he just, he just leaves his bunker to go to his home and he's eating Kubi day. He's like, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=355.8s)]
*  come on, man. Can't wait to post about how women is the butterfly of the home again. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  Now that we have another ceasefire, after all Americans certainly won't lie to me about this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=367.48s)]
*  I shouldn't be laughing. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=376.04s)]
*  They're they're like, let's celebrate another job. Well done. We brokered piece once again. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=386.28s)]
*  And he has, he has all of the, he has all of the leadership in the house. What's your obsession [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=394.04s)]
*  with the QB day? I love Kubi day. It's also just like a funny, it's just a funny word to say, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  we say kofta Israel has not stopped coming. And now apparently they're literally in the neighborhood [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  that the, the Ayatollah is in Kubi days kebab. That's true. Sorry. Kubi days kebab. Forbes is [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=414.6s)]
*  saying Zoran is in the lead. Yes. In one of the polls that came out, Zoran has a, has a, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=424.12s)]
*  a little bit of a lead. We'll talk about that in a little bit. There's a different [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=431.16s)]
*  Shia that I'm worried about right now than Zoran. Yeah. And also reports of drone attacks near [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=435.56s)]
*  Baghdad are still incoming. I wonder after surviving the most ferocious bombing campaign, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=443.4s)]
*  Tehran is not witnessing a calm dawn. I'm not seeing any reports of a strike in Tehran, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=448.67999999999995s)]
*  nor am I hearing any. Okay. Oh, that's it. That's it. Three minutes ago, Syed Abbas [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=452.91999999999996s)]
*  Araki as Iran has repeatedly made it clear Israel launched a war on Iran, not the other way around. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=461.56s)]
*  As of no, as of now, there is no agreement on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=466.44s)]
*  However, provided that the Israeli regime stops his illegal aggression against the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=472.44s)]
*  Iranian people no later than 4 a.m. Tehran time, we have no intention to continue our own. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=475.88s)]
*  Nevermind the final decision on the cessation of our military operations. We made later, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=481.24s)]
*  dude, dude, they literally pushed it back. Oh, they're, they pushed it back. They said 3 30. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=485.0s)]
*  Now they're saying for the fake demons is right. Oh no, 4 a.m. in Tehran. No, actually that was [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=491.72s)]
*  literally nevermind 4 a.m. in Tehran is, is I thought the initial thing that they said was [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=498.2s)]
*  Tel Aviv time. So I got it wrong. Yes, it is already past Tehran time. They're still bombing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=503.24s)]
*  Wait, why the did he post is now it's already past 4 a.m. in Tehran. That's right. They're, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=508.68s)]
*  they're half hour apart. As of now, there's no agreement, but then he announced an agreement. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=513.64s)]
*  Yeah, this doesn't make any fucking sense. Why are you so horny for Iran to stay in the war? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=519.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm not Iran to stay in the war. Iran is getting bombed right now as we speak. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=524.36s)]
*  Like I think the last time Iran bombed Israel was like, you know, earlier last night, what the fuck [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=531.48s)]
*  do you mean? What are they supposed to do? Not deescalate dog. What are you talking about? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=537.7199999999999s)]
*  Iran is still in the process of being bombed. There are some Iranian officials that have stated [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=545.7199999999999s)]
*  that there's no ceasefire that was ever given to them. Said Abbas Araxi, which is a foreign [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=552.28s)]
*  minister, came out and said that there was no agreement on any ceasefire, cessation of military [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=558.92s)]
*  operations, except apparently there is one that they are abiding by. I'm like you're, you're [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=564.92s)]
*  misunderstanding my position here. I want there to be a real ceasefire, like a complete ceasefire. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=572.52s)]
*  I just don't think that Israel is going to abide by one and the Iranian government is giving [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=579.48s)]
*  different information. But while we're having this conversation, it seems like they're bombing [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=587.08s)]
*  Ayatollah Khamenei's building, like his neighborhood. So it doesn't seem like Israel is invested in this [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=591.1600000000001s)]
*  ceasefire at all. Do you feel like this is a deescalation from the Israeli side? How the fuck [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=597.48s)]
*  can you be a 41 month subscriber? This is going to look really good for Trump. I'm surprised you [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  aren't seeing that. Why are you so horny for Iran to stay in the war? If you think any of the things [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=607.8s)]
*  that happened in the past 12 days looks good for Donald Trump, your calculation is insane. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=613.8s)]
*  Like you're predisposed to thinking you have to also, you also have to be operating with the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=619.0799999999999s)]
*  notion that Iran has to be bombed. Cause unless you genuinely think as a liberal or as a Republican [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=626.12s)]
*  that Iran must have been bombed. Okay. But we don't want to, we don't want to go into a longer [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=634.44s)]
*  conflict. You can't look at the past 12 days and be like, this was a spectacular, this was a [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=638.84s)]
*  spectacular W considering that there was so much endless bloodshed. We, we only rolled the clock [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  back to 12 days ago. If this ceasefire is real and actually implemented, I don't want Iran to stay in [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  this war. I just don't want any more war. I want an actual long lasting ceasefire and you coming in [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=657.96s)]
*  here to be like, wow, this is really tough, dude. You want more war to happen. Why won't you just [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=666.44s)]
*  give the W to the big guy? You know, if Iran doesn't retaliate to the U S this will look great for [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=670.6s)]
*  Trump. I did the math on his last bombing campaign. Can't believe you showed that on streaming coming [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=675.96s)]
*  bang. Unfortunately, that's not how the world works. This always his differences. Fridays, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=680.84s)]
*  my Mondays. What I'm so confused by the things that you're saying. Why do you keep saying you [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=683.48s)]
*  want to ceasefire with no justice and ongoing genocide? Would you be whining in 1942, the Soviet [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=687.24s)]
*  unit should have a ceasefire. So Hitler continues Holocaust. You like the libs MLK described. No [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=691.48s)]

*  Have they brought up the Palestinians at all? Have they actually struck Israel at all for the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=701.32s)]
*  Palestinians? No, the only time a Palestinian died and, and Iran retaliated was because that [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=705.88s)]
*  Palestinian died in Tehran. He was assassinated in Tehran. It was a violation of, of Iranian [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=712.12s)]
*  sovereignty. Yeah, it'd be great if Iran was like, we're lobbing these ballistic missiles for [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=718.84s)]
*  Palestine. You should stop. You should stop fucking killing Palestinians. That would [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=723.64s)]
*  dramatically change the, the calculation here. Not that it fucking matters because they also [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=728.28s)]
*  internally are making this assessment to ensure stability of the regime. And if they were to say, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=734.6s)]
*  oh, we're bombing Israel because of Palestine, then Iranians would get mad. Then they'd be like, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=740.04s)]
*  why the fuck are you? Why the fuck are you putting our lives on the line? Yeah. I mean, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=744.8399999999999s)]
*  if anything, it's like there's, there's aspects of this that are worse than 12 days ago because [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=749.88s)]
*  Iran now has a righteous cause to fucking leave the international atomic energy agency. What do [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=753.9599999999999s)]
*  you mean? Of course they're doing it for Palestine. I think you guys miscalculate Iran's interest in [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=760.28s)]
*  Palestinian emancipation. The reason why Iran defends the axis of resistance is still for [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=765.8000000000001s)]
*  their own benefit. That is the reason why they designed a million different red lines that were [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=773.08s)]
*  supposed to kick in the moment that Israel invaded Gaza. None of those red lines actually [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=778.44s)]
*  were implemented. Hezbollah was the only militancy in the region that actually followed through on [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=785.88s)]
*  the promise. And so did the Ansarullah regime. Now you can say, well, they're also backed by Iran. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=792.2s)]
*  This is true. They are, but Iran itself did not do anything. And it has the most capabilities to do [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=797.1600000000001s)]
*  something as demonstrated by the past fucking 12 days of, of relentless Iranian bombing campaigns [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=804.44s)]
*  in Tel Aviv. And in the process of Israel basically bouldering through every single fucking red line [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=809.88s)]
*  commitment that they created, that the Iranian axis of resistance had created, Israel made work [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=817.32s)]
*  of every single different regional actor slowly but surely in the process of ethnically cleansing [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=825.88s)]
*  the Palestinians and inevitably directed their crosshairs at Iran. That was eventually going to [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  happen. Iran's interest in Palestinian emancipation is born out of their interest in destabilizing [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=835.4000000000001s)]
*  American and Israeli influence in the region. It's not born out of a real emancipatory goal. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=841.64s)]
*  I think some of you have forgotten that reality. It's just they are aligned because Hamas and the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=848.4399999999999s)]
*  Palestinian population is a destabilizing force against Israel's ambitions in the region. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=855.08s)]
*  And I'm sure there's plenty of people who are, you know, genuinely on board. But make no mistake, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=860.68s)]
*  if Iran, if Iran was as invested in defending the Palestinians, they would have acted in a much more [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=866.1999999999999s)]
*  aggressive manner towards Israel for the past fucking 20 months of ethnic cleansing. Iran did [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=873.4s)]
*  not even help its own direct, Iran was unable to even help Hezbollah in the process. Anytime Iran [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=879.4799999999999s)]
*  is retaliated towards Israel is when Israel attacked Iran first. Yeah, bro, sure. Since 1979, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=889.24s)]
*  RGC's laws like 500 generals defending Palestine and South Lebanon gives 5% of its annual military [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=895.24s)]
*  bridge to the Hamas as well. Yet you still call them non-emancipatory. They're literally the only [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=899.48s)]
*  alt. They're literally the only altruistic state in the ME. Dude, I'm not minimizing their fucking [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=903.64s)]
*  impact. I'm not. I'm just simply telling you that there is a secondary, there's a primary purpose [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=910.04s)]
*  for this. Also, no state is altruistic to others. Don't be ridiculous. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=915.64s)]
*  The reports of the bombings have stopped them to head on, which will be consistent with some of the [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=922.84s)]
*  agreed upon deadlines stipulated in the ceasefire. Everyone I've spoken to said this was the worst [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=926.04s)]
*  night of the last 12 early, early ceasefire was, was real, but I don't know. I said, no state is [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=929.72s)]
*  altruistic. This guy said America is brother. What are you saying? America is the least altruistic [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=936.84s)]
*  state. The Soviet Union didn't enter the war out of altruism either. Your argument is pretty bad. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=945.48s)]
*  Wait, what? I don't disagree with that. That is my argument. States can engage in emancipatory acts [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=950.44s)]
*  for other groups. The USSR's cold war initiatives. You could make the argument. We're not born out of [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=957.0s)]
*  a real desire to liberate people in the global South, but instead was to beef up allegiances [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=963.0s)]
*  and create a, a, a multipolar state with allies all around the military operations of our powerful [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=969.72s)]

*  dear country until the last drop of blood and responded to any attack by the enemy until the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=986.6s)]
*  very last minute. This doesn't make sense because they said they were going to show, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=990.36s)]
*  uh, they're going to show Israel that the ceasefire is not real or whatever. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=995.56s)]
*  Bro, spare me this anarchist Western byzo talk. Iran has lost much, much more than it has gained [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1000.84s)]
*  in these last 46 years of helping Palestine. Iran is ideologically the Islamic equivalent of [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1005.64s)]
*  Maoist China. I don't care if a westerner can't understand this. Iran's regional interests align [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1009.64s)]
*  with the emancipatory goals of the Palestinians. It's regional interests align with the emancipatory [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1018.5999999999999s)]
*  goals of the Shia population in Lebanon. It's emancipatory interests align with like the, the, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1025.8s)]
*  the, uh, Iran's regional interests align with the Shia Houthi families interest in the civil [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1035.1599999999999s)]
*  struggle. The civil war is a place in Yemen. I'm not discounting the metric ton of blood [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1041.24s)]
*  and weapons that Iran has, uh, has, has given to all of the regional actors. But when push comes [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1048.68s)]
*  to shove and the state's interests overcome those emancipatory needs, you see the way that Iran [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1057.0800000000002s)]
*  reacts. Iran, even when it comes to their own defenses has behaved in a matter that is so [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1065.72s)]
*  restrained that it only creates a larger permission structure to Israel to strike back and harder. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1075.24s)]
*  Yeah. Also Maoist China is not the best example as far as, as far as foreign policy goes, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1082.44s)]
*  because there was some pretty big issues with, with Mao's allegiances in the region. Anyway, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1088.04s)]
*  I know what you meant when you said that. Okay. I don't, I think Korea and less Kim, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1093.8s)]
*  a Rouge, for example, that's what I suspect you were saying more, more like look at what they did [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1101.48s)]
*  in Korea. Like look at how much they helped out in Korea versus what they were doing with a pole [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1108.2s)]
*  pot. But my point remains all of Iran's top brass, including a Rahshi Haman and every single general [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1113.32s)]
*  were young men during the Iran Iraq war. That war was basically the Western front of world war one [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1119.08s)]
*  in my opinion, the Iranian leadership is reluctant to risk all out war, especially as they know [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1123.56s)]
*  that's exactly what Israel wants. They're really in a rock and a hard place right now. Sure. Yes. I [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1126.9199999999998s)]
*  agree with that. What odd claim from convicted tax fraudster and generous Hasbro funder, Adam [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1131.96s)]
*  Milstein looks like how many and his deputies have been marginalized and are no longer charged in Iran. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1140.12s)]
*  The ceasefire agreement was done with the new leadership of Iran. What the wait, that follows [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1145.48s)]
*  me? Oh no. Oh, that's scary. That's concerning. Something about something about Iranian correspondence [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1151.64s)]
*  so far simply does not add up. I don't know what it is. I don't know. I don't know what's going on, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1161.4s)]
*  but there's something that is not making sense on the Iranian side. I'm in Israel just three hours [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1167.96s)]
*  from now, but it's still unclear exactly where the Israelis stand on this ceasefire agreement. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1172.92s)]
*  All right. That's how to zero is Hamdas Alhoud live for us out of Amman. Thanks so much. Hamda [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1179.56s)]
*  Adam Clements is a U S foreign policy analyst and former Pentagon official. He says while Israel and [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1183.64s)]
*  the U S say they've met their objectives in this conflict, it's unclear what state Iran's nuclear [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1188.84s)]
*  program is left in. I think that even Iran may not know fully what its capabilities it still has. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1193.72s)]
*  I think it's difficult to account for some of the enriched uranium that Iran had. I think it's [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1201.08s)]
*  reasonable to think that there, damn Adam, we get it bro. Jesus Christ. Just the know-how of the [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1208.44s)]

*  Of course, it's probably, we just don't know how many months. And so I think before [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1222.28s)]
*  the past few hours, when we didn't really know if there'd be any opening for a ceasefire, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1230.1200000000001s)]

*  It did cause some panic and fear initially, but it quickly subsided once people realized what had [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1437.8799999999999s)]
*  happened and that hopefully was the attack by the Iranians on the U.S. military base known as [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1443.16s)]
*  Al-Udayd Air Base here in Qatar. This is a military base that's been here since 1996. The Qataris built [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1450.92s)]
*  it at the cost of a billion dollars, and it's been home to the biggest U.S. military presence in the [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1459.0s)]
*  region. About 10,000 U.S. military personnel call this base their home. But, of course, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1465.96s)]
*  this attack came clearly with prior warnings. The Qatari government was aware that Iran was [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1474.52s)]
*  going to launch this attack. The American and British embassies issued warnings to their citizens [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1480.52s)]
*  to take cover in the country, as well as the government announcing the temporary closure of [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1486.52s)]
*  its airspace over the Qatari skies. This attack clearly a message not only to the U.S. government, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1490.84s)]
*  but also to the regional countries in the Middle East that house U.S. military bases, that Iran has [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1500.28s)]
*  the capability to attack them at any time. But clearly, choosing one of its closest allies and [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1507.32s)]
*  friends, the Iranians, chose Qatar to launch this attack, which has been seen as symbolic because [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1513.08s)]
*  there has been no casualties reported and no injuries. And the Iranians have said that their [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1519.88s)]
*  target was the U.S. military base and not the state of Qatar. The Qatari government, for their part, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1527.4s)]
*  have condemned the attack and also called for a de-escalation of the current crisis that is [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1533.4s)]
*  ongoing between Iran and Israel. Dorsa Jabari, Al Jazeera, Doha. And Iraqi state media says an [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1540.6000000000001s)]
*  unidentified drone has targeted a site at Iraq's Taji military base. A large fire has been seen at [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1547.88s)]
*  the base just north of the capital. Yeah, I don't know what the problem with the Iraq bases. I don't [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1553.5600000000002s)]
*  think it was, I don't think it was Iran directly because we would have seen it. And even if they [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1558.3600000000001s)]
*  had any sort of strike capabilities while they're getting, even if they had any striking capabilities [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1567.3200000000002s)]
*  while they were getting pummeled by Israel, I suspect that they wouldn't be using that on Iraq, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1573.4s)]
*  but instead open presence with another hundred gift to subs. God damn Qatar. Spoilers are here. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1579.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Now that it is seemingly now that things have seemingly quieted down. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1585.3200000000002s)]
*  Okay. And this was the final message. I don't, okay. Couple of things. One, I don't know [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1589.16s)]
*  what is going on on the Iranian side, the Iranian leadership. There are inconsistencies in the [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1597.48s)]
*  messaging. It could be born out of like how fast this ceasefire was implemented. I do believe that [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1604.6s)]
*  the, the Iranian leadership would absolutely dive at the first shot, dive at the first shot of a [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1611.16s)]
*  ceasefire though that that tracks with their, with their track record. So I can totally see that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1619.16s)]
*  However, however, another hundred gets us a cinematic. God damn beyond the inconsistencies [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1624.12s)]
*  on the Iranian side, as far as messaging, as if we're going to analyze like Trump, the big, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1632.36s)]
*  beautiful peacemaking president, this is yet another like tariffs are on, tariffs are off [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1639.2399999999998s)]
*  style situation. Tariffs are on. Everybody panics. Everybody yells at Trump. Trump scales back the [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1645.9599999999998s)]
*  tariffs. Everybody goes, Oh, actually we love that there were no tariffs to begin with. You're [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1653.56s)]
*  so great. Okay. There's also this, you know, obviously Yashar Ali's assessment here saying [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1657.48s)]
*  one of the most prolific propagandists for the Islamic Republic of Iran, furious that there's [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1664.44s)]
*  been some sort of ceasefire agreement goes off message. He attacks president and foreign [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1667.3999999999999s)]
*  minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This post has been since deleted. I don't, I don't like [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1670.84s)]
*  that. The, the assessment of Yashar Ali aside, this tweet in and of itself also, I think is, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1676.44s)]
*  is more about the, the inconsistencies of this deal. I don't know how, I don't know who the [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1684.8400000000001s)]
*  f*****g person is overall. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what, why, like I, I don't, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1690.2s)]
*  I don't understand what is happening with the Iranian side because they said that they would [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1696.44s)]
*  not, they said that they wouldn't, the Ayatollah statements contradict what they ended up doing [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1703.24s)]
*  in the end. Ali Abunima says Iran appears to have given Israel a reprieve. Israel will thank Iran [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1708.84s)]
*  by escalating its efforts to bring about the collapse and destruction of Iran's government [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1713.56s)]
*  and society. Let's hope there's more to this agreement than just quiet for quiet for now. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1716.52s)]
*  That's what I think as well, because I think the only reason why Israel said yes to this is because [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1720.28s)]
*  Trump showed that he didn't have more appetite for further escalations on the American side. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1726.84s)]
*  Iranians did the thing that they always do, which is limited retaliation. But because Israel's air [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1732.84s)]
*  defenses are in tatters and significantly, significantly depleted without America joining [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1740.12s)]
*  the conflict with a serious escalation, like straight up actively taking an active role in, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1749.4799999999998s)]
*  in the conflict. I don't think Israel's offensive campaigns were going to be enough to stop the [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1757.32s)]
*  Iranian ballistic missiles from flying in the Tel Aviv. So that is the reason why, especially [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1762.9199999999998s)]
*  that, and also the fact that Israel's goal here wasn't to just take out Israel's goal here was to [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1767.9599999999998s)]
*  take out the nuclear facilities or whatever is also bullshit. They didn't meet any of their [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1776.4399999999998s)]
*  military goals. They did not meet any of their military goals here at all. And they didn't get [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1780.84s)]
*  to do what they wanted to do, which was to do decapitation strikes and full blown regime change. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1787.1599999999999s)]
*  And America did not bite. They did though. How do you know? Because there's no nukes chatter. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1793.72s)]
*  That's why, because there's no nukes because Israel's ultimate goal of nukes was bullshit. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1800.6799999999998s)]
*  That wasn't real. That wasn't a real situation at all. They just made that up. Why would they [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1807.32s)]
*  make something like that up? Because they wanted to do regime change in Iran. The speculation part [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1812.9199999999998s)]
*  of this is that is not even speculation. America did not join the conflict beyond America did not [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1818.04s)]
*  join the conflict beyond bombing the Fordow sites and the two other nuclear sites. One where they [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1824.52s)]
*  were developing the Fordow site is where they're enriching the uranium and the other two nuclear [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1833.08s)]
*  sites as well. That was very limited overall. We still don't know if they actually successfully [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1838.52s)]
*  destroyed these sites. But once again, Iran had already, Iran had already talked about how they [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1845.24s)]
*  had moved the enriched uranium away from Fordow. So the new part of this is, is a red hair [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1851.6399999999999s)]
*  and it's bullshit. It's not real. They also voted in the parliament to pull out of the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1863.0s)]
*  international atomic energy. It's a red herring till someone gets nuked. We did that shit in Iraq. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1869.88s)]
*  We got a ton of ships parked out there, man. I don't, don't get it twisted. Yeah. Okay. But [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1874.84s)]
*  if you understand, we did that shit in Iraq. You understand that it was a massive failure. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1879.24s)]
*  It's a, it's, it didn't even happen in Iran this time. Iraq is what, Iraq is what Israel wants to [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1882.92s)]
*  do in Iran. They failed to do that this time around. The reason why they failed to do that [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1891.88s)]
*  is because they don't have the capacity to do that to Iran or any other country on their own. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1896.68s)]
*  They can only do that if big daddy America joins the fight and big daddy America joined the fight [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1903.16s)]
*  in a very limited fashion this time around. They didn't go beyond, they did not go beyond what, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1909.4s)]
*  what the, the, the most, I mean, it was still a severe escalation, make no mistake, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1915.48s)]
*  but they didn't go past blowing up the three nuclear sites. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1921.64s)]
*  In the process, Israel realized that they did not have the air defense capabilities [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1929.08s)]
*  and was more willing to back away from further escalation, which is why I assume when Iran did [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1934.1200000000001s)]
*  the exact same thing that they've done, like they did in 2020 after the Qasem Soleimani [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1942.28s)]
*  assassination, like they've done in all of the Operation True Promises so far, when they attacked [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1946.76s)]
*  in a retaliatory manner in an effort to maintain some semblance of sovereignty in a, in an effort [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1953.3999999999999s)]
*  to save face and get a symbolic retaliation in the books, America was fine with that de-escalation. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1959.24s)]
*  So this ceasefire was implemented. The reason why I still say Iran lost in this, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1971.48s)]
*  Iran lost a lot in this process is not only because they had a ton of people die in the process, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1977.96s)]
*  but they also lost any sort of sovereignty they possibly could push for because they lost their [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1986.3600000000001s)]
*  air defense capabilities and they allowed Israel to have air superiority over numerous parts of the [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=1994.28s)]
*  extended periods of time. They got attacked by America, they got attacked by Israel, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2001.56s)]
*  they lost high ranking IRGC members in the process, but ultimately Israel lost more than Iran did. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2009.0s)]
*  So this is, I don't think that this is a, this is a victory for Iran, especially considering that [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2015.6399999999999s)]
*  I suspect Israel is going to simply re-up and re-arm their air defenses, take note of the holes [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2023.8s)]
*  that exist within their anti-air defense capabilities, like they did after Operation [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2032.68s)]
*  True Promise 2, okay? They will also be able to re-up and re-arm in the process and then try this [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2039.32s)]
*  out one more time. If you think that this is done for Israel, you're wrong. I don't think Israel is [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2045.48s)]
*  done with Iran. I don't think Israel is done with Iran at all. Sufficient retaliation from Iran in [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2051.16s)]
*  this process would mean that Israel would be running to America to demand a ceasefire, to get [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2057.3199999999997s)]
*  a ceasefire done because they were incurring too many penalties from Iran. They would be, their [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2065.72s)]
*  their counter-strikes and their air force targets in Iran would also be diminished, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2074.36s)]
*  but that didn't happen. Iran's retaliation on the other hand, especially on the last day of this [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2084.2000000000003s)]
*  ceasefire just now, was incredibly diminished. They claimed that they were going to strike Iran [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2089.8s)]
*  one last time and they never did. And they basically let Israel unload without any sort [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2095.32s)]
*  of retaliation back at Israel whatsoever. That they were not untouchable, that they were not immune [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2101.0s)]
*  to retaliation. They were not immune to incurring penalties for Israeli society. That's it. If this [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2108.12s)]
*  were to be, if this were to be a significant victory for Israel, this would be continuing right [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2115.24s)]
*  now. Like what Israel is doing, the bombing campaigns would be going on, there'd be no [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2121.08s)]
*  ceasefire. America would have joined the conflict in a much more meaningful capacity. Iran would be [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2125.32s)]
*  using a significant amount of their defense capabilities and offensive capabilities on [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2133.32s)]
*  American positions. It would be devastating. There'd be far more bloodshed, but Israel doesn't [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2138.6000000000004s)]
*  give a shit. That's what their goal was. I think this was humiliating for Benjamin Netanyahu as [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2143.8s)]
*  well. The amount of bloodshed that Israel was able to cause in Iran without achieving any of [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2149.88s)]
*  their specific military goals is a humiliation for Benjamin Netanyahu. That on top of the rest of [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2157.48s)]
*  the world literally either celebrating or staying quiet watching Tel Aviv buildings get demolished [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2166.28s)]
*  by Iranian ballistic missiles probably also doesn't feel great for Israeli society in general. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2174.68s)]
*  Dan Cohen says at any point at this point, the default assumption that must, the default [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2180.2s)]

*  change. You'd be foolish to put it mildly to trust Netanyahu and Trump. I agree with that. But if I [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2192.2799999999997s)]
*  can see that and random Twitter analysts can see that I am assuming that the IRGC and the Ayatollah [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2196.04s)]
*  is also aware of this reality. A senior U S official said the blueprint for Monday's [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2202.92s)]
*  ceasefire agreement came from discussions with Iranian officials who made it clear to the Trump [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2207.7200000000003s)]

*  seemingly not too happy about the ceasefire. You'll see, you'll see, you'll see in, in the [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2219.48s)]
*  upcoming hours, if not the upcoming days, who actually lost or what kind of, of [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2225.88s)]

*  There's going to be a lot of anger and resentment and be like, what was this all for? We lost 25 of [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2240.12s)]
*  our big, beautiful citizens. We lost entire city blocks, reduced the rubble. And you couldn't even [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2245.32s)]
*  take out the Ayatollah. How dare you, you know, shit like that. Let's see what the [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2251.24s)]
*  Israel's greatest defender in America has to say. So what would I say about the ceasefire? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2257.24s)]
*  If the ceasefire is genuine and will lead the peace, it is a major league accomplishment. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2262.04s)]
*  If the ceasefire is used to rearm and regroup by Iran, we've gone backwards. How can you [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2268.7599999999998s)]
*  determine the difference? So what would I say? Yeah. I just don't trust the American government [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2275.16s)]
*  and I don't trust the Israeli government at all when they say they want to ceasefire. But [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2282.92s)]
*  that's usually what happens when you use the previous negotiations as cover to implement a [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2290.2799999999997s)]
*  first strike and continue a bombing campaign for 12 days straight. So who knows [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2297.96s)]
*  what? Hassan doesn't trust America. What a shocker. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2306.68s)]
*  If, okay, close your eyes for a moment and think of yourself outside of, of living in the boundaries [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2310.04s)]
*  of this state. Okay. You're a country that is not your country that has been branded a foreign [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2315.8s)]
*  adversary of the United States of America. You go to the table, you go to the negotiation table in [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2320.28s)]
*  good faith. Okay. You set up a deal, close your eyes. You set up a deal. After this country has [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2324.92s)]
*  already implemented sanctions on you, you set a deal with them and you abide by said deal. Then [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2330.84s)]
*  elections happen. The next president comes in and immediately casts aside that deal that you put [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2336.6800000000003s)]
*  together. You still abide by the principles of the deal. Then that president adds additional [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2342.28s)]
*  sanctions in spite of you continuing the deal. And then you say, okay, well, I'm going to start, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2347.88s)]
*  you know, creating nuclear silos. I'm going to start enriching uranium again. That president [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2353.48s)]
*  goes away. A more favorable quote unquote, supposedly favorable president comes into power. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2359.32s)]
*  Now you're thinking, oh, we can re-implement the same agreement. After all, this president [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2364.6s)]
*  was the vice president when I had a deal with America. That never comes. Okay. All the while, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2368.6s)]
*  the party that is like your immediate foreign adversary, the regional power is doing everything [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2376.12s)]
*  in its power to destabilize the region and expand and keep killing all of your proxies, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2382.84s)]
*  keep killing all of the people that you have supported. Okay. You still go, we have to do [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2389.2400000000002s)]
*  negotiation. There's nothing, there's nothing we can do here. We have to do a negotiation. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2396.76s)]
*  These are Americans. Maybe this time it will be different. You watch that same country over all [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2402.2000000000003s)]
*  of the other regional proxies that you have, you have defended in the past. You watch them [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2409.56s)]
*  cooperate with other regional adversaries in the process of over your regional proxies. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2416.36s)]
*  You say, nah, it'll be different with us. I'm sure we'll be able to get a deal done. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2423.24s)]
*  Then they sick their attack dog on you while using the denuclearization agreement that you [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2429.64s)]
*  were implementing or that you were at the table negotiating. The attack dog strikes you in the [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2435.64s)]
*  process. And then the country that you're negotiating with also hits you. How could you [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2441.56s)]
*  ever trust this country again? How could you ever turn around and be like, well, you know, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2446.7599999999998s)]
*  it seems like these guys are definitely a normal nation state. It seems like these guys are [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2452.7599999999998s)]
*  definitely going to be dealing with us as even partners. I would literally turn around and [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2459.24s)]
*  immediately rush to China. I'd be like, listen, listen, dog, we are a vassal state for you. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2465.9599999999996s)]
*  Okay. For your interest, for your ambitions, use me like a weapon. That's what I would do. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2472.8399999999997s)]
*  I'd be like, we have gotten nothing from these guys. We are no longer capable of being [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2477.8799999999997s)]
*  a friendly cooperative partner to the West because they don't want us. They don't want us at all. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2485.2400000000002s)]
*  I'd go to Russia. I'd go to China. I'd be like, give me the, give me the, the, the aircrafts. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2490.76s)]
*  Give me the S 400s. Give me the Dongfeng missiles. I will strap me to the Dongfeng missiles and, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2496.44s)]
*  and lob me in their direction. I am your servant. That's what I would say. If you think China would [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2503.48s)]
*  say, yes, you'd be insane. I don't, I don't think so. I will buy all of the Labooboos. So my point is [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2507.96s)]
*  I don't think this is a real ceasefire, but we'll see. I also don't, I don't think Israel's too [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2514.44s)]
*  happy. I don't think Israel's happy about this process at all. We shall see what they do with [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2521.8s)]
*  all of their anger and all of their resentment, probably punish the Palestinians even more. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2528.52s)]
*  It feels like the first Gaza ceasefire rolls come back 10 X harder. Today's a massive victory for [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2533.2400000000002s)]
*  American neo-conservatives. They have proven America's untouchable and can bomb whoever we [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2538.92s)]
*  want with no consequences. When with one attack, mag isolationism is dead. There's also that too. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2542.6s)]
*  There's also that side of the equation as well, because you're not wrong. I mean, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2549.56s)]
*  mag isolationism was dead. The moment that Trump decided to [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhXw2Hfw0&t=2553.96s)]
