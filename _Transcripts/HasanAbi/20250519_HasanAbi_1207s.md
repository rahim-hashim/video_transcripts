# HasanAbi Talks To BadEmpanada On Noah’s Stream | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk)
*  I wish you would have brought up Argentinian history with a bad empanada. Why? It's not my [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=0.0s)]
*  field of expertise at all. I'm not very knowledgeable on that stuff, but anyway, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=6.0s)]
*  yeah, we, we had a, we had a fun conversation last night. That was very instructive. Guess what? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=10.72s)]
*  I was right. Of course it didn't turn into a last night at the end of the broadcast. And what did I [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=16.0s)]
*  do? I did this. This is what I did. Now I wasn't in a main outfit. Neither was bad empanada. No, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=28.48s)]
*  it was all in a bait made outfit. More talk with bad empanada. You two want to off. Yeah, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=37.2s)]
*  that's what I did. I went on Noah Samson stream fundraising for Palestine, but also, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=42.24s)]
*  while it was fundraising for Palestine, I also was, you know, engaging in heated debate with [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=49.36s)]
*  an interlocutor. For those of you who don't know, I was on with bad empanada where he found out [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=57.28s)]
*  that my perspective on a lot of the issues that he criticizes me on is actually quite similar to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=68.16s)]
*  his, and that the only major point of disagreement that we have is, is negligible. And that disagreement [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=75.28s)]
*  usually just revolves around me criticizing his technique. It was surprisingly great debate. It [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=83.36s)]
*  wasn't a debate. Why would you think that it would be a real debate? That's why I kept saying [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=88.72s)]
*  whenever bad empanadas fans or fans of mine who like bad empanada would come in to my chat to be [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  annoying and I would tell them all the time that him and I do not disagree on things. We simply [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=98.96s)]
*  disagree on techniques, tactics, things of that nature. But that's it. In any case, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=105.84s)]
*  start a political podcast. You are so much better with chat, not distracting you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=110.8s)]
*  Maybe. But yeah, it was it was interesting stuff overall. Good conversations overall. I'm sure that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=114.64s)]
*  there will be I'm sure that there will be a lot of normal responses to it. Our haters, our [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=124.08s)]
*  hater communities and whatnot, but who gives a shit about what they think? All right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=130.16s)]
*  All right. Other than that, I mean, I was on I was basically on the Noah Samson stream for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=134.0s)]
*  quite a while until until like 10. And then after I was done with the Noah Samson stream, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  I went to sleep like instantly I insta locked, I insta locked bed, and I woke up early as hell [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  in the morning, went to play basketball, lost two of the games, one one of the one on one games. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=160.96s)]
*  There's something severely wrong with me. I don't like talking about my own personal health because [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=166.24s)]
*  people get really parasocial and annoying about it. But let me tell you something, folks, my heart [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=170.8s)]
*  rate is at one eighty five every time I'm playing one on one pickup basketball. Now, one on one [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=176.0s)]
*  pickup basketball, the thirteen with ones and twos. That's already a complicated endeavor. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  Or also playing on hard top concrete outdoor basketball. But it's like I'm always I'm always [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=185.84s)]
*  like maxing out on my heart rate. I'm always maxing out on my one eighty five heart rates. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=192.72s)]
*  Probably not good. One eighty five for your age is close to death. I mean, my shit is like, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=198.88s)]
*  you know, sixty to ninety around sixty to ninety when I'm normally sitting around. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  But when I'm actually playing basketball, one eighty five is what I'm cranking it up to on my [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=210.72s)]
*  iPhone. I mean, on my watch. And I mean, it's maxed out for sure. Heart rate max is two twenty [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  minus your age. So you're fine. I'm maxing it out every time, though. And it's like cooking me a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  little bit. And I think I just need to get better cardio and I don't know what it is. And I am, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=227.04s)]
*  you know, I'm having respiratory issues, I guess. I don't know what it is. It's frustrating. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=233.68s)]
*  This is not an invitation for you to all portray yourselves as little doctors or whatever. But [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=239.76s)]
*  that was one thing. That was one thing. And then afterwards, Ted Nivison came to the courts [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=245.6s)]
*  and we were bawling and he almost poked my eye out. We played one. We played like we started [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  playing the game one on one, me versus Ted. OK, and he's a little bit of a fowler and it's fine. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=258.08s)]
*  You know, he goes in, he goes in for a bucket. I stop him. I cross him once he hits me in the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=265.2s)]
*  chest and I was like, we were laughing about it. It was like, what kind of defense is that? You [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=272.96s)]
*  just like hit me and you just poke me in the chest. And he was like, yeah, that's how I defend. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=276.24s)]
*  And then he did it again. But this time he poked me in the eye in my right eye. And he almost Dan [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=280.56s)]
*  Crenshaw my ass. He almost Dan Crenshaw my ass chat. I couldn't see. I couldn't see out of my eye. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  And I was like, oh shit, like I can't see out of my right eye. Right. And then when I open both of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=292.88s)]
*  my eyes, eventually I could only like I had double vision. OK, I had double vision. And then. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=298.56s)]
*  And then not only did I have not only did I have double vision, but like finally, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  when I close my eyes, like my left eye was fine, but my right eye I couldn't see well out of it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  It was like weirdly Ted Nivison, Ted Nivision, Ted Novision. And basically what ended up happening [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=319.92s)]
*  is like I when I move my right eye for the longest time, like for a couple hours afterwards, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=327.92s)]
*  when I move my right eye, it would be like shaky vision. You know how like the thing flickers a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=336.32s)]
*  little bit like my camera flickers a little bit when I move my right eye around, my vision would [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  flicker in the same way that like, you know, the camera will not be able to focus sometimes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=349.36s)]
*  And did you call a doctor? No, I got better. So I'm fine. I was my mom was freaking out, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  wanted me to actually everything I'm wearing is Yoji. ID on the shirt, please. Big man is Yoji. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=361.2s)]
*  Everything I'm Yoji doubt the wazoo. This is the fully Yoji fit. I'm on my Yoji shit. So no, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=365.6s)]
*  I didn't get it checked out because I'm fine now. I'm fine now. But it was pretty pretty messed up [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=371.36s)]
*  for a second. I felt little when you buy new clothes, do you get rid of others? Yes. Listen [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=377.68s)]
*  to your mom. She's a doctor. Yeah, but she's not a doctor of medicine. The doctor of art. What does [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=384.24s)]
*  she know? Do you do cardio regularly? Yes, I do cardio regularly. But it's fine now. I mean, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=390.08s)]
*  I was doing tests on my I was doing tests on my shit. And I think for a little bit, like the eyes [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  like a muscle, you know, right? I feel like there's muscles around it. And it was like there was a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=402.08s)]
*  little bit of an injury and it like moved around weirdly. I was doing the test to myself filming [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=408.88s)]
*  myself doing the the little test of like following the thingy around. And I realized that my right [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=414.24s)]
*  eye was like the eyes organ and the muscles surrounding it are still muscles and he hit like [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  the muscles surrounding it. And I think that made it I think that that maybe made my eye a little [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  wonky for a second. But I'm good now. I'm good now. It moves fine. Now. That's all it is. I treat [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=434.0s)]
*  my body like a playground playground. You treat yours like a temple. My shit started going to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=439.2s)]
*  hell at 45. You'll be fine. I mean, I treat it like a temple. But but I also I desecrate the temple [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=442.88s)]
*  regularly. You know what I mean? Bitsy the rock. Thank you for the five gifted subs. You're treating [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  yours like a wonderwall. Nice. Leftist medicine. Yeah, be careful. You'll get pinworms from his [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=455.12s)]
*  fingernails is funny. All right, what is this? What is this? Balder lion? The lion of the real [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=460.64s)]
*  lion of Syria? What is he saying? He talked about Lizzo? Yeah. Yeah, you missed all the Lizzo [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=470.56s)]
*  discourse. You missed me giving 45 minutes of my opinion on Justin Trudeau's divorce. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=475.6s)]
*  You're definitely watching the right Twitch channel. Do you look at does the title down here? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=481.68s)]
*  Is it all caps emoji? Get in here. Bullet point list of all the big news happening today. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=486.16s)]
*  Open parentheses gaming after it turns out that last part was a lie. Dude, what are these shots [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  being fired? You know, I'm sick and tired. I'm sick and tired of a political. He did this. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  Is this Oh, this is from two years ago. Oh, I was gonna say because I feel like I remember him [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  saying this before, but it's like, I'm sick and tired of these apolitical content creators who [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=510.72s)]
*  don't actually let their true political perspectives be known and simply use attacks against me as a way [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=518.96s)]
*  to position themselves in the realm of politics. And Northern lion is doing that. Okay. He's doing [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  that. And the veracity of his claims has no bearing on this. Okay. He might be completely right. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=532.72s)]
*  He might be completely right on that. The gaming part of the title is a lie. Yes. But ultimately, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=539.76s)]
*  ultimately, ultimately he's still attacking me for, for his posturing as a, to, to, to prove his [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=546.96s)]
*  political bone a few days, by the way, speaking of which we got to watch this video. I just saw it on [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=560.64s)]
*  my feed. Man carrying, man carrying ting. He done did it again. Speaking of which I love this. I [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=564.8s)]
*  love this video. Look at this. The title of this is why is this 90% of political content on YouTube? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=572.4s)]
*  I hate talking about this stuff. Politics is boring. Politics is stupid as hell. I actually [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  try to keep out of politics. I think both sides are stupid. I think both sides have some good [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  points. I'm actually a political, I'd call myself a centrist. I have no real opinion on politics. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=593.28s)]
*  And I don't consider myself educated enough to discuss the topic. Here's why people should [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  stop criticizing Israel. Yep. There it is. There it is. Yeah. Based. Oh, I love that. I love that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  That is literally bro. This is a 47 second synopsis and it's basically everything. It's, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=622.96s)]
*  it's the, it's every type of every type of slop tubers first four. Okay. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=632.88s)]
*  I like that. YouTubers are aware of it though. Look at this. It's always been a policy of mine [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=642.08s)]
*  to stay out of politics on this channel, which is why I'm prefacing my ninth consecutive politically [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=646.4000000000001s)]
*  motivated video with that statement. But this is something I just don't feel comfortable staying [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=649.84s)]
*  neutral on. Here's why women shouldn't be. I'm a political with the exception of the numerous [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  extreme political convictions. I have 50%. It's so, it's so fantastic. It's so fantastic. Everybody, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=659.2s)]
*  everybody that is always like, I hate politics. I'm so a political, I'm so neutral on everything. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=668.4s)]
*  Trump is content. Trump is a content president. I'm only looking at this from the perspective [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=674.8000000000001s)]
*  of drama. Also suspiciously, all of my political worldview is directly tailored around some of the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=679.6s)]
*  most extremist reactionary points of view you have ever encountered in your life. And as a matter of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=688.4s)]
*  fact, if I were to tell you what my true opinions are, you would probably be horrified by them. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=694.24s)]
*  Also, I am utterly afraid of saying what my true political opinions are, even on my channel and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=700.08s)]
*  certainly in broad daylight around other human beings with an earshot, because I'm worried that [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=706.88s)]
*  they would kill me with hammers. If I were to reveal what I truly believe must be done to women. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=712.0s)]
*  Like it's great. It's great. Everyone that says that they're a political [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=717.52s)]
*  will just like regurgitate the stupidest, the stupidest, most insane, most heinous, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=724.4s)]
*  fucking reactionary points of view. Fear and was great. Also, I've been not being [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=732.88s)]
*  those misogyny allegations telling a cutie to get pregnant. What is this? You and bad empanada last [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=737.68s)]
*  night. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=743.12s)]
*  So funny. I mean, it's true. It is true. Also. Yeah, I think a lot of what a lot of Americans [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=762.88s)]
*  miss, I think, especially white Americans, like whiteness is such a poison for you. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=788.4s)]
*  A lot of you miss having some kind of some kind of like a Balkan style, ethnic conflict that has [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=795.52s)]
*  that is historical ref reference over thousands of years at this point. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=806.88s)]
*  Like when you're an American, when you're in a white, when you're a white American, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=811.84s)]
*  there's this new trout. There is this like, like dullness to your history, unfortunately, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=815.04s)]
*  where you don't get to, you don't get to have like, you don't get to have these like ethnic [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=823.04s)]
*  tensions that you can re litigate over and over again for, for humor and jokes. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=829.36s)]
*  Do you see what I'm saying? Like bad empanada immediately. I clocked them as a, as a Cypriot. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=835.52s)]
*  Okay. Immediately. I clocked them as a, as a Greek. I can tell. Oh my God. Some of you need to [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=841.44s)]
*  not be allowed on the internet. Some of you should be discontinued from using the internet. Holy moly. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=847.6s)]
*  That is wow. Anyway. What was I saying? When you Trump the mandate sterilization. Okay. Not me. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  My family came over from hunger in the sixties. So I've heard unspeakable things said about [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  Romanians and crochet. Yeah. That's what I mean. It makes, it makes life more fun. It makes life [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=866.96s)]
*  more fun when you have a constant, constant ethnic conflict that you can point to that you can present. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=876.48s)]
*  Not true. Go to an Ohio versus Michigan game. Those two states literally went to war once. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. That's what I mean. It's the closest thing you can get to like having two identical parties [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=888.24s)]
*  in every way, shape or form actually engage with one another in the field of battle for no real reason. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=893.92s)]
*  Despite having a lot more similarities than differences, you know, bro's completely [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=899.92s)]
*  forgetting the British. No, I'm not. I'm saying for Americans, Americans are American culture is so [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=904.8s)]
*  streamlined, so processed that I think like, especially whiteness in America renders you [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=911.68s)]
*  incapable of having like fun, little ethnic, fun, little ethnic tensions that you can point to [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=920.08s)]
*  throughout history. Do you not understand what I mean? No, British people have that as well, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  for sure. For their neighbors, dudes that live in like one zip code over have been fighting one [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=929.92s)]
*  another for fucking generations. They sound, they sound so different from one another that [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=935.44s)]
*  it's indecipherable. You can't even, you can't even understand what one guy is saying over the next. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=940.72s)]
*  You need subtitles for both. You got to have that America's too young, too vibrant, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=946.4s)]
*  and also now dying. But you know, I wish you would have brought up Argentinian history [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=953.6s)]
*  with a bad empanada. Why it's not my field of expertise at all. I'm not very knowledgeable [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  on that stuff, but anyway, yeah, we, we had a, we had a fun conversation last night that was very [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=964.0799999999999s)]
*  instructive. Guess what? I was right. Of course it didn't turn into, as you may have guessed, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=970.4s)]
*  it did not turn into a heated debate at all. And it was more so just like clarifying my positions. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=978.72s)]
*  So he has a better understanding of them, my positions. I mean, Reddit is saying you destroyed [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=987.12s)]
*  your career by talking to them. Yeah, that's Reddit. They're Reddit is a bunch of natsec losers who [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=992.72s)]
*  don't even get paychecks from the federal government. Like it's people LARPing as though [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1000.08s)]
*  they work at Langley. Who cares? And that's not even like all of Reddit. That's just unique [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1006.08s)]
*  subreddits comprised of neck beards. Oh no, I can't believe Reddit said this, but yeah, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1013.12s)]
*  it was mostly just like, it was mostly a very, it was a delightful back and forth. Ultimately, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1019.6s)]
*  I don't think that, I mean, I, I, I don't think that those differences in the way that people [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1027.44s)]
*  carry themselves are all too consequential, all too significant, which is why I don't engage in [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1032.8s)]
*  the practice of left bashing at all, which is why I was even worried about bringing up any of my [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1037.28s)]
*  disagreements with bad empanada. Cause like, I just don't think it's, it's productive. Having said that [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1044.88s)]
*  it's good. I'm glad that we, we had that conversation. Hopefully some of the Hassan [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1052.16s)]
*  Abih heads who also happen to be bad empanada heads will now shut the fuck up and stop being [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1058.24s)]
*  annoying in my chat and vice versa. What is this? Just bad timing. They probably won't. I think [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1062.88s)]
*  they'll at most they'll say bad empanada is being a pussy or something and not, and wasn't aggressive [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1070.56s)]
*  enough to attack me or something like that. But, but yeah, not only was it a productive back and [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1077.84s)]
*  forth, but also lots of money was raised so far. I believe it's around 330,000 or something, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1083.04s)]
*  which is good. 320,000 hell yeah. For onra love that you look like you had fun talking about [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1092.32s)]
*  empanada. I mean, I bad empanada is like, is similar to someone like Felix Biederman. I think [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1098.56s)]
*  Felix is funnier, but he's, he has a very, and I love Felix as you guys know. And so it's not, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1104.48s)]
*  why would it be in any way, shape or form remotely different? Like why would that [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1113.28s)]
*  conversation go any different? Think about who some of my favorite, think about who some of my [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1118.08s)]
*  friends are in this left media sphere. Think about who some of my favorite people are. Some of my [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1123.68s)]
*  favorite people to collaborate with are in this left media sphere. Like they're not, they say [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1130.4s)]
*  things that are, I think way edgier than what bad empanada does in general. No, I'm talking about [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1135.2s)]
*  like not political adjacent. I'm talking directly in the political commentary sphere, like brace and, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1140.88s)]
*  and, and Felix and like the chopper orbit in general, even Noah, Noah is definitely a lot [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1148.4s)]
*  softer. But someone said, someone said Adam Friedland, no, Adam Friedland. I, I think Adam [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1154.72s)]
*  Friedland has a decent political framework or decent fundamentals, but he's, I wouldn't consider [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1162.32s)]
*  him a political commentator. He's a comedian, but yeah, learning about Drew Pavlov's background was [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1168.96s)]
*  the best part. Oh yeah. He's nutting. He's nutting over, he's nutting over being mentioned. I think [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1174.48s)]
*  he was like talking in all sincerity about how he really thinks that like, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1180.88s)]
*  I want to enslave his child or something. The irony of course is that he will never have a child [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1187.92s)]
*  because that would require him to have sex with a woman, which we all know is never going to happen. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1194.24s)]
*  So I don't think he needs to worry about that. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-KJzzLjGXk&t=1199.2s)]
