# The Shocking MAGA Couple Footage | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4)
*  better off now than probably when y'all loved it. 1800 on a 1700 when you don't like it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=0.0s)]
*  1950s. Oh, that's bro. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=6.0s)]
*  Speaker 0.(1h 1m 2s): Lasered in on it, dude. Hey, there's a perfect part. You know, we're [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  still running on that war economy. Okay. We're still running on that war economy. You got [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=12.8s)]
*  the GI bill, you know, white picket fence and all. Let's watch the shocking maga couple [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=17.6s)]
*  video that everyone is talking about. It was him going to the time and showing the ability [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=28.82s)]
*  to love people through even lifestyles that Christianity would say are wrong. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=34.1s)]
*  No, you're wrong because what does Jesus say in the Bible? He says, go and let the dead [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=38.34s)]
*  bury the dead. This man wanted to follow Jesus. And he said, I have to go give a funeral to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=43.06s)]
*  my father. He just died. And he said, no, let the dead bury the dead. Come and follow [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=47.58s)]
*  me. He didn't even let, he didn't even let, he told that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=52.34s)]
*  He doesn't refute what I'm saying. I'm saying don't ignore all the stories of Jesus being [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=54.7s)]
*  woke for the time. Wait, what? Jesus was the biggest wokester of the time. He's right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=60.14s)]
*  No, he was loving. He was, he was a servant publicly. Why can I see y'all talking about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=66.62s)]
*  the importance of loving? Do you actually believe this election would be so much better [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=72.62s)]
*  if women couldn't vote? I think every election, there's that joke. No. Even women in the 1920s [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=76.10000000000001s)]
*  When you look at the woman, what is going on? What this man said? Yeah, no, I firmly don't [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=82.1s)]
*  think women should be voting. Bitch, how about you? Maybe this woman shouldn't be voting. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=88.42s)]
*  But what about you? You shouldn't be voting either. Oh my God. Okay. I like this. This [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  is hogwatch. This is hogwatch. I like it. I like why people enjoyed watching this. I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=101.02s)]
*  get it. Open the schools. And suffrage movement and abolish homeschooling. But they did. They [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=106.78s)]
*  uh, they there was there were two sides. Women were advocating for for women not to get into [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=117.5s)]
*  politics. But see people, sure. Some women were no, not some. There were a lot like her. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=124.5s)]
*  No, there were a lot of people. Okay, not that old. Okay. People like to talk about [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=129.3s)]
*  my age. Oh my gosh. What a misogynistic thing to say. Take it back. I'm sorry. The use of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=132.38s)]
*  the day. Okay. The use of the day. I'm saying. But there were literally women who did not [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=138.62s)]
*  want women to get into politics. I'm sure there are a lot of really incorrect. Do you [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=143.66s)]
*  explore and you read about them? Do you read about why? Do you would you guess as to why [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=147.7s)]
*  probably had similar VC all but guess why they didn't want women to go into politics? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  I don't know the self hating something like that. Self hating. Yeah. No, it's because [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=156.66s)]
*  they love their families. They love having children. They want to. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Why can't you vote and love your family and having children? What? This doesn't even make [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  any sense. Bruh. This does not. This does not make any f**king sense whatsoever, dude. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  What is happening? Okay. Hold on one second. I gotta change. I gotta change my fit. I gotta [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=175.92s)]
*  get into my gym fit. Voting takes 60 hours a week. Obviously can't do that and have a baby. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=182.6s)]
*  Yeah. Also, does this mean that men hate their families because they vote? Is that what that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=187.4s)]
*  means? There it is again. Then be with your family. That's your choice. But why do you [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=193.32s)]
*  insist on making other people's choices for them? Do you know that there is a mass freedom, baby? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=198.84s)]
*  Do you know that women voting is not freedom, bro? But by saying women should. He's so committed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  He's like, stupid. This is amazing. They vote. And I know this is what you believe. And I don't know. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  These are the kinds of people who would be caught by mousetraps. Bro, you could jiggle some keys in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=214.76s)]
*  front of these guys and they would be entertained for a week, okay? If I would ever change your [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=218.44s)]
*  view on this. But it's like the biggest, most simple way to put men and women on such a different. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. Like value. You're valuing them wildly different. And it's still equality. Where in, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=229.48s)]
*  no. Where in reality, of course women who are part of society, who are equal citizens, who are equal [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  people should be having a say in their democracy. Democracy is cringe. It's mob rule. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=241.96s)]
*  Yo, this is exactly the type of sentiment that make me completely understand why the monarchy [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=255.24s)]
*  existed for as long as it did. Bro, if you have been living under at least theoretical democracy [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=264.76s)]
*  and have been taught that this is a good value to hold in 2024. So like for at least [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=271.32s)]
*  a couple hundred years, if not at least for 100 years, okay? And even in that process in [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  the United States of America, obviously like we didn't really let a lot of other people vote, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=284.28s)]
*  but like, you know, it's been around for a while at this point. And like the theory of it all [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=288.6s)]
*  is good, right? The theory in theory, it's good. It's something that we are aspiring towards. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=293.8s)]
*  And there are still people that are like, it's mob rule. Okay. Okay. I get it. No, I get it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=300.68s)]
*  I understand how people were just like, no, you don't understand. My Lord knows what's best for me. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=307.8s)]
*  My Lord, oi, Magna Carta has pretty cringe, governor. My Lordship knows what's best for the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=313.16s)]
*  grain. He knows how to best use it. My, my peasant brain cannot comprehend. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=322.76s)]
*  Me Lord, I will toil the land for you. Me Lordship, the peasant speaker of an uprising. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=330.68s)]
*  I'm here to tell you, I'm here to let you know, me Lord. I am selfish in your divine right to rule. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=338.28s)]
*  Oh, I haven't done them a Lord character in a minute, dude. Shouts out to these [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=348.2s)]
*  f**king dildos for bringing it back in a big way. Oh, that's amazing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=354.92s)]
*  I used to think slavery, the majority of people in this country used to think slavery. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=364.12s)]
*  Trump got the popular vote. It's true. Trump, the majority of the people in this country [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=368.92s)]
*  used to think slavery. What was good? Yeah. There was a democratic, there was a democratic [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  establishment over the preservation of slavery. That's awesome. No, they didn't. And you know, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=378.11999999999995s)]
*  who also didn't think it was good? The slaves who, every time we have this conversation, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=383.88s)]
*  we always talk about, this is one of the things that has always been so cringy for me in particular [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=389.55999999999995s)]
*  reading about American history and like trying to understand how Americans look at their own f**king [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=395.55999999999995s)]
*  personal history. It's, it's always been very frustrating. Something that is taught in American [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=399.64s)]
*  schools always is like, well, there was spirited debate about whether slavery should happen or not [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=405.56s)]
*  amongst the founders. And it's like, Oh, okay. I guess that's fine. Then like, are we in 2024 [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  still operating on the basis that like back then the human beings that were enslaved were not real [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=418.44s)]
*  human beings? Like what the f**k? Yeah. All right. Cool. I guess they had a spirited debate. The f**k [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=425.64s)]
*  does that, what difference does that f**king make? Like, what do you mean? I'm sure the people that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  were enslaved were not fond of it. Okay. And it's no longer, it's no longer 1776. Okay. So you know [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=437.64s)]
*  better, you know that they were human beings that were being enslaved. So why are we just like, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=446.68s)]
*  not thinking about their perspective on the matter? Very frustrating. Also, the founders [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=451.56s)]
*  had spirited debates over this matter is also silly because even in f**king, even in Pennsylvania, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=457.56s)]
*  there were restrictions on slavery. There were abolition rules in places where, for example, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=463.88s)]
*  George Washington lived. And in order to avoid those rules, George Washington fully knew that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=469.56s)]
*  it was immoral and f**ked up. He would traffic his own slaves outside of the state, six months [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=473.88s)]
*  at a time to avoid the six month period where after six months you were forced to free the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=480.52s)]
*  people that you were enslaving. So he would just cycle them out of the f**king state. So there was [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  already established laws around this sort of thing. So clearly enough people f**king knew it was bad. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=493.08s)]
*  Okay. Including, but not limited to, George f**king Washington. Okay. He knew it was bad too. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=500.2s)]
*  And he didn't give a f**k. Yeah. He was, he was hitting loopholes. He's like, he thought it was sick. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  Hey, is the democracy king at the moment? So that's great. But at the end of the day, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=513.88s)]
*  like if there were a room full of people that thought like me and Isabella, you would hate [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=519.56s)]
*  democracy too, wouldn't you? There have been majorities and we worked through our democracy [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=524.68s)]
*  to convince people. No, I want to hate democracy. Really? That's how things were before. And then [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=530.68s)]
*  we use our democracy to make the country better. I just better metrics are better off now than [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=534.36s)]
*  probably when y'all loved it. 1800 on a 1700 when you don't like it. 1950s. Oh, that's bro [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  lasered in on it, dude. Hey, there's a perfect part. You know, we're still running on that war [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=545.48s)]
*  economy. Okay. We're still running on that war economy. You got the GI bill, you know, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=551.08s)]
*  white picket fence and all pretty solid time for America. Also, I don't know if he knows this, but [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=557.08s)]
*  women could vote in the 1950s, but I guess he doesn't know much at all. So yeah. If you ask him, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=564.2800000000001s)]
*  ask him what he thinks about the top marginal tax rate and cook his brain. Okay. Fry his brain be [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=571.6400000000001s)]
*  like, Oh, what did you think of the top marginal tax rate in the 1950s? He's going to be like, Oh, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=579.48s)]
*  I don't know. He'd be like, Oh, it was 90%. You think that was solid. I do. Let's bring it back. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=584.2800000000001s)]
*  Time to be alive. Yeah. Come on. Seriously, including like the oppression of black people [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=589.88s)]
*  and stuff. Oh, Oh, wow. Yo, bring back shame. Don't even open the schools. I take it back. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=594.84s)]
*  Shame is an important tool here. I think. Wow. Wow. Yo, it's like that one chick that was debating [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=602.2s)]
*  Dean on the Nelk Boys podcast who just straight up said it like, what is happening? My man says [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=609.96s)]
*  segregation is not bad. What the Malcolm X. The reason why I wore the Malcolm X t-shirt is [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=616.84s)]
*  because Malcolm X wanted black communities, black government, black politics. That's what he wanted. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=622.52s)]
*  And I agree with more not Malcolm X's. I'm okay. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No. What is [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=628.9200000000001s)]
*  that guy saying? Why is the liberal saying shitting on Malcolm X? The liberal is taking the false [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  framing of Malcolm X's legacy and ideology from the mega hat wearing guy who just said [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=642.76s)]
*  segregation isn't that bad. Why would you ever fuck liberalism is such a brain rotted, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=649.4000000000001s)]
*  stupid fucking concept that he literally just heard a man who is so fucking stupid [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=657.0s)]
*  that he is anti-democracy and said segregation isn't bad. But now you're taking for granted what [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=664.44s)]
*  he just said about Malcolm X. Why the fuck? Why the fuck would you ever listen to that [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=670.6s)]
*  illiterate dipshit and find yourself in agreement with an illiterate dipshit that you have brought [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=677.5600000000001s)]
*  onto your show to make fun of him? Malcolm X rebuked his early segregation, his views, anyone [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=683.72s)]
*  with even a passing knowledge of his legacy would know that liberals are so useless. Yeah, I just, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=688.36s)]
*  he's operating on the classic. He's operating on the classic like, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  like, you know, Malcolm X was violent and scary. And MLK was peaceful and a liberal, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=696.84s)]
*  you know, the American government packed up both of them, by the way, didn't really matter. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=705.0s)]
*  And also both legacy are tarnished regardless. They're lied about endlessly. MLK was not a fucking [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=709.72s)]
*  liberal. Okay. His methods certainly were more peaceful, even though currently today when people [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=716.12s)]
*  apply those same peaceful methods, people do not have such a peaceful reaction to that, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=722.76s)]
*  you know, just to think about all of the boycotts or divestment initiatives that have occurred in [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=726.92s)]
*  the past year or so. Yeah. And okay. It was a whole lot closer to Malcolm X than any of these [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=732.4399999999999s)]
*  fucking goobers on this podcast. Yeah. And also back then they didn't have such a peaceful reaction [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=737.48s)]
*  to Malcolm X's peaceful disobedience, peaceful means of civil disobedience either by the way, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=744.04s)]
*  just, oh, okay. Or a bunch of the civil rights advocates of the day who understood [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=749.88s)]
*  segregation, the whole separate but equal fallacy is just that a fallacy. That's just a way to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=756.68s)]
*  allow for less resources, less rights to go to certain communities. You first have to isolate [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=764.04s)]
*  them and then you oppress them. But that's like very anti-democracy of you. If black people came [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=768.4399999999999s)]
*  together and they had decided that they wanted black communities, they had to- Neither MLK nor [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=772.36s)]
*  Malcolm X were liberals. Okay. MLK was not, Martin Luther King was not a liberal. He was not. I [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=778.28s)]
*  don't know how else to describe this other than he was not. He was very much an anti-imperialist. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=784.68s)]
*  He was very aggressively an advocate for, I mean, he did the Poor People's Campaign. Like he's not, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=790.1999999999999s)]
*  he was a socialist. Decided that that's what they wanted. They did it though. No whites got together. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=797.48s)]
*  In who were they unifying with? There we go. Huh? Yeah, exactly. Americans. And if you have [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=804.84s)]
*  black people who choose to associate with one another, and for example, their whole friend [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=811.96s)]
*  group is black, that's very different than as you mentioned. I agree. Yeah. I agree. Lawful [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=816.44s)]
*  segregation. I think lawful segregation- Or even advocating segregation. They do choose to segregate. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=820.36s)]
*  Right. This is something that they choose to- As time has gone on, people have been less and less [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=825.16s)]
*  segregated. There's like segregated month, Skate Pride month, that was American month. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=829.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. You're right. Gay pride month. That's a segregated month. No straights allowed [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=834.36s)]
*  during gay pride month. Everybody knows that she's an African-American month. Yeah. That's funny. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=841.64s)]
*  That's funny when they're being woke while also being racist. I love when races try to be woke. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=846.76s)]
*  It's my favorite thing. I can't, I can't keep watching this video. I mean, I want to, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=852.2s)]
*  I really, really want to, I just don't have time to keep watching this video. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=856.6800000000001s)]
*  Um, we're going to be watching. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8dEPAUO-4&t=860.84s)]
