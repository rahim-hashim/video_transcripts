*  Okay. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=184.96s)]
*  It's literally a minute delay for some, for some. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=185.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=189.96s)]

*  There's still, there only a couple of people are one minute delayed and there's still, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=194.96s)]
*  Oh, now it started. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=199.96s)]
*  It's almost two minutes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=200.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=202.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=204.96s)]
*  What the is happening, bro? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=206.96s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=209.96s)]
*  How the hell you have to restart your stream. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=211.96s)]
*  I warned you about this yesterday. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=214.96s)]
*  It's like 30 seconds delayed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=215.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=217.96s)]
*  I'm not going to restart the stream, dude. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=218.96s)]
*  If anything, I'm just going to end the stream. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=219.96s)]
*  If that's the case. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=221.96s)]
*  Every one of us has to serve three years in the army, two years in the army, some of us, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=222.96s)]
*  five years. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=227.96s)]
*  And then for the rest of our lives, you have got to serve two or three years in the army of words. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=228.96s)]
*  You've got to learn to fight the political battle, which is even more important at this point than the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=233.96s)]
*  military battle that we are. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=239.96s)]
*  We'll fight the military battle. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=241.96s)]
*  We're not asking you necessarily to come and be lone soldiers. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=243.96s)]
*  Although some of you can, you've got to learn how to fight back on the campuses, how to make the arguments. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=246.96s)]
*  Now they keep shifting. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=253.96s)]
*  You know, the ground keeps shifting under us. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=255.96s)]
*  They keep changing the language. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  Intersectionality wasn't even a word 10 years ago. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  Now suddenly it's intersectionality. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  You've got to stay on top of it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  And you know how we train for the army? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  We don't train for defensive warfare. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  If the war against Israel, on Israeli soil, do I have to tell you? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  It's an impossibility. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  So it's the same thing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  Don't let the war of words ever be fought about Israel's nature. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=283.96s)]
*  Let it be fought about why you can't accept Israel, why you have to single out this tiny people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=288.96s)]
*  Try to find Israel on the map. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=295.96s)]
*  It's hardly there. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=297.96s)]
*  You know, we used to play this game where this is a famous Hasbarist. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=298.96s)]
*  OK, I've I've I've played this video before. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=302.96s)]
*  I've played this video on the stream before. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=307.96s)]
*  This is an old Hassan Abiy classic. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGwlo7UMiI&t=309.96s)]
