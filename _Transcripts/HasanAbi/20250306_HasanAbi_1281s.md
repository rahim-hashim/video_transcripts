# SpaceX Faces Issues In Its Latest Launch | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA)
*  It was refusing takeoff as long as the last one shit the bed before Elon was in power though [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=0.0s)]
*  Starship test flight 8 appeared to have suffered an anomaly video taken from the cruise ship in the Florida Straits [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=6.3s)]
*  flights diverting away from the active debris field in Bahamas. Oh, this is this is happening in real time. Is that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=11.16s)]
*  The second and six may have done their work on try to align themselves with where the booster was coming down [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=23.32s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=30.4s)]
*  Yeah, this is I think we saw maybe maybe I'm maybe I'm imagining things [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=33.0s)]
*  But I think we saw the chopsticks almost pivoting over at the catch. I we will have to wait for [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=39.44s)]
*  Rewind what happened it blew up before it could I think we go out to NASA spaceflight.com [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=46.28s)]
*  You can join the forum join what we call L2 and we have some amazing writers that write articles that keep [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=53.04s)]
*  You up with all the things [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=59.44s)]
*  Will be coming off [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=62.16s)]
*  Lots of ways for you to join the NSF is this rocket nerd family. This is a great tracking any issues [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=65.0s)]
*  You know [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=71.96s)]
*  Complete opposite of what happened on Monday, right around this time [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=74.56s)]
*  We had that the triple hole call on the countdown and it was like it's normal. It's cooling. That's that's bad [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=77.44s)]
*  So we don't want that to happen today and so far it's looking like everything there is but you know knocking wood [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=82.92s)]
*  You know, one of the big questions we get is where can we come to everybody knocking on their head? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=88.84s)]
*  That's funny. Where can we come and watch the long go to the T? Okay. I'll go to the launch is 12 minutes [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=93.76s)]
*  seconds from now the chat a different plans go for it and get to the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=101.36s)]
*  If they are going through that once that is confirmed, it's like they're holding [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=106.84s)]
*  They just troubleshoot a few minutes and once they are confident once everything looks good. They will will progress [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=111.92s)]
*  This is not oh [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=117.96s)]
*  I saw the vent on the side [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  Which means they're probably releasing the hold [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  There's the DSS I think [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=126.0s)]
*  That's the Tunisian suppression system. Yeah [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and at this point we will be quiet see you on the other side [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  What [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=143.44s)]
*  I [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=147.96s)]
*  It's so phallic yes, you can skip three minutes at least [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  So [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=167.84s)]
*  It just starts flying pitching down range away from that and the booster [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=174.56s)]
*  Send we are I mean I like so far so far so good, right? We are everything good. We are that hot [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  Turn [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=193.44s)]
*  Yeah, everything looking good here on the Raptor and on the left [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=194.72s)]
*  Minute minutes in the flight you can see a blow go for cat [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=199.36s)]
*  Yeah, I go for booster catch no no that's normal that's a booster booster falling [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's the booster falling into the chopsticks in the child. Oh, yeah, they are they look at that glow Alex [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=209.5s)]
*  Fantastic that's so cool [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=216.84s)]
*  Engines to ignite and then they will shut down all but free for the final approach to the tower [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's see what happens [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=225.4s)]
*  What did they have so let's see Lindenborn [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Beautiful flame trial flutter of flamethrower. I'm sorry. There it is. There are the engines [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=232.28s)]
*  Loud oh is a test flight you got baited by chat. I mean, it's still important. Wake up chat chat wake up [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=240.4s)]
*  I mean, this is still by the way an unimaginably impressive create [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  It is an incredibly impressive feat of technology like technological advancements the fact that they can like reuse boosters is crazy [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=250.56s)]
*  Spacings of Blue Origin have launched dozens of test payloads with no details, but they're all huge and stay in orbit [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=259.64s)]
*  It's not a pointless money pit at all. You're wrong [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=264.52s)]
*  I [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=266.7s)]
*  Lost contact with the rocket but the booster thing I mean isn't the booster thing what they're mainly caring about [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=276.14s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah, there's no I don't think there's like any I don't think there is any payload unless like they work [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  It would be an issue if they were also carrying humans [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  Engines back not on the boostback burn and also some unsurance and they are still committing for this Alex [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=297.7s)]
*  Whoo, that's that was interesting. This is where it goes wrong. Wow. I [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=305.7s)]
*  Am I am honestly impressed. Oh wait, no, that's probably just [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=313.38s)]
*  All right [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=317.34s)]
*  That's not nominal [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=323.73999999999995s)]
*  That doesn't look nominal. Yeah, I'm so confused. Why are people finding this shit so novel? It's the catch [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=325.85999999999996s)]
*  It's the catching mechanism that's novel and the successfully being able to do it over and over again. That's novel [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  They've been doing it for like a year now, but it's still new [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=336.26s)]
*  So we're still looks getting video down rather interesting several engines and we've lost attitude control of tumbling [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=339.58s)]
*  This is the second launch in a row [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=347.38s)]
*  They've lost altitude control of the ship it rotating is normally wants to rotate and point in the other direction so we can slow [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=348.5s)]
*  down [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=353.82s)]
*  Sorry, I mean there are some rocket science in my community [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=359.94s)]
*  Yeah, no, there are definitely rocket science in my community. My brother could do this as well [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=364.73999999999995s)]
*  That's what I'm hearing. Nobody could do this [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=369.97999999999996s)]
*  Successful liftoff of the test flight of Starship followed by a successful a successful stage separation [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=372.22s)]
*  We saw the booster actually you can see it just behind us here. The booster had a successful catch back at the tower [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=379.18s)]
*  Unfortunately, it seems as though we lost the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  The attitude control of the ship we are standing by as we listen in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=390.54s)]
*  I know she's saying altitude control, but I just heard attitude control information. We're able to provide you [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=395.44000000000005s)]
*  We will provide that as soon as we are able but it's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=400.16s)]
*  Pretty incredible to take a moment and see the booster just behind us [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=404.6s)]
*  Certainly a different view than last time and at this point we've essentially lost contact with the ship [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  We're no longer receiving telemetry at this moment [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=414.56s)]
*  So we were only 20 seconds away or so from the end of that. This kind of looks like he's got the as mingle [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  phenotype [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=425.12s)]
*  Attitude control and so we did see but he looks healthier [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=427.12s)]
*  This is what would happen if as mingle [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=433.08s)]
*  Sounds like him today, but just give us a couple more minutes. We'll bring you more information. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah based [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=440.56s)]
*  Well, that was fun to watch from the roof [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=448.68s)]
*  It was not fun to watch controls correct you mean they can't aim it not control his altitude [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=450.68s)]
*  It's coming down either way, but I can't control that attitude. It's gonna smack the shit out of the atmosphere and blow up. I [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=456.08s)]
*  Mean [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=463.24s)]
*  What looks like I love learning four engines went out early [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=464.24s)]
*  That's almost looked like we had [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=470.4s)]
*  Four engines out a bit early and that started it blowed up because of course [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=473.48s)]
*  That will no that's not true asymmetric thrust [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=478.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's not from this time in the asymmetric frost. You're basically starting to tumble and so we were all [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=481.0s)]
*  This oh [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=491.96s)]
*  Similar to what happened on flight 7 on the way. We don't know the reasons why obviously but yeah the the inner three [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=492.96s)]
*  engines can gimbal the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  Vacuum optimizer Raptors look at that beautiful ship hanging off the chopsticks booster [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=503.68s)]
*  They they are fixed right so the vacuum optimizer they if they have to do [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  massive attitude control [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=512.9200000000001s)]
*  maneuvers they do them with the sea level engines and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=515.16s)]
*  As soon as you know one engine out they can still control it, but two engines out [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=518.4s)]
*  One sea level just just can't handle it and it will go into as you say asymmetric [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  Thrust which will start the vehicle tumbling. I just caught a bit of that as I came back into the studio [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=527.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's of course we are standing by for SpaceX to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=534.2800000000001s)]
*  Say more and like give us a good [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=539.6400000000001s)]
*  overview of what happens [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=543.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=547.0s)]
*  there's [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=548.36s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=549.36s)]
*  I think [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=550.72s)]
*  Sorry, I think [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=552.72s)]
*  I think [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=554.84s)]
*  Sorry, I was gonna say there's at least some things that we do are sure [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=556.32s)]
*  If it was refusing takeoff is launched because the last one shit the bed before Elon was in power though [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=560.72s)]
*  Starship test flight 8 appeared to have suffered an anomaly video taken from the cruise ship in the Florida Straits [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=567.2s)]
*  flights diverting away from the active debris field in Bahamas [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=572.08s)]
*  Oh, this is this is happening in real time [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  Is that if lights beginning to divert away from the Starship? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=578.48s)]
*  Starships active debris field password told it would be holding for approximately 90 minutes. That's crazy [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=581.84s)]
*  Under DEI. Yeah, that's what I mean. Yeah rocket would have made it these planes would be going where they don't have [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=588.84s)]
*  No, they don't have anybody will be fine gay people. Wokeness is gone. And so we lost it [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=594.52s)]
*  Yeah, I see that I see that and I hear that and I believe that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=601.12s)]
*  Please hold space for it. Yeah [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=605.36s)]
*  We need to do more bodies and more gay bodies in spaces [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  Literally in space right that we can talk about here [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=611.76s)]
*  That booster looks a little bit off from what we saw on previous landings [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=616.72s)]
*  You may see may notice that it's actually served to the side of the tower. That is not how it landed [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=622.04s)]
*  Oh [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=628.0799999999999s)]
*  Is that it which means the? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  Chopsticks may have done their work on try to align themselves with where the booster was coming down [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=632.4s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=639.24s)]
*  This is I think we saw maybe maybe I'm maybe I'm [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=641.56s)]
*  imagining things but I think we saw the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=647.1999999999999s)]
*  Chopsticks almost pivoting over at the catch. I we will have to wait for replays [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=649.28s)]
*  and [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=655.84s)]
*  We will have to wait and see for that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=657.12s)]
*  But I think we we saw a rapid movement of the chopsticks right before the catch to get get the booster [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=659.0s)]
*  But I mean good. Let's talk about the successful part here first. Yep. They caught another booster [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=666.28s)]
*  That's that's the good part here [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=671.0s)]
*  Coming back with you real quick. So can confirm we did lose contact with [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=673.88s)]
*  To so we've no practice at this now we it's not nighttime a lot of measures in place like debris response [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=680.84s)]
*  coordinate very closely [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=688.4399999999999s)]
*  55 p.m. Over there and it's not daylight saving. Yeah, I don't know [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=689.64s)]
*  Wait that one, but that's I mean that's fake. This one is real. Yeah, it's not no, I don't think that's real [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=693.6s)]
*  But it's a cool video. Yeah, I love that Twitter is the media now. It's so great [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=700.46s)]
*  Yeah, I love I love that you are the media now chat. Okay, which means you know, yeah a whole bunch of fake shit [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=705.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=713.6600000000001s)]
*  Once upon a time there was like three guys in a control room with like, you know [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=714.0600000000001s)]
*  50 years of experience between them working in like the belly of NBC and now there's a sons chat. Yeah [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=717.2800000000001s)]
*  or or like [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=723.1s)]
*  The your neighbor that you feel uncomfortable around with a blue checkmark account on Twitter, you know [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=724.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's the guy that's the guy [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=731.6800000000001s)]
*  Guy who's been asked politely to leave for more events than he can count guy who's like [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=734.32s)]
*  Guy who you've noticed is like acting real creepy around your daughter's friends, you know [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=739.24s)]
*  That guy has an account with 300,000 followers and he's constantly pumping AI videos on their traffic control [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=745.4s)]
*  We have a lot of measures put before we ever launch a rocket to make sure that we're keeping the public safe those work [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=752.24s)]
*  Last time and they're actively in work right now [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=758.24s)]
*  So just to recap real quick everything we saw we lifted off right at the top of our window [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=761.4000000000001s)]
*  Essentially at 5 30 p.m [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=766.9200000000001s)]
*  Central time booster was able to get us all the way up into space dog saying the booster is fine is ridiculous [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=768.24s)]
*  The entire point of this is to have a successful [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=774.72s)]
*  payload mission so that you can [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=777.6400000000001s)]
*  Inevitably put things in it and then inevitably put humans in it [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=780.64s)]
*  Obviously if you can't if it fucking spirals out of control, then yeah, no, this was a failure and it's fine [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=784.4000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, it's never going to be [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=791.5200000000001s)]
*  100% [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=794.6800000000001s)]
*  There's you're gonna fail a million times until you succeed. It's just a normal part of the process of scientific discovery [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  Normal part of these sorts of technological advancements in general [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=803.4000000000001s)]
*  I do not think that this is a waste of time or resources at all [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=807.04s)]
*  Having said that however, fuck Elon Musk, obviously that's number one and I will be actively searching for reasons [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=810.6s)]
*  That's the why he is single-handedly responsible for the failure of this mission [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=817.6s)]
*  Because I am a petty bitch. I already have my answer. They took out the payload is the easy part [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=822.04s)]
*  That's why they didn't bother making it work for this launch. Wait, what do you mean? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=826.4s)]
*  No, the entire point of this is so that the fucking payload [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=829.4s)]
*  They can actively show that the payload doesn't turn into debris. Oh, I'm fucking around. Okay [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=833.28s)]
*  Because like in the past there yeah, they the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=841.84s)]
*  Initial goal was to make sure that the boosters can return and be reused. That's a huge deal [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=845.16s)]
*  some major cost-saving initiative as well and eventually you could technically have it on [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=850.72s)]
*  Other areas like maybe on other planets maybe in the future [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=856.6800000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like something crazy like that some real sci-fi shit [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=860.16s)]
*  Have it on the moon build a fucking moon base. What do we do with it though? What's on the moon that we need? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=864.12s)]
*  That's never been made clear to me and I saw the movie moon and it didn't answer that either [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=869.84s)]
*  I think is cool to just go there chill. I agree. It's cool to go there [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=873.64s)]
*  I just don't know if it's like I need to like like, you know, what what's also interesting about that actually? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=878.2s)]
*  ironically enough is that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=885.6s)]
*  In the process of failing during the scientific discovery during the technological advancements that are being implemented [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=887.4s)]
*  You get a lot of new tech that you can use that turned into like, you know commercialized commodities, right? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=893.4399999999999s)]
*  Space missions are good for that. Well, yeah like velcro [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=900.6s)]
*  Yeah, like the I've brought the one to bring up that like it comes out of the space program and yeah [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=903.16s)]
*  I'm Terry research or whatever and it's and it's interesting because it's interesting because like, you know [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=907.88s)]
*  Should know better than to constantly advocate to cut NIH funding for example a guy who fails all the fucking time [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=913.2s)]
*  Elon Musk. Yeah, but you see the NIH. Yeah. Yeah [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=922.08s)]
*  Like that's what me that's what pisses me off so much like a fucking billionaire [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=926.32s)]
*  Who is only around because of government subsidies turning around and being like government and that we should cut my taxes more [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=930.8s)]
*  pisses me off [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=937.92s)]
*  It pisses me off so much like you are such a piece of shit dude [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=940.24s)]
*  you are such a goddamn piece of shit a guy who's like made his entire career around renewable energies and then [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=943.8199999999999s)]
*  And then turning around and being like yeah [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=951.12s)]
*  I know I'm actually lined up with the most [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=952.9599999999999s)]
*  Like pro fossil fuel administration in recent history false narrative. It's not a false narrative. It's 100% correct [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=955.4s)]
*  Correct the record if you got anything. Okay, don't come in here and be like that's a false narrative. Just say what is false [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=962.64s)]
*  I hate this space X sucks bro. NASA does this cheaper and they know what they're doing spaces far more expensive on me against all-space privatization [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=968.36s)]
*  No, I I wish [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't Tesla have died without the government. Yes without the the the credits swap scheme that the government created [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=978.16s)]
*  Tesla would not have been subsidized [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=986.52s)]
*  Made its way back here. It's sitting on the tower right behind us our third ever catch [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=989.28s)]
*  Starship ignited all six of its Raptor engines. It was just about 20 or 30 seconds away [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=994.04s)]
*  We'll get exact times from the end of its ascent burn when we started to see some engines go out on ship [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=999.1800000000001s)]
*  eventually lost attitude control and then lost contact with the ship shortly after so [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1005.4s)]
*  Obviously a lot to go through a lot to dig through [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1011.12s)]
*  We're gonna go right at it [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1013.52s)]
*  The primary reason we do these flight tests is to learn we have some more to learn about this vehicle [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1015.28s)]
*  But we're gonna be right back here in the not too distant future and we're gonna get a ship to space [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1021.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right. We fly to learn and we're learning a lot and as is the case with developmental programs [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1025.86s)]
*  I wrote the Starship flight learn and we learned to fly [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1032.36s)]
*  So I was like right there close out our webcast for the day [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1035.36s)]
*  But before we do we'd like to give a shout out to our nerds brother fucking stem kids. What do you mean? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1039.1599999999999s)]
*  Don't explain to me poetic [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1045.2s)]
*  Yeah, the purpose of a moon base they use the moon as a launch pad for Mars is a cheaper launch zone for his lower [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1046.68s)]
*  Gravity that makes sense. But what the fuck are we gonna do in Mars? That's what I just [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1051.76s)]
*  They found water right they found ice in mine [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1057.72s)]
*  But it's like also like the like the time scale that like we get like terraform or do any of this stuff the resources required [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1060.24s)]
*  It's like how about we how about we figure out our shit down here first? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1067.22s)]
*  Like if we had had world communism by now [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1070.72s)]
*  Like maybe like maybe Mars would be I think we could do that if we had world [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1072.82s)]
*  Communism right now. Yeah, Gil Gil Scott her on over here [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1078.18s)]
*  Why are heron? Why are we fucking spending money on sending people to the moon? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1081.7s)]
*  spending people to space I [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1086.86s)]
*  Listen, I'm I am pro space exploration and I think it like rewards us and gives us stuff [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1089.34s)]
*  However, I also think that [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1095.04s)]
*  Like my ability to drive a car at 17. It's a privilege [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1097.98s)]
*  And you can earn that privilege with good behavior like world communist. Okay fair [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1102.82s)]
*  Alright, no, no more space exploration until we have a global homo [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1107.8999999999999s)]
*  Communism exactly. Yeah, if we actually have world communism, we'd absolutely at least have industry on the moon and in space on ironically [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1112.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think that I [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1120.22s)]
*  think [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1122.8999999999999s)]
*  actively the thing that sets this back the thing that holds us back consistently is [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1124.1s)]
*  The the interest of profit and the short-term [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1128.34s)]
*  profit-seeking behavior that [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1132.62s)]
*  Refuses that that gets in the way of [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1135.46s)]
*  Making exponential growth in the field of technological advancements. All right [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1138.9s)]
*  Israelis are doing a tick-tock trend mocking Palestinian children suffering. Let's take a look [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1144.26s)]
*  They call family members pretending to be a Palestinian charity raising donation for Gaza's children [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1151.94s)]
*  For Gaza's children [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1156.1399999999999s)]
*  Like this only works if you're you know locked in on a [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1168.62s)]
*  incredibly one-sided way of thinking about this conflict where you're just literally like saying the truth, but [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1174.06s)]
*  everybody everybody [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1180.9s)]
*  Interprets as you being like when I watch this I'm like, okay what you said is correct [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1182.42s)]
*  You know, but she's saying it in a mocking tone [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Da5B3u0TA&t=1188.5s)]
