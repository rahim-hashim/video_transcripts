# Hasan & Noah Walk Through New York City
**HasanAbi:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ)
*  He would not be... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  That's not what I mean. I 100% agree. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1.6s)]
*  When I say people though, what I don't mean is like the specific person of Zoran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4.3s)]
*  I mean that like it cannot be somebody who comes from the old way of doing things. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=9.5s)]
*  It can't be somebody with the last name Clinton. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=14.8s)]
*  It can't be somebody whose last job was in an Obama White House in politics. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=17.2s)]
*  I swapped it over to our camera. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=21.1s)]
*  Sweet. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=30.300000000000004s)]
*  I wonder how bad the rain is. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=38.3s)]
*  I don't think it's that bad. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=41.1s)]
*  So you still brought the light with you? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=45.7s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=47.3s)]
*  Oh, you got both, yeah. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=47.8s)]
*  And I have an umbrella here too if you guys want it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=50.1s)]
*  You want what? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=52.300000000000004s)]
*  I have an umbrella if you guys want it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=53.300000000000004s)]
*  It's a Chinese umbrella. It's cool. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=55.0s)]
*  It's a protective RFP. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  Alright, we're gonna get in the elevator so it might F for a second chat. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=60.1s)]
*  Let's see if it F'd. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=80.1s)]
*  People are already F-ing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=83.1s)]
*  People are already pressing F before we even get in the elevator. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=84.1s)]
*  Y'all are F. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=87.1s)]
*  Chat's been misbehaving. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=89.1s)]
*  They were, when you guys were talking about Israel-Palestine, they were just talking about me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=90.1s)]
*  Yeah, it was really funny. I glanced at it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=94.1s)]
*  I felt bad. I was like, guys, stop talking about me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=96.1s)]
*  Nah, they had their eye on the bride. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=99.1s)]
*  They understood what was going on. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=102.1s)]
*  I mean, you can show from here on out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=104.1s)]
*  You good now or? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=106.1s)]
*  Alright. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=108.1s)]
*  Come with me, chat. I'm protecting you from the rain. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=126.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, I think it's probably okay to show. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=131.1s)]
*  Oh god. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=135.1s)]
*  This camera's not waterproof. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=136.1s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=139.1s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=140.1s)]
*  No, that's good. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=141.1s)]
*  It's like water resistant. Like, it's fine. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=142.1s)]
*  Here, shit, who gets where? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=145.1s)]
*  All three of us can sit in the back. It's fine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=149.1s)]
*  You want to sit in the middle? I'll sit on the side so I can record both of you guys. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=151.1s)]
*  Are you good in the middle? Are you okay? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=154.1s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=156.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're good. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=158.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=160.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=165.1s)]
*  Um, we gotta figure out what to do with the kid marrow tomorrow. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=167.1s)]
*  He wants to... [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=171.1s)]
*  Oh, see, this is what I mean. It's like super dark. What do we do? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=173.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I'll fix it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=175.1s)]
*  I just gotta adjust the ISO. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=178.1s)]
*  These lights in the back here, no? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=182.1s)]
*  He could take you to the Bronx. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=185.1s)]
*  Do an IRL stream in the Bronx. That would be fun. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=188.1s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=193.1s)]
*  Yeah, make him take... Absolutely. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=194.1s)]
*  Suddenly rain. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=202.1s)]
*  What's up? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=205.1s)]
*  Suddenly rain. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=206.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, suddenly. It's crazy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=207.1s)]
*  I'm not from here, so I'm not used to it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=209.1s)]
*  I don't ever see rain. I live in LA. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=212.1s)]
*  Okay, but New York City weather is crazy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=215.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=220.1s)]
*  Like... [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=221.1s)]
*  The time, you know, is very hard. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=223.1s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=225.1s)]
*  I'm from Bangladesh. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=226.1s)]
*  Oh, you're from Bangladesh. Nice. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=227.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=229.1s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=230.1s)]
*  What is happening? You good? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=235.1s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out how much has it set up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=238.1s)]
*  I can't adjust the ISO. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=241.1s)]
*  How long have you been living in New York? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=243.1s)]
*  Almost 14 years. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=246.1s)]
*  Almost 14 years. Damn. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=248.1s)]
*  A long time. How do you love it? You like it? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=250.1s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. I like it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=253.1s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=255.1s)]
*  What do you think about Donald Trump? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=257.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=259.1s)]
*  Not great, huh? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=261.1s)]
*  No, not now my president. Obviously great. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=262.1s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, okay. Yeah. All right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=265.1s)]
*  That's chill. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=269.1s)]
*  He's the president. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=270.1s)]
*  Do you like the mayor, Eric Adams? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=271.1s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=274.1s)]
*  No, you don't like him? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=275.1s)]
*  No. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=276.1s)]
*  What do you think about Zoran? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=277.1s)]
*  Okay, but this is politically. But I have no politics, but Eddie Merak's, this is the... [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=279.1s)]
*  Look like two times the New York City mayor. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=289.1s)]
*  Good working, you know. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=295.1s)]
*  Wait, what did you say? You think Zoran Mamdani? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=296.1s)]
*  The new guy, yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=302.1s)]
*  I'll just turn this light on. I feel like that'll help. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=309.1s)]
*  Auto shooting, aperture, shutter speed are automatic. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=311.1s)]
*  This is what happens when you have March from Wish. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=314.1s)]
*  You didn't hear it now? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=317.1s)]
*  Fixed it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=319.1s)]
*  Sorry, Chad. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=320.1s)]
*  I fixed it here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=322.1s)]
*  I fixed it here. Hold on. And then this is how you... [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=323.1s)]
*  Does that mean you need T-Mulalo? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=327.1s)]
*  Wait, no. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=329.1s)]
*  ISO, oh, I bricked it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=332.1s)]
*  I mean, this is... Wait, turn it off for a second. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=336.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, there's no way. It's too dark. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=340.1s)]
*  No, change it to 12,800. It's like the second native ISO. It'll look clean. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=342.1s)]
*  Oh, wait, 20,000. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=348.1s)]
*  That should be fine. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=350.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=351.1s)]
*  It worked, I think. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=354.1s)]
*  Nice. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=358.1s)]
*  That's good. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=360.1s)]
*  It is good. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=362.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's working. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=363.1s)]
*  Sweet. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=365.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=370.1s)]
*  So much better, actually. You got it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=374.1s)]
*  Sweet. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=378.1s)]
*  I'm Turkish. I'm from Istanbul. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=382.1s)]
*  When... [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=392.1s)]
*  Remember when that Mexican boat hit the bridge? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=394.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=397.1s)]
*  So when that happened, I guess they didn't... [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=398.1s)]
*  They had to take the boat somewhere, so they tied it up right over here on the East River. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=402.1s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=407.1s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy to see, because it was all screwed up. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=408.1s)]
*  But there's a bunch of really pretty memorials for it. People left flowers and what have you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=413.1s)]
*  That was so sad. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=417.1s)]
*  It was really sad. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=418.1s)]
*  It's still not really clear to me why... [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=420.1s)]
*  Yeah, what happened? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=422.1s)]
*  Yeah, I still... [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=423.1s)]
*  There's like an electrical failure, I thought. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=424.1s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=426.1s)]
*  Yeah, the ship's navigation is like broke or something. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=427.1s)]
*  I'll be honest. When I see a ship like that, that's all old and wooden, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=431.1s)]
*  I have never assumed that there's modern parts on it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=436.1s)]
*  I just assumed that they're doing Pirates of the Caribbean on it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=439.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=442.1s)]
*  That it's just the same. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=443.1s)]
*  Like that they wouldn't have a GPS. They would say, like, Yarr and whatever. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=445.1s)]
*  Yeah. But Spanish. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=450.1s)]
*  But Spanish, you know. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=453.1s)]
*  What's Yarr in Spanish? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=454.1s)]
*  Yarr. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=455.1s)]
*  Yarr. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=456.1s)]
*  Yarr. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=457.1s)]
*  Yarr. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=458.1s)]
*  Well, they say, aye. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=462.1s)]
*  Aye, aye? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=464.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=465.1s)]
*  Is it crazy blowing up in the red? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=469.1s)]
*  I think maybe it's the ISO. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=471.1s)]
*  Wait, oh, I would... Hold on one second. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=473.1s)]
*  It's also the stoplight, the brake lights in front of us. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=476.1s)]
*  If I just... [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=478.1s)]
*  Like, directly is. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=479.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. Hold on. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=480.1s)]
*  I'm also... No, no, no. I'm fixing the focus too. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=482.1s)]
*  No, no, you don't have to turn that off. That's fine. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=485.1s)]
*  Okay. I think this works. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=490.1s)]
*  Did I fix the focus yet? I can't see. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=496.1s)]
*  Heavy bisexual lighting? Yeah, that's what we're going for. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=502.1s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=505.1s)]
*  I don't even know. I... [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=507.1s)]
*  You thought this was a D? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=509.1s)]
*  I didn't have, like, any sort of crazy plans lined up for IRO stuff, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=511.1s)]
*  but Eric has been kind enough to suggest, make some suggestions. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=515.1s)]
*  We might go to Vogue, right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=519.1s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=520.1s)]
*  On Thursday, but that leaves tomorrow open. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=521.1s)]
*  That's the only day that's open. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=524.1s)]
*  I'm going to do something with Brace. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=526.1s)]
*  Not sure exactly what I'm going to be doing, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=527.1s)]
*  but I was planning on maybe even taking Brace to meet up with Mero himself. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=529.1s)]
*  I feel like that could be fun. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=537.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's an interesting link and build. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=538.1s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=540.1s)]
*  What are you doing with Mero? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=541.1s)]
*  I haven't even figured it out yet. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=543.1s)]
*  He's just been... I texted him. I was like, let's link up and build. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=545.1s)]
*  I think you should go... I think Brox would be fun. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=549.1s)]
*  Okay. I said, yeah, I asked him, can we do an IRO stream in the Bronx? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=554.1s)]
*  Like historic Bronx spots. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=562.1s)]
*  That could be cool. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=565.1s)]
*  Bronx is cool. Arthur Avenue, the Joker stairs. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=567.1s)]
*  I mean, I'm obviously being a little bit corny there, but... [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=571.1s)]
*  Arthur Avenue, no, it would be cool. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=575.1s)]
*  It's a side of New York that more people, myself included, should know more about. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=579.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=583.1s)]
*  I've never... I've mostly been Manhattan, a little bit of Brooklyn. That's it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=585.1s)]
*  You went through Queens with Zoran, right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=590.1s)]
*  Yeah, that was my first time in Queens. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=592.1s)]
*  Queens is the best borough. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=594.1s)]
*  It was really nice. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=596.1s)]
*  Queens is cool. I'm a Manhattan supremacist, but... [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=597.1s)]
*  Ooh, classic. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=602.1s)]
*  I mean, Brooklyn is... I don't know. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=604.1s)]
*  It's... I think every borough in New York is pretty all right. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=608.1s)]
*  Even... [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=614.1s)]
*  Even... [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=615.1s)]
*  What? Staten Island? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=616.1s)]
*  The one we don't talk about. Yeah, Staten Island. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=617.1s)]
*  It's like... I mean, yeah, it's like, oh, like it's just like cops live there. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=620.1s)]
*  And it's like, that's true. That's literally true. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=624.1s)]
*  But it's fine. I mean, it's more or less like New Jersey, which is where I'm from. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=628.1s)]
*  Like, I couldn't in good faith rag on Staten Island when like I'm from like Sopranos land. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=633.1s)]
*  Yeah. Stalin Island. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=640.1s)]
*  Now there's Zoran. Yeah, Zoran. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=643.1s)]
*  Taking over. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=645.1s)]
*  That was... I think like that was the turning point for a lot of people, right? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=646.1s)]
*  Like when the Staten Island returns came in or the... or whatever it was. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=649.1s)]
*  That's when I realized that something is shifting in the air. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=652.1s)]
*  Noah, did you canvass for Zoran? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=657.1s)]
*  No, I did. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=659.1s)]
*  Bro, just lie. I can't believe it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=661.1s)]
*  I mean... You gotta say yes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=663.1s)]
*  No, because if you say yes, that's the like... I know. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=665.1s)]
*  But I did... I helped out with a fundraiser. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=667.1s)]
*  You know, donated like a very extremely modest amount of money, but like mainly... [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=672.1s)]
*  Mainly just pounded the digital pavement. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=678.1s)]
*  Yeah, he came as digitally. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=682.1s)]
*  That's... You're damn right. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=684.1s)]
*  He couldn't even get the coveted Adam Friedland endorsement though. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=686.1s)]
*  Yeah, what was up with that? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=690.1s)]
*  You talking about that? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=691.1s)]
*  Adam is anti-woke now. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=692.1s)]
*  He's actually like... [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=694.1s)]
*  He's taking taffs in kind of like a Jewish sharia sort of direction. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=698.1s)]
*  No, I think it's... [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=705.1s)]
*  He's linked up with the Cuomo's. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=707.1s)]
*  He's trying to get Andrew on taffs. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=710.1s)]
*  No, I think he's, you know, just... [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=714.1s)]
*  You know, like Papa John Schneider voice. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=717.1s)]
*  Wait and see. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=720.1s)]
*  Wait and see. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=721.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=722.1s)]
*  Just wait and see. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=723.1s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=725.1s)]
*  He's playing hard to get. That's what he's trying to do. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=726.1s)]
*  He's trying to... He's trying to get Zoran to come to him. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=728.1s)]
*  If you're a hot piece of ass, you don't just give it up for anybody for the first, you know... [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=731.1s)]
*  Like Tom Dick or Sally that comes through the door. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=736.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=738.1s)]
*  I'm trying to think what would be funniest places to bring you in New York. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=743.1s)]
*  I do think if you did a Prospect Park IRL stream, that would be really funny. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=749.1s)]
*  What is running into the Kaisen ad? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=753.1s)]
*  Yes, because that's exactly what would happen. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=755.1s)]
*  Except with like people who like... [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=757.1s)]
*  People with buns on their backpacks. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=759.1s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. And like who have like back problems. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=761.1s)]
*  People with buns on their backpacks who are DSA or whatever. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=765.1s)]
*  DSA, three year DSA guys with like a marketing job. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=772.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, it would be quite the scene. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=780.1s)]
*  And a lot of dogs. A lot of dogs. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=783.1s)]
*  Prospect Park is fun though. It's a special place. A very special place. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=790.1s)]
*  Have you been to the UN? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=796.1s)]
*  No, I have not. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=798.1s)]
*  I feel like you should get somebody to invite you to the UN. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=800.1s)]
*  Yo, UN chatters. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=804.1s)]

*  What's that? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=814.1s)]
*  King of Falafel in Astoria. King of Falafel in Shawarma. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=817.1s)]
*  Oh, this guy. Wait, I love this guy. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=822.1s)]
*  This is the guy who like has the Israeli flag that you have to step on to get into a store. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=826.1s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, that's cool. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=832.1s)]

*  I liked it. It was fine going down. I can't speak for the trajectory. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=899.1s)]
*  And how it will come out. But... [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=904.1s)]

*  Yeah, and it was so bad that... What was it? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=921.1s)]
*  He said that it was so like, lame that he was worried that it would make the campaign look bad. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=924.1s)]
*  He didn't want to be... [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=931.1s)]
*  He didn't want to be the guy who like... Yeah, I can see that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=933.1s)]
*  That's rough. Her team... [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=936.1s)]

*  You know, from the left or from the center left even, whatever. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=948.1s)]
*  And it wasn't embarrassing. It was just nice. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=952.1s)]
*  It was, you know, people smiled. There were so many smiles per minute. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=955.1s)]
*  Like... [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=960.1s)]
*  And instead of like, people trying... Like somebody who like, I don't know... [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=962.1s)]
*  I don't even have a good mental image anymore of like, who were the people that were running like creative, so to speak. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=968.1s)]
*  Or like that kind of media outreach on the Kamala campaign. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=976.1s)]
*  Because it was like, more than like anything as far as like, gauche. It was just forgettable. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=978.1s)]
*  Yeah, Zoran has ruined me for other political campaigns. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=984.1s)]
*  Now when... Standards, bars have been set, dude. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=991.1s)]
*  Yeah, now when someone comes up and they're like, oh, I want to, you know... [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=994.1s)]
*  Because other people see it and then they're like, oh, I want what you did with Zoran. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=999.1s)]
*  Like, can we do that too? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1003.1s)]
*  It's like, sure, you got a couple of like good policies that I might sign off on. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1005.1s)]
*  Like, are you ride or die? Are you with it the whole way? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1011.1s)]
*  You know? Now my expectations have risen. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1016.1s)]
*  As well they should. Because part of it also was that like, the thing is... [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1021.1s)]
*  I mean, this goes to like, you know, I mean like there's been a version of this debate playing out on Twitter and wherever for the last couple weeks. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1025.1s)]
*  But about how like, Yaron and his team are like very effective at communicating. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1031.1s)]
*  And how much of it is that, you know, like the ideas themselves are like what drive. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1037.1s)]
*  And obviously it's like in some measure both. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1043.1s)]
*  But to me it does like, it's like the thing that is inarguable is that the message is made so effective. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1047.1s)]
*  Because like, he's an honest ride or die guy. He's not like equivocating at all. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1054.1s)]
*  He just turns up the volume on some things and turns down the volume on others. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1059.1s)]
*  And that's not lying or misdirection. That's just politics, baby. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1063.1s)]
*  That's not what you're supposed to do when you're like trying to do it the right way. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1067.1s)]
*  Not like just trying to constantly play games of like cover your ass. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1071.1s)]
*  You know, for like hope that they don't notice your honest beliefs that you've advocated your whole life up until this moment. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1074.1s)]
*  Yeah. He also does have a very good way of just weaving in like liberal language in a way that is like impossible for liberals to just object to. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1081.1s)]
*  Even if it's like a leftist ideal. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1098.1s)]
*  Dude, I love his answer on Israel. His right to exist. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1101.1s)]
*  The equal rights thing is such a good like brain breaker. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1105.1s)]
*  It's like it's not it's not objectionable. You can't like say anything about it. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1109.1s)]
*  Otherwise, you present yourself as like someone who is against equal rights. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1113.1s)]
*  But that is fundamentally at odds with like the way that the Israeli state has been designed. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1118.1s)]
*  So it's a way of saying like Israel in its current formation has no right to exist without saying it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1122.1s)]
*  Yes, it's really sharp. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1128.1s)]
*  And it like also like kicks the ball back and puts the ball back in the other side of the court because it makes like the other person have to like answer like like like it. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1130.1s)]
*  It makes them address the premise, which is that like, yeah, Israel and equal. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1138.1s)]
*  It's apartheid. There's a tiered system of fucking existence there, not to mention the ongoing bloodshed that inequality. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1143.1s)]
*  But the people who live there, the people who run that state demand that that's what it has to be like. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1150.1s)]
*  And you make you know, it's just in one sentence. You get that answer. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1155.1s)]
*  I was I was very impressed. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1158.1s)]
*  I also think that there's now like. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1161.1s)]
*  Part of what it demonstrates right is that it's not that you have to be as like talented or smooth as Zoran, although he is both. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1166.1s)]
*  But it's also that like you don't have to apologize. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1171.1s)]
*  You don't have to apologize. You don't have to like say like, oh, I'm sorry that I didn't immediately want to like turn people in Gaza into paste after October 7th. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1174.1s)]
*  You don't have to like pretend something like that. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1182.1s)]
*  Like it's an 80 20 issue for us. Fucking lean into it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1184.1s)]
*  He has redefined that. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1197.1s)]
*  I mean, not redefined it, but like he's shown that look at us. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1200.1s)]
*  I don't know if it's too blown out. Left his best. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1204.1s)]
*  I mean, it makes me happy is this like. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1209.1s)]
*  It is one of the I mean, he was able to put these ideas to test and actually win an election like this. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1214.1s)]
*  This is literally like a [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1225.1s)]
*  Like this is literally at least a primary. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1237.36s)]
*  This is literally what I've been saying to every media outlet. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1240.36s)]
*  That's like approach me since the election being like, how do we what was the autopsy here? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1242.36s)]
*  Like, how do we lose? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1248.36s)]
*  How do we reach out to young men? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1250.36s)]
*  How do we have like, you know, how do we bridge the messaging gap? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1251.36s)]
*  And it's like, it's not the messaging, it's the message. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1254.36s)]
*  It's the policies and the people and the people that also is like it's lost. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1257.36s)]
*  No, but that's what but that's where I think Zoran being as charismatic as he is. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1262.36s)]
*  If he didn't have those policies, if he didn't have the backing, if he didn't have like the DSA and Working Families Party door knocking operations as well, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1268.36s)]
*  which he wouldn't be able to get without having this ideological background, he would not be. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1278.36s)]
*  That's not what I mean. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1284.36s)]
*  I 100% agree. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1285.36s)]
*  When I say people, though, what I don't mean is like the specific person of Zoran. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1287.36s)]
*  I mean that like it cannot be somebody who comes from the old way of doing things. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1292.36s)]
*  It can't be somebody with the last name Clinton. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1297.36s)]
*  It can't be somebody whose last job was in an Obama White House in politics. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1299.36s)]
*  It can't be somebody who used to work for the CIA. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1303.36s)]
*  It can now cannot be Alyssa Slotkin. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1306.36s)]
*  You know, like it's there's, you know, that's like I like you're connected to something that might seem a bit distant, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1309.36s)]
*  but I think is sort of related is like the abundance stuff. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1317.36s)]
*  Like part of what makes it what a lot of I find like the abundance argument to be about is that it's about like who is in the tent and who is not. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1320.36s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, if like Jake Oshensloss and Marie Glusson Camp Perez are like your legislative portraits for the people who represent that tendency, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1329.36s)]
*  then like, you know, it says something about that just in the way that like if Zoran is the avatar for the DSA, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1338.36s)]
*  it says something about like that kind of perspective. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1344.36s)]
*  And that to me is like, you know, what it means when I think when I when I have like a sense of optimism, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1347.36s)]
*  but like something I'm interested to see in the next year is like the extent to which people who more resemble that kind of like Zoran viability of a candidate, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1353.36s)]
*  whether they can emerge, you know, whether not just in the New York context, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1362.36s)]
*  not just at the perfect storm of the most hateable opponent ever with the opportunity to build a coalition against him and that kind of thing. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1365.36s)]
*  You know, like can we can be replicated? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1372.36s)]
*  Yeah, I I think that there are wow, there are Zoran's waiting to be awakened all around the country. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1375.36s)]
*  Sleeping Zoran's. Yeah. Sleeping Zoran. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1385.36s)]
*  Like adjusted to whichever neighborhood that they come from. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1389.36s)]
*  I think something that's been really underreported is kind of what you're saying with DSA, where he attracted vast support from DSA. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1394.36s)]
*  But as a consequence of that, he was also able to form a phenomenal team. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1402.36s)]
*  Like every single person I've met on Zoran's team has been like glazing himself the most. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1408.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1413.36s)]
*  You know, in the three videos I worked on. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1415.36s)]
*  No, it was like no. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1418.36s)]
*  Soul, Eric. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1421.36s)]
*  Every single person on the team is so good at what they do. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1423.36s)]
*  And I think it's because they believe in in what Zoran says. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1426.36s)]
*  And I think like you can't you can't replicate that same passion. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1429.36s)]
*  And I think the perfect example. No. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1434.36s)]
*  And like Cuomo is like the perfect example of that. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1436.36s)]
*  Like on election day, paid canvassers for Cuomo were telling Zoran volunteers that like, hey, yeah, I'm going to vote for Zoran later today. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1439.36s)]
*  But, you know, he's paying my ass to sit at this bus stop. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1448.36s)]
*  $250 a day. Not bad. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1451.36s)]
*  And there's the like added thing now of like, I just think that like we live in such a mediatized culture that the fact that like, you know, like it's one of the reasons why like the Bernie campaign was kind of important. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1453.36s)]
*  I still believe is like a vessel for introducing millions of Americans for the first time in their lives to the idea that there was just a different way to think about how the world could be ordered. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1467.36s)]
*  That like it didn't always have to be about making money and that kind of shit. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1477.36s)]
*  And in the same way, like now Zoran is, you know, like what is like the iterative like difference with like this wave of it? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1480.36s)]
*  And it's like, well, it's that you can say fuck you to people in power, not literally, but like you can represent like an alternative, a meaningful alternative tendency. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1487.36s)]
*  To power and achieve something you can win that you can do the thing Bernie didn't do. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1496.36s)]
*  You can win. And then a lot of it, you know, is again, like there's there were a lot of like specific advantages that I think people didn't necessarily understand as advantages going into the election. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1501.36s)]
*  Mainly the fact that Cuomo and Cuomo was was the was the primary opponent and being so weak. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1512.36s)]
*  But God Almighty, man, it's it's such a like just the idea now that like somebody anywhere else in the country could just think like, you know, that person in power, like it doesn't or like or this thing in power, like the system, the status quo, like it just doesn't have to be that way. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1520.36s)]
*  You know, and like, I don't know how many it's just so difficult to provide people with like proof of concept for that, you know, specific thing anymore. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1537.36s)]
*  You know, like that's that feels like the breakthrough. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1545.36s)]
*  Rain is going away. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1553.36s)]
*  Yeah, just a summer storm. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1555.36s)]
*  We have them all the time. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1558.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1559.36s)]
*  Sir, is it possible to turn the AC off a little bit? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1560.36s)]
*  Yeah, just make it a little bit colder. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1563.36s)]
*  We're almost there, too. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1567.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1569.36s)]
*  I was getting a little hot. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1571.36s)]
*  So by do you? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1573.36s)]
*  Yeah, dude, be coursing through my veins. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1574.36s)]
*  Warm you up. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1577.36s)]
*  It's giving you powers. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1578.36s)]
*  I'm getting. Yeah. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1579.36s)]
*  You're Chinese. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1580.36s)]
*  If only a little Chinese for him, Hassan. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1583.36s)]
*  My attitude about New York being beautiful shifted with the rain. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1593.36s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1596.36s)]
*  That's crap. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1597.36s)]

*  It's the rain that partly, you know, look at all this nourishing vegetation, the really scraggly trees that stick up out of the urban landscape. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1599.36s)]
*  All I can think of is like the wet trash bags that are on the streets. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1605.36s)]

*  Yeah, I saw I saw that they were. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1614.36s)]
*  Yeah, Eric Adams brought trash cans to New York. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1616.36s)]
*  That's what he did alone. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1618.36s)]
*  Nobody helped him. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1621.36s)]
*  A phenomenal achievement. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1622.36s)]
*  Many people are saying. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1625.36s)]
*  No one's ever no one's ever thought about this before. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1629.36s)]

*  You're from that part of Jersey here in New York. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1645.36s)]
*  We just put the trash on the streets for fun. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1647.36s)]
*  Yeah, we don't need a strike. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1649.36s)]
*  Yeah, they have they have trash bags, trash cans, but they still throw the trash. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1651.36s)]
*  Did you see, by the way, that lady who took that selfie like do it? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1655.36s)]
*  I think just like bragging about like breaking the strike. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1659.36s)]
*  Twenty five dollars a load. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1662.36s)]
*  Hit me up. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1664.36s)]
*  So stupid. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1667.36s)]
*  See, what I would have done was bought a really large thing, a large like extra [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1671.36s)]
*  trash cans solid, juristically so that it wouldn't smell and I wouldn't have to [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1677.36s)]
*  break the strike. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1682.36s)]
*  But I'm just a genius. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1683.36s)]
*  What do I know? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1685.36s)]
*  Yeah, not everyone's woke like you woke and smart woke and handsome and six four. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1687.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1695.36s)]
*  Also, twenty five dollars is not worth it for like even when you when you not even from [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1696.36s)]
*  like a class solidarity framework, but like that's just bad. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1708.36s)]
*  Oh, no, that's Philly. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1712.36s)]
*  That's like you got to understand, man. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1713.36s)]
*  Like so Pennsylvania is at the federal minimum wage. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1715.36s)]
*  Like salaries there. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1717.36s)]
*  Twenty five dollars. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1718.36s)]
*  I am putting trash in your car is crazy. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1719.36s)]

*  I that I appreciate it. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1723.36s)]
*  It wasn't a truck. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1725.36s)]
*  It wasn't a truck. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1726.36s)]
*  It was like a mini van. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1727.36s)]
*  But it's like you're you're literally permanently destroying a car. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1728.36s)]
*  A vehicle. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1731.36s)]
*  I don't think you're permanent. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1732.36s)]
*  There's no way the smell comes out of that. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1733.36s)]
*  I probably wasn't smelling awesome in the first place, but there's twenty five dollars [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1736.36s)]
*  a load. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1740.36s)]
*  Assuming that's like an hour of work. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1741.36s)]
*  That's three times. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1743.36s)]
*  That's three times the state minimum wage there already. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1744.36s)]
*  Like like that's like the math on that. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1747.36s)]
*  To quote Michael Clayton, the math on this is simple. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1752.36s)]
*  Like make the car stink. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1755.36s)]
*  PA wages are garbage. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1758.36s)]
*  That's why they come to New Jersey. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1759.36s)]

*  All right. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1789.36s)]
*  So give us a little back story, Noah, about why this hotel is relevant. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1790.36s)]
*  What happened here that we're going to. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1798.36s)]
*  So the Hotel Teresa in 1960, when Fidel Castro came to the UN and spoke, he was originally [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1800.36s)]
*  put up in a hotel like near the UN. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1806.36s)]
*  But it didn't work out him staying there. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1810.36s)]
*  And his staff was looking for an alternative. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1814.36s)]
*  And so they said, you know, what if we instead decided to, what if we instead decided to [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1816.36s)]
*  put everybody up in a hotel in Harlem, in the hotel that was like the symbol of like [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1828.36s)]
*  Harlem glitterati. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1833.36s)]
*  And that was the Hotel Teresa. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1836.36s)]
*  And so while the fat cats and the American capitalists and so on all dined in the Waldorf [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1838.36s)]
*  or stayed at the Waldorf Astoria or the Pierre far closer to the UN, Fidel stayed at the [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1845.36s)]
*  Hotel Teresa and he had, you know, legendary visitors. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1852.36s)]
*  Malcolm X came and spoke with him there and they had a really productive and great encounter. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1856.36s)]
*  We're going the right way. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1861.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1864.36s)]
*  One sec. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1865.36s)]
*  I don't think we're going the right way. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1866.36s)]
*  No, I don't either. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1869.36s)]
*  Yeah, no, no. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1870.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, there it is. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1871.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1872.36s)]
*  That's it. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1873.36s)]
*  So it's a special place. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1874.36s)]
*  It's important piece of history. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1896.52s)]
*  It's an important piece of Cuban and American history together. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1899.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like one of the few really nice moments we have to say about it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1902.2s)]
*  I mean, cruise ship is like the we covered in the second season of blowback, my podcast [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1905.2s)]
*  episode four, I think. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1912.2s)]
*  But there's another there's a book, a recent one you can read about it that gets part of [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1915.2s)]
*  the story pretty good. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=1920.2s)]

*  So it turned into offices. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2049.84s)]
*  It's no longer a hotel. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2050.84s)]
*  There's nothing commemorating Fido Castro coming here and staying here. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2053.84s)]
*  You don't think that an office building would want to do that? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2057.96s)]
*  I'm just surprised. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2061.0s)]
*  I still thought it was a hotel. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2062.0s)]
*  I thought it was like a still functioning hotel. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2063.0s)]
*  Isn't there a lobby somewhere? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2068.0s)]
*  I think we're looking at it. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2069.0s)]
*  This is it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2070.0s)]
*  This is literally the lobby. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2071.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2072.0s)]

*  He met with Malcolm X here, too, right? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2078.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2081.6s)]
*  Well, when Malcolm X came, there was a photo of it that's really important. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2082.6s)]
*  And Malcolm X describes the conversation as having been an important momentous for him. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2087.4s)]
*  I mean, he died only four years later. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2093.6s)]
*  The other thing, when they came to the Hotel Teresa, there was a black soldier in the [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2099.6s)]
*  Cuban delegation, Juan Almeida. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2106.88s)]
*  And Almeida was cheered after specifically because, you know, remember the time. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2109.48s)]
*  This is 1960, five years after the Bondo and Conference and so on. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2114.6800000000003s)]
*  The idea of an international third world solidarity that was cross-racial and so on. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2120.08s)]
*  Yes, this was a particular moment of a black identification with the Cuban struggle. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2125.6800000000003s)]
*  The context is that it was this... [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2133.68s)]
*  Oh, there. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2136.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's the picture. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2137.48s)]
*  That's the one everyone should know. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2138.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2140.48s)]
*  But it was this sense of Harlem, which was, again, the cultural capital of black America. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2141.48s)]

*  I've not seen the Lenin statue. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2273.48s)]
*  I know the famous one in Seattle, I think. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2275.48s)]
*  I was about to say the Seattle one I know because there is that guy who wrote that article. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2278.48s)]
*  They bought it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2284.48s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that the Lenin statue is in the West Side of Manhattan, New York City. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2285.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2288.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2289.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2290.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2291.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2292.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2293.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2294.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2295.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2296.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2297.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2298.48s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that was like it was supposed to be taken down or something and then like [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2299.88s)]
*  a guy bought it and put it on private property so it was never it couldn't be fucked with. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2303.48s)]
*  Oh well. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2309.08s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2310.08s)]
*  No. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2311.08s)]
*  So here's the theater. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2312.08s)]
*  I mean once upon a time. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2313.08s)]
*  Happening harder in Harlem. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2316.08s)]
*  The Apollo Stations of Victoria. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2320.08s)]
*  And there's a Renaissance New York Harlem Hotel? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2325.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2327.08s)]
*  Wait so what's the significance of the Apollo? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2328.68s)]
*  It's like a famous theater, like a mainstay of Harlem. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2331.68s)]
*  I'm sure they got another sign outside of it somewhere. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2336.68s)]
*  I mean if they don't then I don't think so. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2339.68s)]
*  They do not. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2342.68s)]
*  I don't think they have a cultural heritage of Victoria. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2343.68s)]
*  And then there's the Apollo. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2345.68s)]
*  Wait why are there two? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2351.68s)]
*  Well I think that one is Victoria. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2352.68s)]
*  I think they just, they're stealing the shine. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2354.68s)]
*  So to speak. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2358.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's the real Apollo. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2359.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2361.2799999999997s)]
*  But that one is the fake Apollo that looks like it's the real Apollo. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2362.2799999999997s)]
*  Well. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2365.2799999999997s)]
*  Are you sure that's not the real one? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2366.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that one says Victoria. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2368.2799999999997s)]
*  Right there. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2370.2799999999997s)]
*  This is Renaissance New York Harlem Hotel. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2372.2799999999997s)]
*  Look at the, look at the lights. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2374.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh it does say Victoria on the other side. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2376.2799999999997s)]
*  You're right. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2377.2799999999997s)]
*  No they're just renovating it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2378.2799999999997s)]
*  Because it's still a theater. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2380.2799999999997s)]
*  Where at least like they, it's supposed to be a new thing. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2382.2799999999997s)]
*  People would boo you on stage if you sucked. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2386.28s)]
*  You get ritualistically humiliated. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2395.28s)]
*  Where's the chopped cheese thing? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2400.28s)]
*  Apollo is the place where, I mean we're not going in the right direction. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2402.28s)]
*  I was just walking down to see Apollo. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2405.28s)]
*  I think it's 30 minutes that way. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2407.28s)]
*  That way? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2409.28s)]
*  That way? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2410.28s)]
*  I think it's that way. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2411.28s)]
*  I might be wrong. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2412.28s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2413.28s)]
*  Oh yeah it is that way. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2417.28s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2419.28s)]
*  But we caught it. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2420.28s)]
*  No I don't know. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2424.28s)]
*  We're going to walk past this Chick-fil-A for the 11th time. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2425.28s)]
*  It's more than 40 minutes. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2428.28s)]
*  We're just casing it. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2429.28s)]
*  40? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2430.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2431.28s)]
*  Do you want to get a car? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2432.28s)]
*  I mean we could, it's 11 minutes by car. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2433.28s)]
*  I do need the key. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2435.28s)]
*  It's no longer Pride Month so you can use the Chick-fil-A bathroom. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2438.28s)]
*  Yeah the, the Vigil is running through my body. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2442.28s)]
*  Let's just keep walking for a little bit. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2447.28s)]
*  I don't mind you doing that. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2450.28s)]
*  It's nice out finally. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2451.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2452.28s)]
*  It is nice out. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2453.28s)]
*  I need to go this way or go that way. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2455.28s)]
*  No let's cross. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2459.28s)]
*  At least we'll see the other side of the... [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2462.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2464.28s)]
*  Catch the other side of the street. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2465.28s)]
*  See what that has to offer. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2467.28s)]
*  There are so many, so many door dashers everywhere. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2476.28s)]
*  Yeah, New York is like door-dashers city dude. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2491.28s)]
*  Most of the people I know who haven't like been to New York in a minute, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2494.28s)]
*  like the first thing that like a lot of them observe [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2498.28s)]
*  is how many people on like e-bikes and stuff there are. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2501.28s)]
*  I mean e-bikes are chill. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2506.28s)]
*  No, but like it's not like a, like a thing of like, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2507.28s)]
*  God there are too many e-bikes. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2512.28s)]
*  It's just that like that is not what the streets used to look like. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2514.28s)]
*  I prefer e-bikes to fucking scooters. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2517.28s)]
*  I hate those things. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2520.28s)]
*  The lime scooters. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2522.28s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2523.28s)]
*  Well I hate that they just get dumped on the fucking sidewalk. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2524.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2527.28s)]
*  It's, it doesn't look good and it also... [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2530.28s)]
*  We'll just like straight up leave them on the, on the road. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2532.28s)]
*  Leave them on like crowded walkways. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2534.28s)]
*  It's annoying. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2539.28s)]
*  I'll see you later bro. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2543.28s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2547.28s)]
*  Wait, we need to, we need to go that way, up that way. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2555.28s)]
*  Let's cross and then we'll go up that way. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2558.28s)]
*  Where we, when you say up that way, what do you mean? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2560.28s)]
*  It says... [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2562.28s)]
*  Okay yeah, I see what you mean. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2564.28s)]
*  Let's just cross here. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2576.28s)]
*  Now the city e-bikes are really fun. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2584.28s)]
*  They cost too much to use, but they're fun. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2587.28s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2589.28s)]
*  Do they have, do they have like a bike share in LA at all? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2590.28s)]
*  Who did that guy say? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2593.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2594.28s)]
*  I didn't hear anything. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2596.28s)]
*  I'm sure she had somebody in check about it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2598.28s)]
*  I think he said now introducing walks in Harlem? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2600.28s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2603.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2606.28s)]
*  Stay safe, Harlem gets wild at night. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2612.28s)]
*  Okay bro. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2615.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, sure. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2616.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2618.28s)]
*  It's not like 1975 anymore. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2620.28s)]
*  Across 110th street though, great movie. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2625.28s)]
*  That chatter is like 78 years old. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2631.28s)]
*  Watch out. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2634.28s)]
*  I've heard that the Looney Tunes gang will run up on you. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2636.28s)]
*  Watch out, it's a historical black neighborhood. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2640.28s)]
*  Isn't Harlem also pretty much priced out at this point as well for most people? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2643.28s)]
*  No, I mean like everything in New York is, I wouldn't, I wouldn't really be in a position to call anything in New York relatively affordable, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2647.28s)]
*  but like Harlem remains like substantially black, even though it's obviously going through like pretty much every neighborhood, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2654.28s)]
*  like some measure of like gentrification and just, and you know, dislocation of people, like families who lived here for a while. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2661.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2671.28s)]
*  I live, I live downtown though, so I'll confess that like, I don't know. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2672.28s)]
*  I don't have like a particularly good sense of how quickly, block by block, how it's working up here, anything like that. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2675.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2682.28s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2684.28s)]
*  Harlem sounds so big. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2685.28s)]
*  Like, you know, we're in the 120s now, it goes another 20 blocks up, feels like it goes another 20 blocks down. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2686.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2695.28s)]
*  Incredibly priced out. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2696.28s)]
*  Two bedroom is 2400. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2704.28s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds right. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2706.28s)]
*  Two bedroom 2400 is like affordable in comparison to the rest of the city though. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2707.28s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2711.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2712.28s)]
*  Well, that's where it's like now, it's like, it's not, it's like obviously ceasing to be like a neighborhood that's like viable for like working class people. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2713.28s)]
*  And also like that two bedroom unit that's doing 2400 bucks a month, like probably has issues. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2721.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2727.28s)]
*  Someone said, bro, that's a one bedroom price. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2735.28s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds right. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2738.28s)]
*  I was thinking two for 24. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2739.28s)]
*  That sounds like 2017 prices to me. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2741.28s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2743.28s)]
*  Two for 24 is not gettable in Los Angeles in any neighborhood, I don't think. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2744.28s)]
*  No. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2748.28s)]
*  I don't think there's a single part of. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2750.28s)]
*  I don't think there's a single part of. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2752.28s)]
*  Are you guys streaming? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2753.28s)]
*  Yeah, we're streaming. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2755.28s)]
*  Yay! [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2757.28s)]
*  Oh, that's fine. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2758.28s)]
*  What's the content? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2759.28s)]
*  What's the content? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2760.28s)]
*  What the fuck are we following? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2762.28s)]
*  Hasan Abiy. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2763.28s)]
*  That's IG? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2764.28s)]
*  That's IG? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2765.28s)]
*  No, Twitch. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2766.28s)]
*  Twitch, Twitch only, okay? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2768.28s)]
*  I'm gonna tell the real fuck, y'all, you broke my gang. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2780.28s)]
*  What's the furthest you've walked in like LA? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2809.28s)]
*  Like at a given like, like, like nothing. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2814.28s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2817.28s)]
*  Two blocks. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2818.28s)]
*  I don't, I don't walk in LA. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2819.28s)]
*  There's nowhere to walk. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2823.28s)]
*  We don't even have this sidewalk in New York is normal. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2824.28s)]
*  Like the sidewalk width is like a normal sidewalk width. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2830.28s)]
*  In LA, you don't have a sidewalk like this. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2834.28s)]
*  And it's funny because in comparison to like European cities, European capitals, like these [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2837.28s)]
*  sidewalks are kind of ass too. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2843.28s)]
*  They're in a state of dire disrepair. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2845.28s)]
*  But at least it exists as opposed to not having any sidewalks at all. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2848.28s)]
*  Like there's so many spots in LA where you're walking and then the sidewalk just ends. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2855.28s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2860.28s)]
*  You know, you're just now, now you're on the fucking road. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2861.28s)]
*  Now you're just walking on the road. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2865.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2869.28s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2870.28s)]
*  It doesn't help also that everything's like a gazillion miles apart. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2872.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2875.28s)]
*  So we're walking in the direction of Central Park. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2881.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2884.28s)]
*  Which also was historically a black neighborhood, right? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2885.28s)]
*  Before they. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2889.28s)]
*  Seneca Village is what it was called. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2890.28s)]
*  And it was raised for to make way for Mr. Olmstead's vision. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2892.28s)]
*  But there's like New York is also like, so for example, in like south of Chinatown, actually [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2897.28s)]
*  right now, like pretty much where one police plaza is and like west of it is like what [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2903.28s)]
*  used to be the five points, like from like gangs in New York. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2909.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2913.28s)]
*  Like essentially like a giant slum that like at the time of its existence in the 19th century [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2914.28s)]
*  was considered the like densest, like agglomeration of, you know, you know, the criminal and [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2920.28s)]
*  poor and black, you know, all living together, jammed side by side. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2929.28s)]
*  And you still see like five points mission, other stuff around there. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2935.28s)]
*  So there is like a fairly I mean, at this point, like these are like 200 year old things [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2938.28s)]
*  we're describing. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2946.28s)]
*  So it's like it's not like the memory suppressed because it's like so many generations removed. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2947.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2953.28s)]
*  But it is like the history that was like literally pavered over by like the successive generations [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2954.28s)]
*  of the development of New York. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2959.28s)]
*  Oh, that one doesn't even give a shit. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2961.28s)]
*  That was dope. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2964.28s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2966.28s)]
*  Did you think you thought we played here? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2968.28s)]
*  You thought we played here? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=2970.28s)]

*  Yeah, dude. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3036.28s)]
*  Goddamn. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3037.28s)]
*  There's a really good famous shot. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3038.28s)]
*  I forget if it's Yankee or Shea Stadium in the background, but in the foreground, it's [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3041.28s)]
*  just a bunch of dirt roads, and it kind of looks like a third world country or something. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3046.28s)]
*  It's pretty strange. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3052.28s)]
*  I mean, it feels strange because you've got these totems of modernity, the fucking Yankee [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3054.28s)]
*  or Shea Stadium, whatever it is. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3059.28s)]
*  Kind of like that photograph of the Capitol building in DC in the background, and then [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3061.28s)]
*  the foreground are some incredibly poor black people. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3066.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3070.28s)]
*  Although now here, everything is just expensive, so it's not exactly a fair comparison. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3074.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3078.28s)]

*  I mean, I've walked in all the European capitals for the most part. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3100.28s)]
*  Tokyo. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3105.28s)]

*  Istanbul. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3108.28s)]
*  Got to go to China. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3109.28s)]
*  Hopefully China in September. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3110.28s)]
*  What's been the best one to walk in? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3113.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3116.28s)]
*  Barcelona. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3119.28s)]
*  They're all really nice. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3120.28s)]
*  They're all very pleasant to look at. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3121.28s)]
*  France. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3124.28s)]
*  All the cities are really... [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3125.28s)]
*  Especially with historic architecture, it makes it much nicer. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3129.28s)]
*  Croatia was a bitch because of all the castles. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3133.28s)]
*  Because half the cities are built inside of historic castles. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3138.28s)]
*  Can we take a picture? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3143.28s)]

*  Yeah, the cobblestone. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3155.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3157.28s)]
*  It's cool as fuck though to see things that people made hundreds of years ago. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3159.28s)]
*  If not longer than that. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3168.28s)]
*  I don't think Americans have the capacity to understand being in a structure that has survived hundreds of years. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3172.28s)]
*  This is a son. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3183.28s)]
*  I am Israeli. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3184.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3185.28s)]
*  I am understanding this all the time. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3186.28s)]
*  Yeah, 3000 years. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3189.28s)]
*  We have been here uninterrupted. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3192.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3195.28s)]

*  I saw you stream. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3216.28s)]
*  I saw you in the city and then me and my mom drove over here. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3217.28s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3227.28s)]
*  Do you mind if we take a picture with you? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3228.28s)]
*  Of course. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3229.28s)]
*  Alright, hold on. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3230.28s)]
*  Hopefully my phone doesn't die. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3231.28s)]
*  You don't look... [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3233.28s)]

*  Okay, wait. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3241.28s)]
*  Let me get on this side. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3242.28s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3243.28s)]
*  It's all good. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3244.28s)]
*  There you go. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3246.28s)]
*  What else is there to see around here? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3247.28s)]
*  Well, Harlem is like pretty residential so it's kind of hard to do like fun stuff. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3251.28s)]
*  Most of the cool stuff is downtown. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3256.28s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta... [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3258.28s)]
*  Yeah, she has to go get the car. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3259.28s)]
*  But like you went to the Apollo's, that's pretty much like the historical stuff. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3261.28s)]
*  Like you were saying Seneca Village is like Central Park which isn't really there anymore. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3264.28s)]
*  Yeah, but I go to college in PA so I don't really know like the fun spots here no more. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3272.28s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3277.28s)]
*  It's all good. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3278.28s)]
*  But we're just marching. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3279.28s)]
*  We don't want to get chopped cheese. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3280.28s)]
*  Oh, for real? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3282.28s)]
*  Like you went to the original chopped cheese spot? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3283.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3285.28s)]
*  Nah, it's fire. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3286.28s)]
*  Get on a hero, don't get it on a... [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3287.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3289.28s)]
*  Get on a bigger one. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3290.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3291.28s)]
*  Nah, it's fine. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3292.28s)]
*  I can put it down. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3293.28s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3294.28s)]
*  Anyway, I don't want you up. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3295.28s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3296.28s)]
*  Nice to meet you, man. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3297.28s)]

*  Yeah, have a good walk. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3299.28s)]
*  Take care, man. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3300.28s)]
*  Listen, I ain't no Zoran but this is the moment that's coming up. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3301.28s)]
*  Oh, you saw that Zoran video? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3305.28s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3307.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3308.28s)]
*  Listen, when we were walking in Astoria, it was like that. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3309.28s)]
*  It was like that. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3312.28s)]
*  People were coming up to him. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3313.28s)]
*  Even back then. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3315.28s)]
*  I could see it. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3316.28s)]
*  I could see it. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3317.28s)]
*  Because it was like... [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3318.28s)]
*  I mean, granted, I know that like that has been how it is. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3319.28s)]
*  It's been like that for like a minute and then it just went into overdrive. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3323.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3327.28s)]
*  Now, Astoria is different though because that was all like... [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3328.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's the fucking commie corridor as they call it. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3330.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3333.28s)]
*  No, I was really... [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3334.28s)]
*  You know, there's a couple of videos that like, you know, can get you a little emotional. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3338.28s)]
*  And that one definitely got me. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3343.28s)]
*  Oh, people coming out? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3344.28s)]
*  Like, do you remember like the one... [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3345.28s)]
*  You know, it's like you don't want it to be about like the person. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3347.28s)]
*  It's just like the sense of like that there's like a guy that people feel this like warmly toward [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3349.28s)]
*  and seeing that like the warmth and the love that they have. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3354.28s)]
*  Like that... [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3356.28s)]
*  Do you remember that video of Bernie's on the sidewalk and the UPS guy? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3357.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3361.28s)]
*  And he's like calling and he like goes like they tap someone on the shoulders. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3362.28s)]
*  It's like, oh! [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3365.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3367.28s)]
*  Like kill me now. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3368.28s)]
*  It's such a fucking mark. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3369.28s)]
*  I'm a rube. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3370.28s)]
*  All they would have to do is like orchestrate shit like that all the time and I'd be bought. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3371.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3375.28s)]
*  And then he just takes all that goodwill and starts talking about Netanyahu's war. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3376.28s)]
*  Netanyahu's war. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3381.28s)]
*  Netanyahu's war. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3383.28s)]
*  Not anybody else's. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3384.28s)]
*  Lord knows nobody worse could possibly take his place should something happen, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3385.28s)]
*  should something befall Netanyahu. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3391.28s)]
*  Shame. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3396.28s)]
*  Shame. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3397.28s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3398.28s)]
*  He's so old. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3399.28s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3400.28s)]
*  It's like it's like Norm with like non-Palestine related takes sometimes. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3401.28s)]
*  I'm like, I don't care. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3405.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3407.28s)]
*  I mean, I think it's just sort of like it's a missed opportunity is how I think about it. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3408.28s)]
*  The missed opportunity being that like there's this like like pretty big void of like leadership [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3413.28s)]
*  that like a Jewish American unfortunately has to occupy for like discursive purposes, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3419.28s)]
*  which is like to have to be able to say and communicate to people, it's okay to say that [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3424.28s)]
*  Israel sucks. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3428.28s)]
*  Not to say Netanyahu sucks. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3429.28s)]
*  Not to say that like the people currently in charge of the Israeli government and military. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3431.28s)]
*  I think he does that by just like not saying it himself, but just like stepping out of [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3436.28s)]
*  the way when other people say it. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3440.28s)]
*  He doesn't correct. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3442.28s)]
*  He doesn't scold. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3443.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3444.28s)]
*  He doesn't like spend any time. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3445.28s)]
*  Here, one sec. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3446.28s)]
*  He doesn't spend any time on like like people that outflank him on that stuff. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3447.28s)]
*  And he doesn't he doesn't shy away from like lending support to people like that, whether [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3452.28s)]

*  What? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3523.28s)]
*  Like one of the things that's like was so crazy with the whole Zoran campaign and was [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3526.28s)]
*  so meaningful was the like I mean, basically like the fact that like Lander like went out [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3534.28s)]
*  on that limb, you know, I mean, not really. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3541.28s)]

*  to do right now is not make it a problem to say words that are like Arabic words like [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3572.28s)]
*  just like just on a simple level. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3577.28s)]

*  Osama Be Laggin. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3818.28s)]
*  That's a good name. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3820.28s)]
*  That is such a good name. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3823.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3826.28s)]
*  Also, we're walking on 110th Street right now. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3827.28s)]
*  What is that? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3831.28s)]
*  What's the significance of this? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3832.28s)]
*  Well, there's just a really great movie and a great song made for the movie by Bobby Womack. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3833.28s)]
*  The movie, uh, the big star in it, whom I love anyways, Yaffe Kato. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3837.28s)]
*  So you should watch it. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3843.28s)]
*  It's a great film. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3844.28s)]
*  What's it about? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3845.28s)]
*  It's like a crime heist movie, but it's like, like a white, a racist white cop gets paired [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3846.28s)]
*  with like a black, a black, more junior detective played by Yaffe Kato. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3853.28s)]
*  He's like an alien and other stuff, uh, to investigate a robbery in which people are [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3859.28s)]
*  dressed like cops. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3866.28s)]
*  Oh. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3867.28s)]
*  And it like snowballs, um, and has like a very powerful climax, but also just has like [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3868.28s)]
*  an incredible score, a lot of action. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3874.28s)]
*  It's on Criterion Collection a lot. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3876.28s)]
*  Probably it's on YouTube or something at this point, seemingly everything is. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3879.28s)]
*  Is the focus off chat? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3882.28s)]
*  Oh, here you can tweak it off the lens. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3884.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3889.28s)]
*  Is that better? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3890.28s)]
*  That's a cool build. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3895.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3898.28s)]
*  There we go. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3906.28s)]
*  Looks fun to me. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3907.28s)]
*  Excellent vibes. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3909.28s)]
*  There are a lot of, uh, because of like Kyson at's impact, I would say, Kyson at AMP, there [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3912.28s)]
*  are a lot of young black and brown teenagers that want to become Twitch streamers now. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3926.28s)]
*  It's a good thing overall, but like most people, uh, under different circumstances, I feel [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3932.28s)]
*  like most people would look at this and be like, this is strange. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3939.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3941.28s)]
*  But now everybody knows exactly what's going on. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3942.28s)]
*  Yeah, that was true. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3944.28s)]
*  There were a few like people who like, they didn't, had no idea who you were, but like [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3945.28s)]
*  absolutely really conscious of like, Oh, bright light camera. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3951.28s)]
*  Somebody walk in holding. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3955.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3956.28s)]
*  I know what that is. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3957.28s)]
*  I don't think that's a good thing. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3958.28s)]
*  Well, why not? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3963.28s)]
*  Why? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3964.28s)]
*  It's just another way of making content. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3965.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, we can self-expression. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3967.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3971.28s)]
*  It's like, I only white people get to ruin the next generation. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3972.28s)]
*  It's also not like by itself, the right self. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3976.28s)]
*  Anything we were just talking about this earlier today, that it's like, there are a beacons [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3983.28s)]
*  of positivity in all of the, uh, endless shittiness. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3990.28s)]
*  Like Maya, my friend runs a conservation animal conservation place called Alvea Sanctuary [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=3994.28s)]
*  and the Texas flash floods destroyed their road into the, uh, into the sanctuary. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4001.28s)]
*  So there's no going in or going out because someone had, I think like, uh, damn the culvert [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4011.28s)]
*  that they had. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4017.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4018.28s)]
*  So the road flooded and it was already dirt. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4019.28s)]
*  So it just like got destroyed. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4021.28s)]
*  And then she was able to raise with all of the other Twitch streamers, she was able [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4023.28s)]
*  to raise like $180,000 to the sanctuary in two days. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4028.28s)]
*  A bunch of other Twitch streamers came and like personally helped rebuild the road. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4032.28s)]
*  They got it up in two days. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4038.28s)]
*  That was cool as hell. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4041.28s)]
*  So there is like a lot of weird stuff, a lot of drama, people being loud and obnoxious [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4043.28s)]
*  in public. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4049.28s)]
*  But then there's also the positives. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4050.28s)]
*  I mean, I think when it succeeds, it's like, it ends up being like a twofold thing of like [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4052.28s)]
*  one person gets to make something really exciting and interesting. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4060.28s)]
*  And then everybody else, like, because of how the structure of the internet works, like [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4064.28s)]
*  forms in community around that person. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4068.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4070.28s)]
*  Right, chat? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4071.28s)]
*  But then also, oh, it's $250,000. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4072.28s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4076.28s)]
*  But then also, for as many people like myself that are out there trying to do like, make [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4078.28s)]
*  a positive change, there are plenty of people who want to make a negative change. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4085.28s)]
*  And there are definitely communities that, like you said, orient themselves around the [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4089.28s)]
*  negative change as well. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4098.280000000001s)]
*  Sorry, can I take a picture of you? [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4100.280000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4103.280000000001s)]
*  You want to take a picture of me? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4104.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4105.280000000001s)]
*  Why? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4106.280000000001s)]
*  Because I'm going to take a picture of you. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4107.28s)]

*  Like why one suffers through a summer like this. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4168.48s)]

*  I'm hearing the whipping. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4929.16s)]
*  That's the chopping. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4935.16s)]
*  What is chopped cheese, Noah? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4939.16s)]

*  Yes. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4947.16s)]
*  You just don't know what it is. You just get it when you're drunk. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4949.16s)]
*  I just know it's like beef and cheese and onions I think. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4951.16s)]
*  Lettuce, tomatoes, onions. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4953.16s)]
*  Salt, pepper, ketchup, mayo. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4955.16s)]
*  I haven't had it. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4957.16s)]
*  I don't think I've had chopped cheese in nine years. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4959.16s)]
*  In nine years? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4961.16s)]
*  Well yeah. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4963.16s)]

*  I'm a big fan. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4971.16s)]
*  I don't need it. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4973.16s)]
*  Also it's very heavy. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4975.16s)]
*  Sometimes in the morning that's just not what you want. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4977.16s)]
*  It's a good drunk food. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4979.16s)]
*  Yeah exactly. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4981.16s)]
*  It's a hangover thing. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4983.16s)]
*  Now that climate change has turned New York summers into Texas summers. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4985.16s)]
*  Zoran's trying to get the whole city on solar. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4987.16s)]
*  I mean New York gets this hot. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4989.16s)]
*  It's not weird. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4991.16s)]
*  It's not. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4993.16s)]
*  I mean it's the frequency. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4995.16s)]
*  This isn't record breaking but it's not good that it happens so often. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4997.16s)]
*  And also I would like it to not. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=4999.16s)]

*  I would like it to not. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5015.16s)]
*  I would like it to be less oppressive. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5017.16s)]
*  That sounds nice. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5019.16s)]
*  Although that does seem like a pipe dream in our lifetimes. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5021.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5023.16s)]

*  We're going to have to get on the new Japanese tech. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5031.16s)]
*  Have you ever seen those? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5033.16s)]
*  In Japan they got shirts that have vents in them. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5035.16s)]
*  And it's just like a constant flow of air. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5037.16s)]

*  Maybe because we're in Harlem. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5909.16s)]
*  Or maybe it's because it's night time. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5911.16s)]
*  Or maybe it's because Anime Expo [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5913.16s)]
*  totally distorted my [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5915.16s)]
*  understanding of getting mobbed. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5917.16s)]

*  once we started eating. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWxJIMIjZQ&t=5947.16s)]
