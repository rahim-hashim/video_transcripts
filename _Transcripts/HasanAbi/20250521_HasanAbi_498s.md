# Kneecap Charged Over A FLAG | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo)
*  That is the allegation that the police have charged Liam Hannah with a member of the rap [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=0.0s)]
*  band, Nika a bit of breaking news to bring you now, because I can tell you that UK police have [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=7.2s)]
*  charged Liam Hannah, who is a member of England, doesn't have a first amendment. So this happens [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=14.16s)]
*  all the time. I know. Did they not do it in the U S sorry, if I'm dumb. No, they did this. I don't [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=19.84s)]
*  even know exactly where they did this. Yeah. Also one of the members of kneecap is charged with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=26.16s)]
*  offense. Liam Ohana was charged with displaying a flag and support of Hezbollah, a prescribed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=35.92s)]
*  prescribed organization. A metropolitan police said the 27 year old from Belfast is due to appear [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=41.76s)]
*  at Westminster magistrates court. The force added this is literally because they said is real by the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  way, like they, this is not because of the flag. First of all, waving the flag and getting, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=52.96s)]
*  getting arrested or getting criminally prosecuted for waving the Hezbollah flag is insane, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=59.84s)]
*  especially considering that the Hezbollah flag is a flag of an active political party that is a part [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=64.64s)]
*  of the Lebanese parliament, right? But of course, that's just how the UK goes. Okay. Can't do that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=70.72s)]
*  You, I know it's illegal. I know it's, it's completely insane. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=76.8s)]
*  We'll start off our conversation with the kneecap boys. Let's take a look now because I can tell you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=85.36s)]
*  charged Liam Ohana, who is a member of the band kneecap with a fence for displaying a flag in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=92.88s)]
*  support of Hezbollah. That is the allegation. That is the allegation that the police have [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=100.64s)]
*  charged Liam Ohana with a member of the rap band kneecap. A bit of breaking news to bring you now, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=108.08s)]
*  because I can tell you that UK police have charged Liam Ohana, who is a member of- [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=116.16s)]
*  England doesn't have a first amendment. So this happens all the time. I know. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=123.12s)]
*  No, did they not do it in the U S sorry if I'm dumb. No, they did this at, I don't even know [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=126.16s)]
*  exactly where they did this. By the way, if the rest of the band didn't apologize, they probably [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=131.92s)]
*  also be going to jail too. This is just the one person that had the flag that's going to, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=137.12s)]
*  that's maybe going to go to jail. Hopefully it's just a fine. But yes, this is England behavior, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=142.4s)]
*  England activities. You already know what it is. It's disgusting. Like think about it this way. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=149.04s)]
*  The EDL doesn't get this level of aggro attention and they've been able to basically become a part [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=154.56s)]
*  of the reform party and they're out and about fascist. Keir Starmer is on ironically. Keir [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=161.76s)]
*  Starmer is on ironically channeling sentiment. Okay. Hold on. Why is this up? Keir Starmer is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=168.96s)]
*  on ironically channeling sentiment when talking about immigrants. Meanwhile, you have this situation [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=176.96s)]
*  where popular Irish music group is criminally prosecuted for waving the Hezbollah flag. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=183.52s)]
*  I personally don't give a shit about people who wave the Hezbollah flag. Like, yeah, oh no, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  it's branded as a organization. This is completely not allowed. Okay. It would be a lot different if [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  they were actually waving a dangerous flag like a Nazi flag or the EDL flag. Except, you know, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  when you do that kind of stuff, you get to basically be a part of the British government. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=209.6s)]
*  You can do blood libel against Muslims all day every day, but God forbid, yeah, you can wave the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=215.68s)]
*  Israeli flag even though Israel's doing it. The EDL haven't become a part of the Reform UK. The [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  EDL haven't been active since the late 2010s. The EDL has not been active since the late 2010s [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=228.56s)]
*  because it's de facto what the reform party's positions are. And it's actually not only seeped [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=233.12s)]
*  into the reform party's positions, it quite literally is a part of, like, it's a part of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=239.2s)]
*  the Labour Party's positions at this point. Like, we've moved past the Tories. Whenever someone says [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  like, oh, EDL is inactive, yeah, I know. So is, what is it called, like, Pageta or whatever. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  There's no need for your outsider white nationalist group to exist if the same exact positions are [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=258.96s)]
*  being championed by an active party. And also, the same exact positions are now even being [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=266.96s)]
*  repeated by the opposition, the Labour Party that is supposed to be in charge right now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they went from EDL to UKIP, then vote leave and now reform. Anyone who doesn't understand that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  that's precisely what's going on here is being silly. Stammer literally did a speech that used [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=288.24s)]
*  the Islands of Strangers line that Enoch Powell did in his rivers of blood speech. He's trying to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=293.12s)]
*  outrace his reform as if this won't normalize them further and lead to their victory in 2029. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=298.08s)]
*  That's precisely what's going on. And it's something that I've mentioned. It's something [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  that I mentioned was going to inevitably happen and it's happening faster than I thought it was [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=307.52s)]
*  going to. Oh, God. England, UK, what the are you guys doing? On the one hand, they're like, well, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=312.08s)]
*  you know, Israel's mass starvation campaign seems unconscionable. Maybe we should stop that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=321.52s)]
*  On the other hand, they don't even like Israel is a far, far, far, far worst group by any metric [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  than Hezbollah is. Okay. It's not even a goddamn question. It's not even close. Okay. It's not even [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=336.88s)]
*  close. Same with Hamas. And yet you can obviously wave the IDF dog tag everywhere you go. You can [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=345.04s)]
*  wave the Israeli flag everywhere you go. There is not even an ounce of scrutiny towards that sort of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  thing. I hate this goddamn double standard. It's just one that only can exist if you don't consider [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  Muslims to be human. If you don't consider Arabs to be human, because Israel and all of the people [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=363.36s)]
*  that Israel's killing are technically collateral damage because, you know, they were in the way. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=369.12s)]
*  Israel foreign diplomats just today earlier today. Oh my God, stop touching your hair. No, I can't [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=376.08s)]
*  stop touching it up. And I don't know. I don't care. Whatever. Shut up. It's fine. Now I have a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=382.16s)]
*  hard time believing so much opinion can get us all this work footage, but no other country besides [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=388.48s)]
*  the one person learning it is in has interpretations present that I'm waiting for a daily exhibit with [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=392.16s)]
*  Donald Trump and there's no one stopping the war with my control. What are you saying? Okay. The [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=398.64s)]
*  BDS movement in Berlin has been decl- has been classified as an enemy of the constitution. This [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=403.12s)]
*  could increase repression. Nice. As Israel gets more violent, its Western allies get more repressive [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=407.12s)]
*  with their speech laws. But no, Hezbollah oppresses women and Hamas are homophobic. Double [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  standards at its finest. Yeah, that's the other side of this. It's like, yeah, those guys are. Okay. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  So what Israel is killing all of the women and all of the gay people. You know what I mean? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=426.32s)]
*  It doesn't matter. I hate this shit. I hate it so much. It's so frustrating. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. I genuinely so worried about reform getting elected next gen election labor [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  is straight up using the Democrats failed strategy. I know, but look, the inconsistencies [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=444.16s)]
*  are glaring and they're obvious. The inconsistencies of saying like, maybe what Israel is doing is kind [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=450.16s)]
*  of bad too on the one hand. Okay. While also on the other hand being like, well, you know, this is [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=458.08000000000004s)]
*  illegal. Like you will go to jail if you, if you wave the banner of the, the enemy. But of course, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  they do not have free speech. And for the record, this should be a warning sign for all of you here [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=473.36s)]
*  in the United States of America. They want to have this lack of free speech here as well. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=478.88s)]
*  Snappy apples five. Thank you for the holy moly. 25 get the subs. Where is the, the Macy's. Did you [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=484.32s)]
*  send a playlist? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyAzSPUtwBo&t=491.84s)]
