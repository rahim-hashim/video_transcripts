**HasanAbi:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg)
*  Because they're trying trying to keep track. They're trying to develop. Oh [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=0.0s)]

*  An oar to lon, you know what? I mean, I feel like I need to cover up because this is an affront to God [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, I am disrespecting God by deriving this much satisfaction [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  from [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  I [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=29.92s)]
*  After this I'm gonna dive into the Tucker Carlson regime change [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Donk says actually, you know what? Let's get into it [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=38.88s)]
*  Senator, thank you very much for spending it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Goddamn as loud as hell to have this conversation. It's good to be with you [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=44.96s)]
*  So you've come out for regime change in Iran as distinct just from taking up dates. What does regime change look like in Iran? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=48.56s)]
*  Somebody else in charge. How do you get there? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  Look that ultimately has to be a popular and it's not a complicated question is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  America better off [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=63.4s)]
*  With a country that has a leader who hates us and want to kill us [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=65.0s)]
*  One who's hilarious a yanda tell it a little otter do more at the bus who do you hear her? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=69.12s)]
*  I'll be da powerful is do you love a monocledom is sionist köpeyi? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=72.96s)]
*  Evet [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=76.56s)]
*  Do you? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=78.0s)]
*  Adamlar çocuk bile öldüremiyorlar israeli ve deniyorlar ama öldüremiyorlar yeterince [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=79.36s)]
*  Düşün ondan sonra diyor ki biz en büyük en güçlü ordumuz bizim [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=85.16s)]
*  Wants to kill us or to have a country with a leader who likes us and wants to be friends with us [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=89.68s)]
*  And definitely the latter is better, of course. Yeah, and so that's not a complicated [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=94.36s)]
*  Statement look I I believe you look across the world when you have countries that have dictators that are viciously anti-america [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  Venezuela Maduro hates us would we be better off with Maduro out of power? Absolutely [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  I want our enemies out of power and I want our friends in power that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  I could not agree more the question is how do you get there? Of course, we've been trying to kill Maduro for quite some time [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=115.68s)]
*  We have troops there. I don't know that we've been trying to kill Maduro. We have and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=121.16s)]
*  And I should know my dad was in the CIA and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=126.0s)]
*  Is responsible for voice of America? I'm Tucker Buckley Swanson McNear Carlson [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  That's his full name. Don't know that okay [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=137.0s)]
*  As a statement of fact we have so we do have massive sanctions we try to pressure him out of all [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=139.32s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=143.76s)]
*  I'm just saying there's a lot of pressure coming from various parts of the US government on that government and it's still there. Yeah same the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=145.2s)]
*  country very ancestors Cuba, you know [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=153.56s)]
*  1959 we've been working on that hasn't worked. So it's it's I really both agree it's hard [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=156.16s)]
*  To do it absolutely is hard and look I think you're reasonable to ask [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=160.38s)]
*  How do we produce that and and I think there's a distinction between what your objective is and the means to get it [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=164.2s)]
*  There are all sorts of things. I would say we would be better off [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=170.8s)]
*  We'd be better off in China without she there should we invade China and topple? She of course not better off with no national debt [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=173.44s)]
*  I you know, there are lots of things [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=179.54s)]
*  Yeah, we can't I wonder why oh perhaps it's because they have books and also they're a you know [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=182.8s)]
*  Superpower that matches our own perhaps a lesson should be learned for Iran there say all right [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=189.72s)]
*  What are our objectives right so with the ayatollah in Iran? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=195.16s)]
*  Saying you're for regime change. I don't view as complicated. I mean the the guy [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=198.12s)]
*  Literally leads mobs chanting death to America [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=203.4s)]
*  So that's not good [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=208.24s)]
*  Definitely not good. Um [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=210.64s)]
*  But the reason I think it's important to get a little more detailed about how that might happen [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=212.68s)]
*  Is because there's military action in progress which we're supporting and the president has said clearly including last night [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=217.56s)]
*  That he's focused on eliminating the capacity of the reigning government to produce weapons [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=223.28s)]
*  You are saying we need to use military force to affect regime change. I have not said that oh, I'm [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=228.0s)]
*  No, I've not said that once. I don't think we need to use military force to do regime change [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=234.28s)]
*  I said I support it. I would like to see it happen. You asked me how should it happen a popular uprising [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  What so what I've advocated for? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=244.42s)]
*  Let's step back a second [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=246.94s)]
*  You and I we've known each other a long time. I [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=248.98s)]
*  would say we agree on about 80% of the things on earth for sure and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  There are a lot of things and then we get into the nitty-gritty of foreign policy as much as you want [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=258.9s)]
*  There are a lot of things on which you and I agreed not just a little bit but violently. I totally agree [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=264.02s)]
*  Um, I was rooting for in your last campaign for well, thank you [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=269.7s)]
*  You have been heroic on on the border you have been one of the clearest and best voices in the in the whole country [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=272.94s)]
*  On securing the border and on the absolute crisis we're facing and in Texas. I see it and live it every day [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=279.94s)]
*  You know, it's funny about this. This is Ted Cruz buttering up Tucker [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=285.94s)]
*  To win over his audience, but this also ends up making Tucker Carlson's retaliations later down the line look way worse [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=290.94s)]
*  From Ted Cruz's position because I think he thought I [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=300.1s)]
*  Think he thought that this would this kind of buttering up would allow Tucker to not be as contentious not be as adversarial [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=304.26s)]
*  Tucker Carlson had the knives out [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=309.38s)]
*  In COVID [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=312.42s)]
*  In fact, you may recall in the middle of the COVID lockdown [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=314.42s)]
*  I was out walking my dog when the whole world was shut down and we were living in lunatic times [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=317.9s)]
*  And I called you and said Tucker your nightly monologues are the single best thing on television [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=322.3s)]
*  Like like things I watch them like like an injection of crack of can mix in my metaphor because you don't inject crack but but [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=327.54s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=334.54s)]
*  Glaze [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=336.54s)]
*  Standing up and speaking pop it pop it [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=338.54s)]
*  Pop his dick out of your mouth. Take it out [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=340.54s)]
*  Take it out with a pop [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=342.54s)]
*  What the hell are we doing in a way that we desperately desperately need it? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=344.54s)]
*  And so whether it's securing the border whether it's the insanity of COVID lockdowns [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=348.54s)]
*  Yeah, this is crazy [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=352.54s)]
*  Whether it's the insanity of COVID lockdowns [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=354.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, this is correct. This chatter is correct, by the way [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=356.70000000000005s)]
*  He's like we disagree on foreign intervention, but I think we can both agree white nationalism is great. It literally also [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=358.70000000000005s)]
*  COVID was phony. It was a hoax [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=366.54s)]
*  Right. Remember the good old days when we were in the mandates [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=368.70000000000005s)]
*  Whether it is the Second Amendment or the First Amendment you and I agree on a ton of stuff [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  The 20% we disagree I do think is meaningful and it's mostly in the foreign policy space [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=377.5s)]
*  And and what I would say [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=383.42s)]
*  If you'll allow me to get a little theoretical and then I'm happy to get specific, yeah [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=388.34s)]
*  For a long time people have perceived [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=394.18s)]
*  Two different poles of Republican foreign policy [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=397.1s)]
*  there have been interventionists and those have been people like John McCain and Lindsey Graham and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=400.74s)]
*  There have been isolationists and then the most prominent of those have been Ron Paul and Rand Paul and there are others and then people [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=406.94s)]
*  Perceived those are the two choices. You got to be one of the other [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=413.02s)]
*  I've always thought both were wrong. I don't agree with either one [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=415.94s)]
*  The way I view my own foreign I'm with you by the way for whatever it's worth. I agree with you [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=420.26s)]
*  Okay, good. I don't know who set up that binary, but there are lots of choices actually [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=425.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean people sort of naturally fall into I think they want to classify people and they're like, okay [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=428.74s)]
*  you're one of the other and you got to be all or nothing and and and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=433.97999999999996s)]
*  The interventionist it seems have never seen a country they didn't want to invade and that doesn't make any sense to me [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=437.78s)]
*  And the isolationist I think don't take the threats to America seriously [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=442.82s)]
*  And I think that's naive and it doesn't work and and so my view I consider myself a third point on the triangle and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=447.34s)]
*  And what I described that as is that I am a non interventionist hawk [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=454.58s)]
*  Which sounds a little weird, but but what do I mean by that? Oh my I mean the central touchpoint [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  For US foreign policy and for any question of military intervention [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=466.7s)]
*  Should be the extraction of natural resources and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=471.2s)]
*  the complete and utter [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=475.44s)]
*  humiliating domination of the global south so that we can continue abusing and abusing them for cheap and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=477.52s)]
*  Reliable labor, right? That's what he's gonna say [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=483.8s)]
*  I think be the vital national security interests of the United States by the way [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=486.12s)]
*  This is the same like liberal speak. This is soy speak for the record. What he's trying to do is basically [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=490.32s)]
*  Do what the Democrats do all the time, how does this make America safer? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=496.92s)]
*  How does this protect Americans if it does we should be strong and actually another way of [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=500.92s)]
*  Conceiving what I'm saying. I'm speaking theoretically [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=506.8s)]
*  but but Reagan referred to it as peace through strength and and actually I [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=509.44s)]
*  Think Donald Trump's foreign policy is very much what I'm describing a non interventionist hawk [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=514.12s)]
*  Where yeah famously non interventionist Ronald Reagan? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=520.2s)]
*  He understands that and I think this is historically true [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=524.46s)]
*  The best way to avoid war is being strong that weakness and isolationism I think [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=528.58s)]
*  encourages war so [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=535.5400000000001s)]
*  going back to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=537.98s)]
*  Regime change where you started in Iran [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  Sure, but just to me. I I don't think I disagree with anything you've said so we may not be that far apart really because you said [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=542.58s)]
*  that the single [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=549.0200000000001s)]
*  Criterion for making decisions about America's foreign policy is America's national interest. Yes, that's it. Yeah, which is also America first [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=551.5s)]
*  That's another way of putting that as well. That's the definition of it [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=558.1s)]
*  It's hardly breaking news. The US dollar has been great. We'll get that here. You love a command of a listen today [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=560.26s)]
*  The question is are we watching that now? So I think we are and and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=567.5s)]
*  from what you said publicly, I think on Iran in particular you and I disagree and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=572.6999999999999s)]
*  All right, let me contrast it when Obama was president when Obama was president [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=576.7s)]
*  You remember he talked about wanting to have military action against Syria. Mm-hmm [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=581.62s)]
*  And at the time I tried to keep an open mind to it [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=587.0200000000001s)]
*  I said, okay [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=589.3000000000001s)]
*  Let me listen to the commander-in-chief described to me how this is in America's interest and what your plan is and Bashar Assad [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=590.1s)]
*  Was a bad guy. He was killing his own citizens [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=597.3000000000001s)]
*  And and he had chemical weapons that were very dangerous I [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=600.98s)]
*  Could conceive of a commander-in-chief laying out a plan for okay. We're gonna go in and say [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=604.0600000000001s)]
*  Grab the chemical weapons and leave like I could see that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=609.74s)]
*  If there was a real threat to America and there was a plan to prevent that I could see supporting that so I wanted to hear [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=612.98s)]
*  what he said to say and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=618.14s)]
*  I listened both in classified briefings and public questioning and number one their public defensive [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=619.66s)]
*  It was a very dangerous thing to do [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=625.66s)]
*  Questioning and number one their public defensive it was incoherent. So [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=627.6999999999999s)]
*  John Kerry said we're going to engage in an unbelievably small strike. I think that's a quote [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=633.4599999999999s)]
*  Like okay and and to do what at the time? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=639.14s)]
*  There were nine major rebel Islamic groups in Syria. I'm like, okay, I agree but Shahzad's a bad guy you topple him and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=642.54s)]
*  One of the nine other groups takes over seven of them were affiliated with radical Islamic [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=649.54s)]
*  Had al-qaeda now Nusra like wait, how is it better? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=654.02s)]
*  To a good thing good thing. Those guys aren't in charge in Syria [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=658.66s)]
*  another [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=663.98s)]
*  another spectacular [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=665.3s)]
*  W for American foreign policy Ted Cruz. Are you oblivious to what's going on? He's like, oh man [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=666.9s)]
*  He'll be real shame if al-nusra took over Syria [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=673.98s)]
*  I mean those are radical Islamists have lunatics who hate us and I but I don't want worse guys in charge [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=677.62s)]
*  Yeah, we also were arming every single faction Obama administration couldn't give an answer to that and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=684.14s)]
*  Ultimately when you press them John Kerry in particular I pressed and he would say well [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=691.1800000000001s)]
*  We need to defend international norms. What the hell's an international norm? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=695.7s)]
*  I don't know what it is [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=700.38s)]
*  But I'm not interested in putting us servicemen and women in harm's way to defend one [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=701.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, so I opposed this the Syria attack and and and opposed it vocally and it was interesting Rand and I agreed Rand's a [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=705.62s)]
*  Friend of mine, but we we agreed with that position for different reasons [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=712.54s)]
*  What I was asking is is I think the question we should ask [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=716.66s)]
*  How does this make America safer the Obama administration couldn't give me an answer? So I opposed it [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=721.38s)]
*  I think Iran is very different. Let me ask what you think of how Syria wound up because [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=726.38s)]
*  Bishara said no lives in Moscow. Yeah, he was taken out by our allies [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=732.02s)]
*  And he's been replaced by a radical Islamist who was affiliated with Isis [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=736.38s)]
*  So is that a win or no? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=740.86s)]
*  Unclear it looks serious a mess. So I've consistently opposed but we had a secular. Yeah. Also [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=743.1s)]
*  what is intervention in [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=749.6600000000001s)]
*  the mind of [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=752.22s)]
*  an American senator [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=754.38s)]
*  because like to say that [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=756.74s)]
*  Intervention only comes in the form of direct strikes on Syria is insane [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=759.1s)]
*  Syria is one of the most intervened nations [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=764.0200000000001s)]
*  It was so intervened it's like that meme of [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=769.1800000000001s)]
*  you know [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=773.46s)]
*  the the American Special Forces doing a strike sending a strike team into a cartel territory and then ending up killing DEA [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=774.82s)]
*  Agents is like the CIA and DEA fighting against the American Special Forces [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  That's basically Syria [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=788.1800000000001s)]
*  We were arming every fucking side [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=790.6600000000001s)]
*  to the gills sometimes directly sometimes by way of Turkey [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=793.6600000000001s)]
*  And and offering them training [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=799.1800000000001s)]
*  Like we were a we were a part of the belligerents in every side with the exception [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=801.38s)]
*  I guess of Assad so is that not intervention do we consider that to be non interventionist? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=806.5s)]
*  Because I think that's intervention we were intervening quite a bit as a matter of fact, what is this? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=814.1s)]
*  Why did you send this to me pray for us? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=820.5400000000001s)]
*  Lol, no [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=823.26s)]
*  In a religious enough when you first sent me that I freaked out for a second. That was the first time [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=825.78s)]
*  Normally I say no, this is not correct, but that looks so much like Noah for a second. It freaked me out [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=831.98s)]
*  Like for a brief moment brief moment [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=841.34s)]
*  Okay [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=846.7s)]
*  You [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=848.7s)]
*  Clean diverse country now we have a religious extremist Islamic religious extremist [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=852.1800000000001s)]
*  Who's overseeing the purge of of Christians and Alawites? Is that better? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=856.98s)]
*  That doesn't seem well look one of the things you said is you said he was taken out by our allies [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=860.62s)]
*  I don't think that's right. Israel didn't take a sod out [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=864.94s)]
*  What happened and I'll tell you what about Turkey a turkey didn't take him out. So it's interesting. I had a long cut [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=868.1s)]
*  That's bullshit. That's that's fake who did then? Oh [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=873.5400000000001s)]
*  It's just a popular mobilization. It was a popular uprising. How did a soggy kicked out? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=877.62s)]
*  When when Netanyahu was in DC a couple of months ago, he and I sat down for a couple of hours [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=885.9399999999999s)]
*  He's a good friend of mine and and we talked actually about Syria [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=891.92s)]
*  It was he made an interesting point that I've not heard anywhere else in that. He said he believes what toppled Assad [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=895.38s)]
*  Was when Israel took out Nasrallah [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=903.28s)]
*  Nasrallah was the head of Hezbollah and they took about and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=906.42s)]
*  He and he made an interesting point [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=909.52s)]
*  He said it's fascinating how a charismatic leader and and BB said look Nasrallah was a very effective terrorist leader [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=911.24s)]
*  And when they took him out that power base was supporting Assad [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=918.16s)]
*  Only murderers were criminals that are aligned with America get to glaze Hassan Nasrallah [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=923.24s)]
*  When I say something that is factually accurate like he is charismatic and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=928.4s)]
*  also was incredibly well-read and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=933.4s)]
*  a [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=936.8399999999999s)]
*  solid tactician [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=937.92s)]
*  Everybody fucking turns around is like dire. You're glazing. You're glazing. You're glazing. You're glazing [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=939.7199999999999s)]
*  Fuck you. You love terrorism [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=944.56s)]
*  but when fucking Benjamin Netanyahu was a far greater evil and a far larger terrorist than his on as Rala actually is [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=946.16s)]
*  Like an actual terrorist straight up all of a sudden when he says that everyone's like nah that makes sense [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=954.56s)]
*  He's just showing respect [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=960.1199999999999s)]
*  and that [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=962.7199999999999s)]
*  Ultimately in BB's analysis remove the support for it from Assad and toppled him [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=964.28s)]
*  But they weren't trying to take out Assad my view now [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=969.4799999999999s)]
*  I don't know I actually you don't think that and I don't it is very confusing and I I don't know that anyone really knows [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=972.88s)]
*  all the details, but [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=979.0s)]
*  You don't think that Israel or Turkey or NATO ally Turkey works the other way around too [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=980.5999999999999s)]
*  You can praise Trump and no one will bat an eye. Did you just could make a comparison to Donald Trump? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=984.3599999999999s)]
*  Are you fucking insane? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=989.5999999999999s)]
*  Do you think you can go to jail if you say I like Donald Trump as president anywhere around the planet even in fucking Iran? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=991.0799999999999s)]
*  There are places around the planet where you could literally go to jail for saying you like Hassan Nasrallah [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=999.28s)]
*  Like saying anything remotely positive about Hassan Nasrallah he played any role in toppling Assad [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1007.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know that they did look look my understanding of that. They clearly took out [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1012.4000000000001s)]
*  Nasrallah and Hezbollah they've decimated you support terrorists over Israel isn't Israel justified to attack Iran [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1017.84s)]
*  No, and you support terrorists over the arch terrorists is a funny way to say this [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1024.88s)]
*  Israel is the greatest terrorist in the region [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1030.8s)]
*  America is the greatest terrorist around the planet Israel is the second greatest terrorist, you know in course indirect correspondence with the greatest terrorist [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1033.48s)]

*  Decimating Hezbollah was very good for Israel and very good for for America, too. I mean Hezbollah hated us [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1046.6000000000001s)]
*  I [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1052.2s)]

*  Let me step back and let's talk [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1073.28s)]
*  Regime change generally I I mentioned Syria [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1075.64s)]

*  And we have a pattern and going back to this binary of the interventionist and the isolationists [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1086.2s)]
*  The interventionists advocate over and over again. There's a bad guy [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1092.8s)]
*  There's a dictator who's doing bad things to his people and they say let's go top them and you have dictators in the Middle East [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1096.72s)]
*  Who are killing radical Islamic terrorists? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1102.52s)]
*  We come in and topple them the radical Islamic terrorists take over and they start killing Americans and my view how the heck does that help us? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1104.9199999999998s)]
*  like [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1112.32s)]
*  Saddam Hussein was a horrible human being he murdered and tortured people I [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1113.84s)]
*  unequivocally bad guy [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1118.36s)]
*  But it got much worse after we toppled him [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1119.96s)]
*  it's pretty funny to say this because like you could point to every American leadership and and say the exact same thing as [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1123.36s)]
*  A matter of fact if you recognize that then you understand why people on that side of the world will constantly say death to America [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1131.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay, if you want to understand why people over there say death to America [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1139.86s)]
*  This is the fucking reason and you ended up having ISIS rise up [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1144.54s)]
*  I mean that was the cause of ISIS was toppling Saddam Hussein same thing in in Libya. You had Gaddafi another horrible guy [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1149.3799999999999s)]
*  That that under Obama we toppled him and you ended up having radical Islamic warlords taking over and and so [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1156.74s)]
*  The quen it's the question I asked in Syria. Okay. Well, what's the plan? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1164.5s)]
*  And and and how is this good or bad for the United States? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1168.34s)]
*  And so I don't think with Iran I view Iran is very different from Iraq [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1172.3799999999999s)]
*  But up to that point you say we disagree. I I don't hear really anything [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1177.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm not quite sure what happened in Syria, but I don't know so right but other than that [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1181.06s)]
*  I don't hear anything. I disagree with that all. Yeah, sounds like we're in a complete agreement [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1185.1599999999999s)]
*  I wonder though is there that the United States supported that you're aware of in the last hundred years [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1188.5s)]
*  Sure [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1195.62s)]
*  defeating the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union collapsing winning the Cold War that that was the most [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1197.02s)]
*  consequential [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1204.34s)]
*  Step for US national security interests of our lifetimes [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1205.54s)]
*  Okay, and so you would classify that as a regime change that we affected. Absolutely. Okay, and [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1209.98s)]
*  Look you and I are in my office [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1217.06s)]
*  We're sitting next to a painting of Reagan in front of the Brandenburg Gate and and up top [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1219.18s)]
*  Are the words tear down this wall in German in the style of the graffiti, right? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1225.66s)]
*  and I think those are the most important words any leader has said in modern times and and if if you look at how [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1231.7s)]
*  Reagan waged the Cold War and and Reagan is very much my model for how to [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1238.18s)]
*  Actually think how Reagan took on the Soviet Union is exactly how we should take on China [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1244.18s)]
*  Now starting from the point look Reagan was not an interventionist in eight years. The biggest country Reagan ever invaded was Grenada [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1248.9s)]
*  Bro, he's like [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1257.58s)]
*  Reagan's interventions took out the USSR and they were awesome [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1259.98s)]
*  Also, look Reagan was not an interventionist. So which is it dude? I understand why Iran hates expats. Why isn't ice? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1265.3400000000001s)]
*  Deporting anchor, baby Ted Cruz didn't Reagan do Iran Contra. He does not consider [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1273.2199999999998s)]
*  He does not consider that to be intervention [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1278.6999999999998s)]
*  What he considers to be intervention is like direct boosts on the ground military warfare that much is clear [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1281.26s)]
*  Which Reagan did plenty of as well [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1287.1s)]
*  But also a lot of covert operations took place under the watchful gaze of George HW Bush. So [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1289.58s)]
*  When he says Reagan was a non interventionist, I think he means like we want we need more [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1297.58s)]
*  Sophisticated we need uh, we need more sophisticated ops [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1301.42s)]
*  He was very reluctant to use us military force. He didn't respond after the 83 barracks bombings. You're right [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1306.38s)]
*  He made the judgment that the risk exceeded the benefits and and that's a very [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1311.9s)]
*  Rational decision to make and it's reflected. Trump has made those same decisions where [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1317.26s)]
*  He is willing to use military force, but but he very much asks [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1323.02s)]
*  Okay, is this good or bad for America does this endanger u.s. Servicemen and women or not? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1327.82s)]
*  And one of the points about the cold war look nobody in their right mind [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1334.1399999999999s)]
*  Wanted a shooting war between America and the Soviet Union the two biggest nuclear powers on earth [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1338.78s)]
*  Firing bullets at each other is really unhealthy for human beings [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1343.6599999999999s)]
*  Same thing is true with China. Nobody with any sense says hey, let's go to war with China. That's really dumb [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1347.82s)]
*  Dude you just said it i'm so dude he is contradicting himself [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1353.26s)]
*  Non-stop he's like reagan was not interventionist his interventions took out the ussr [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1361.42s)]
*  Well, nobody should go to war with china [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1366.62s)]
*  We should actually take out the uh take out china in the same way that we did ussr through a sequence of interventions [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1369.02s)]
*  During that we did during the cold war we should do a cold war with china. Yeah, here is non-interventionist [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1375.58s)]
*  Ronald mcdonald reagan [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1381.28s)]
*  These are the these are the wonderful men he called uh the he compared to the founding fathers [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1386.08s)]
*  Um and a whole lot of people could die [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1393.76s)]
*  But the cold war showed we've got lots of tools short of sending the marines [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1396.8s)]
*  to fight against a regime [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1402.88s)]
*  And one of the most important tools is the bully pulpit [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1405.04s)]
*  And so when I say I support regime change [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1408.4s)]
*  I actually think just simply that laying out what the ayatollah does and so I spend a lot of time [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1410.96s)]
*  I speak to iranian dissident groups. I speak out against human rights abuses. I think shining a light [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1416.88s)]
*  On the depravity of leaders is a really powerful tool that america has [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1424.0800000000002s)]
*  Should it should we limit our activity to that? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1429.1200000000001s)]
*  It it depends again that these because the u.s government pays [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1433.44s)]
*  Opposition groups militarized opposition groups in iran to overthrow the government [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1438.64s)]
*  We've done a lot of different places as you know [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1443.2s)]
*  I'm not i'm not saying it's bad, but that's very different from what you're describing [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1445.52s)]
*  You're saying we're making a moral case as we did for 70 years with the soviets. Our system works yours doesn't [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1448.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1453.68s)]
*  Um, and I think we made a credible case for that and we beat them over 70 years economically [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1454.48s)]
*  And that was a huge part of it [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1460.16s)]
*  Right. I think everyone agree. That was the main part of it. We didn't beat them in vietnam [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1461.92s)]
*  Ah north korea the main part of it, but it was tied to a military build-up. So I think it was two things [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1466.0800000000002s)]
*  It was one the clarity so reagan came in [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1471.68s)]
*  And he described the soviet union as an evil empire, right? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1474.64s)]
*  and [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1478.0800000000002s)]
*  dude [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1479.04s)]
*  What a silly assessment. Yeah, ronald reagan was a grade a yapper [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1480.48s)]
*  gay [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1487.28s)]
*  That's how he did it. He had the gift of gab and he just yapped about [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1488.56s)]
*  And that's how he was able to topple the ussr [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1493.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's what it is is not like any of these covert ops [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1497.04s)]
*  Not the things that you're talking about right now that you're trying to do unsuccessfully in iran [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1501.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1507.04s)]
*  He literally just said, you know, I talked to dissident groups iranian dissident groups all the time. And well, what the what do you mean? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1508.08s)]
*  Like that's not an organic formation [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1514.32s)]
*  The moment that you uh the moment that you are involved in their activities [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1516.8s)]
*  It turns into intervention. The difference here is I guess what uh, what what tecruz is trying to say [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1522.1000000000001s)]
*  is uh, he considers [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1529.54s)]
*  covert operations and and like destabilization operations regime change [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1532.42s)]
*  arming [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1538.02s)]
*  Dissident groups and and different factions beefing up sectarian and fighting things like that [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1539.06s)]
*  Are not considered intervention, which I obviously disagree with that's so stupid. Of course this intervention is just [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1544.58s)]
*  I guess I guess uh, you know the difference now is america doesn't have the same motion that it once did [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1551.46s)]
*  all of the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1557.94s)]
*  Intelligency in dc all the democrats all the media. They're like what a horrible thing to say. You can't say that reagan [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1559.52s)]
*  Uh went to the united kingdom and he said marxism leninism will end up on the ash heap of history people were horrified [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1565.46s)]
*  They asked him. All right, what's what's your strategy in the cold war? He said very simple. We win they lose [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1572.58s)]
*  and that was all viewed as as [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1578.02s)]
*  Sort of a philistine simplicity [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1580.98s)]
*  And I think it was exactly right and laying that out speaking [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1584.18s)]
*  Do you know the backstory behind the the berlin wall speech? Yeah, I do. Yes, you probably know peter robinson who was a speech writer. Yes [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1588.9s)]
*  So three times the state department deleted those words from that speech [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1596.1s)]
*  And three times reagan wrote it back [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1601.22s)]
*  And the state department argued they said mr president you can't say this this is too bellicose [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1603.78s)]
*  This is too provocative and my favorite they said this is too unrealistic will stand till the end of time [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1608.02s)]
*  And reagan said look, this is the whole point of the speech [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1615.46s)]
*  And less than three years after reagan gave that speech the berlin wall was torn to the ground [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1619.22s)]
*  And it wasn't knocked down by american army tanks. We didn't shoot missiles at it. It was shining truth and light [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1624.34s)]
*  That tore it down. It was also [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1632.58s)]
*  Rebuilding the american military it was [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1635.36s)]
*  What was then pejoratively called star wars where the soviet union their economy couldn't match our military build-up and it bankrupted them [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1638.6599999999999s)]
*  That's an example of peace through strength [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1646.26s)]
*  I wonder I mean is there anybody who was alive in 1989 who wouldn't trade that america for the one we live in now [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1648.4199999999998s)]
*  There's not one person. I don't think oh sure. Uh, but I mean just the basic metrics debt suicide rate life expectancy [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1654.1s)]
*  It was I wonder why after that victory america didn't [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1662.3400000000001s)]
*  Thrive in the way that we thought that it would that I thought that it would my family was involved in that [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1667.78s)]
*  I mean, we're very focused on it in my house. Like one and I [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1671.94s)]
*  I wonder two things why didn't [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1675.22s)]
*  the united states kind of declare victory and make some sort of [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1677.54s)]
*  Uh arrangement with russia that allowed like mutual prosperity rather than continuing a cold war and second. I wonder why the united states [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1681.46s)]
*  Didn't get a lot better like why don't we have better infrastructure? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1688.9s)]
*  Why don't we if you were homeless, why do we have all these drugs like if we won? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1691.3799999999999s)]
*  Why does our country look like this? I walked across from union station this morning as you do i'm sure every day [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1694.1s)]
*  I know there's people lying in this. Yes. His family was involved in that his dad is cia [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1699.3799999999999s)]
*  His dad is literally cia [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1703.3s)]
*  The street sleeping outside it's like what is that we're starting to say it but this is not a very safe country people [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1708.98s)]
*  Dot-com [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1716.1s)]
*  There's no doubt there are [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1718.58s)]
*  Really dangerous forces in our society. Some of it is politics and some of it is culture [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1721.22s)]
*  And one of the mistakes people make in politics is thinking everything is politics [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1725.86s)]
*  so the political answer which I happen to believe is is we went much further down the road of liberalism you look at bill clinton [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1730.02s)]
*  who inherited the peace dividend of the cold war being over and and [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1736.98s)]
*  Moved us more to the left and then obama accelerated it a lot. So there are lots of I agree bad economic policies [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1741.54s)]
*  But I also think they're cultural things [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1747.54s)]
*  Um, you know the the the loss of faith I agree with all of family [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1749.94s)]
*  I know what you're gonna say and I agree 100. I bet there's not one word that I would disagree with all i'm saying is [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1753.86s)]
*  Like I think it's important to step back and ask but I actually think russia has very little to do with it [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1759.54s)]
*  So that's kind of the point that i'm trying to make which is like we're all sort of focused on beating our adversaries abroad [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1763.3799999999999s)]
*  But what is victory worth if our own country becomes what it is now? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1769.3799999999999s)]
*  Maybe we're spending a little too much time focused abroad and not enough time focused on the people sleeping outside union station [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1773.14s)]
*  So look, I absolutely think we need to focus at home [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1779.8600000000001s)]
*  Emphatically and we need to focus on prosperity. We need to focus on reducing the debt reducing spending empowering people [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1784.24s)]
*  Low taxes small businesses american free enterprise. It's the most powerful force for fighting poverty. The world has ever seen i'm [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1790.9s)]
*  A thousand percent there [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1798.8200000000002s)]
*  Oh my fucking lord [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1801.22s)]
*  I also recognize it is a dangerous world and and [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1803.6200000000001s)]
*  part of the responsibility of leaders part of president trump's responsibility [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1807.46s)]
*  Is to keep america safe, but let's go back to where we started with [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1811.94s)]
*  You've been in the district a long time in dc so have I [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1815.6200000000001s)]
*  And the city's way more dangerous and congress runs this no, it's a complete crap hole [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1818.74s)]
*  So i'm saying like the date no iranians ever gonna kill me, but I could get carjacked here [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1822.5s)]
*  And I just don't understand how the congress could run the city and focus on the dangers of iran [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1827.46s)]
*  When the city is like garbage, it's garbage, but but congress congress doesn't run the city they we could [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1832.34s)]
*  Congress does run the city. It's in the constitution. It's in the constitution, but they've given home rule [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1837.62s)]
*  So it's a democrat mayor back you control the congress. I vote for it, but but but it is a question of math [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1842.02s)]
*  Okay, but i'm just saying like why how can people ignore? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1847.7s)]
*  It's like if my own kids are drug addicts, but i'm focused on my neighbor's kids [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1851.78s)]
*  It's like i'm neglecting my own kids and there's a sense in which [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1855.38s)]
*  The congress is neglecting the country that elected them in favor of this relentless focus on other people's problems [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1858.3400000000001s)]
*  That's the way it feels as an america [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1865.22s)]
*  look [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1867.5400000000002s)]
*  There are lots of problems in america that we need to fix. Why is is dc a pit? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1869.0600000000002s)]
*  Because you have a mayor and a democrat city council that won't let police officers arrest bad guys and in every city [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1874.42s)]
*  You see across the country whether it's new york whether it's chicago whether it's la whether it's san francisco [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1879.5400000000002s)]
*  If you have [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1884.5800000000002s)]
*  Democrats, we see the la riots where they won't let people be arrested. All right, then why not work in regime change here? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1885.94s)]
*  Why not use the bully? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1892.9s)]
*  What do you think I do every day? I never see a republican senator stand up and say [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1894.42s)]
*  I just walked to work this morning over people dying of drug ods. We're gonna shut this place down unless they fix it [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1898.3400000000001s)]
*  There's they're mad about putin like what did putin do to washington? Nothing [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1903.46s)]
*  Look in terms of regime change, let's let's talk this week the the the riots in la [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1907.7s)]
*  I've made very clear that the cause of those riots are gavin newson and karen bass and when you elect communists who hate america [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1913.86s)]
*  Who stopped long when you elect? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1920.4199999999998s)]
*  Communists like karen bass and gavin newson, dude. What planet are right wingers? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1923.2s)]
*  Existing on I will never understand. It's not this one. Let me tell you [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1929.6799999999998s)]
*  Okay [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1934.82s)]
*  It certainly ain't the one that we're on [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1935.94s)]
*  Unforced from arresting criminals you get what you get on the man. I agree [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1938.6599999999999s)]
*  My in-laws are californians and they're wonderful people that heidi grew up in the central coast of california and I remember I was [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1942.8200000000002s)]
*  texting with with my my mother-in-law and and I think I sent her a video of [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1949.3s)]
*  criminals going to a store and just looting in california [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1954.4s)]
*  And and her response she said something like well, this is this is really terrible. I it's I I wish we could it's a shame [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1958.3400000000001s)]
*  We can't do anything about this [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1963.54s)]
*  So yes, you can go in and arrest them throw their butts in jail put them in handcuffs and it stops exactly [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1965.22s)]
*  and so [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1971.6200000000001s)]
*  We know how to fix these things and and dc is is I think dc voted if I remember right 92 Democrat [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1972.82s)]
*  um [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1980.66s)]
*  Democrat policies don't work and they destroy [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1981.54s)]
*  Every community that they are in charge of they why don't republicans assert their constitutional authority over the city? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1984.74s)]
*  Don't they control the congress? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1991.7s)]
*  Yes, i'd be all for it. Who's against it. Uh, susan collins is really vocally against it [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1993.6200000000001s)]
*  Uh, so on questions of home rules [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=1999.46s)]
*  So for example, let's take an issue you and I care a lot about the covet lockdowns [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2001.06s)]
*  I had a couple of years ago in the middle of them [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2005.46s)]
*  uh [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2008.1s)]
*  DC was proposing the dc school district was proposing throwing out of school [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2009.3s)]
*  Any child that was not vaccinated? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2014.74s)]
*  And at the time if I remember correctly it was something like 40 percent of the african-american students in dc [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2017.06s)]
*  Were not vaccinated so they're talking about literally throwing out 40 percent of the kids at public school [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2022.82s)]
*  And so I had a vote on the senate floor to say look they can't throw kids out of school for this [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2027.38s)]
*  And we ended up having a big by the way, we interrupt this broadcast because uh, here is footage [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2032.8200000000002s)]
*  from a ship that was apparently staffed by indian personnel [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2039.3000000000002s)]
*  In missile salvo against israel the footage appears to show impacts in the distance [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2044.66s)]
*  Although it was claimed that all missiles were intercepted [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2048.1s)]
*  So remember when the israeli government says that all of the missiles are being intercepted. They're fucking lying [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2050.5s)]
*  Okay [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2056.5s)]
*  That's one [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2057.62s)]
*  I think that went a bit two three [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2066.42s)]
*  I don't know if this is from a couple nights ago from last night, but uh, they they constantly [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2072.9s)]
*  It could be it it could be from a uh, it could be from a couple nights ago [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2080.58s)]
*  but when [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2086.9s)]
*  When israel says missiles are being intercepted a fresh angle of the israel-iran conflict to serve is captured by an indian merchant [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2088.02s)]
*  Navy ship providing rare and unprecedented visuals from the high seas. This is the same one. I think [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2093.86s)]
*  Okay [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2116.1s)]
*  Those are the big boys that are supposed to intercept I think the ballistic missiles [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2123.62s)]
*  Oh [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2146.18s)]
*  We saw this part [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2153.94s)]
*  Damn that one's fast as fuck [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2161.06s)]
*  Yeah [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2163.14s)]
*  Is probably old [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2174.82s)]
*  I think a lot of these are I think a lot of these uh strikes are probably old because I don't think iran has been [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2176.66s)]
*  iran has been um [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2183.7s)]
*  Lobbing this many missiles at all since the first couple of days. This one is probably even older [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2185.7799999999997s)]
*  But yeah, I mean they are israel is definitely israel is definitely I think that's from last night the the indian ship [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2193.06s)]
*  They are conscious while manufacturing these laws or they believe what they're saying [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2200.66s)]
*  No when israel says oh we're intercepting all the missiles [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2205.06s)]
*  and [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2208.82s)]
*  Uh when when they say oh we're we're intercepting all the missiles and and you know, none of them are hitting their targets at all [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2209.54s)]
*  That you should apply a healthy dose of scrutiny to statements such as that one [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2217.7s)]
*  Argument and part of the argument was home rule [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2224.02s)]
*  Where there was and susan was the most vocal republican. It's like no no, we have to let dc run and i'm like why cop come [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2226.82s)]
*  And it ended up by the way every single democrat all of them [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2233.2999999999997s)]
*  Voted in favor of the dc public schools being able to throw out [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2237.14s)]
*  40 of the black kids from school and I said look you throw a kid out of school [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2240.98s)]
*  You got a 14 15 year old boy. You throw him out of school. You know, what's gonna happen next? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2245.14s)]

*  He could be dead within five years [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2252.8199999999997s)]
*  If that kid doesn't get an education and the democrats were more than happy to say we don't care [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2255.38s)]
*  Right now our religion is get get the vaccine or we're to hell with you [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=2259.62s)]

*  But I also think at this point given where we are. It's fair to ask rational questions about what the benefits are good [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3386.24s)]
*  Um [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3391.68s)]
*  so [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3393.2s)]
*  Does massage share all of its intelligence with us? Oh probably not but they share a lot [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3394.48s)]
*  Um, we don't share all of our intelligence with them, but we share a lot [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3398.8799999999997s)]
*  It's a close ally. Do they spy domestically in the united states? Oh, they probably do and we do is what do you mean? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3401.6s)]
*  Probably they absolutely do fuck. You mean probably bitch. You know that they do [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3406.7999999999997s)]
*  You know that they do. What do you mean? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3412.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh my god, so fucking cucked, holy shit [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3416.0s)]
*  And friends and allies spy on each other and and I assume I assume all of our allies spy on us that's okay with you [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3420.16s)]
*  You know what one of the things about being a conservative is that you're not naive and utopian [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3426.4s)]
*  You don't think humans are all part of the reason socialism doesn't work is is [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3431.92s)]
*  The the the mantra from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs doesn't work as a conservative [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3436.4s)]
*  I assume people act in their rational self-interest. It's why the free market to pay people to spy on you [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3442.16s)]
*  It's conservative to recognize that human beings act to their own self-interest and every one of our friends spies on us [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3447.68s)]
*  And i'm not do you like it? That's my question. I'm not asking whether they have motive to do it. Of course they do [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3453.6s)]
*  I understand that and I and by the way, i'm not mad at them, but you're an american lawmaker [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3458.56s)]
*  So I just want to know hold on. I want to know your attitude [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3463.12s)]
*  You said that your guiding principle in fact the only principle the only criterion [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3466.3999999999996s)]
*  That's a guiding the the overwhelming. I wouldn't say only is is it in america's interest? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3471.36s)]
*  Is it in america's interest for israel to spy on us including on the president? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3475.28s)]
*  um, it is in america's interest to be [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3478.7200000000003s)]
*  closely allied with israel because [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3482.46s)]
*  We get huge benefits for it and you want to want to see the clear [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3485.6800000000003s)]
*  But I just want to stop on this fine for a second that it takes place as you know [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3488.96s)]
*  um and including on the president of the united states and several precedents and [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3493.1200000000003s)]
*  I just want to know if that's okay. And why is it okay? Wouldn't an american lawmaker say to a client state? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3497.92s)]
*  You're not allowed to spy on us. I'm sorry. I know why you want to i'm not mad at you [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3504.0s)]
*  But you're not allowed to sure and I don't care for it. I don't want to be spied on by you is that [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3506.88s)]
*  It's kind of weird not to say that but you don't seem able to say that [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3512.0s)]
*  Sure, I would say don't spy on us. They're going to anyway [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3516.24s)]
*  And by the way, the brits are the canadians are like I don't think well i'm not for that at all [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3518.4s)]
*  I think it's disgusting but we don't actually pay their [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3522.88s)]
*  You know, we're not their most meaningful sponsor. We're not sort of paying for the operations [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3526.3199999999997s)]
*  I gotta say and this is it's weird [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3530.56s)]
*  We're talking about isolationist the obsession with israel. Why is israel? I don't think i'm obsessed with this [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3534.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay, but I think a lot of people are and like the question israel spies bro straight up [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3540.0s)]
*  Straight up israel is at the heart of so many contradictions [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3545.04s)]
*  That it it bricks every politician [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3550.3199999999997s)]
*  Liberal democrat conservative republican alike [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3554.42s)]
*  You start scratching the surface [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3558.8199999999997s)]
*  of the the [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3561.54s)]
*  fealty and loyalty that american politicians demonstrate towards israel [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3563.2999999999997s)]
*  and the allowance [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3568.02s)]
*  That the american government gives israel to do a bunch of fuck shit [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3569.62s)]
*  And you start talking about like why are they allowed to be this favored client state? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3574.9s)]
*  And they just brick their brain fucking short circuits [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3579.54s)]
*  This is perhaps the major reason as to why all of these conversations need to be stamped out before they're had [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3583.46s)]
*  And the most effective way of doing that is by tying this back to anti-semitism [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3590.98s)]
*  Which is ironically one of the [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3597.46s)]
*  This is ironically the reason why [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3600.98s)]
*  anti-semitism and and [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3604.16s)]
*  Combating anti-semitism has been one of the only [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3606.16s)]
*  Real bigotries that is effectively [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3612.0s)]
*  Weaponized and defended by both parties my argument as always is not because [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3616.54s)]
*  Americans just have a special status for jews for the record like american politicians or whatever or they're like legitimately [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3622.3799999999997s)]
*  Super careful about jews because they're in positions of power or anything like that [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3630.56s)]
*  But instead [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3635.2s)]
*  directly as a consequence of what I just mentioned which is it's the most effective way of stopping that question [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3636.62s)]
*  entirely by us by associating israel with judaism [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3643.74s)]
*  and and criticisms of israel being packaged as [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3649.04s)]
*  anti-semitic [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3653.34s)]
*  If there was no israel [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3657.6s)]
*  If israel did not exist in the violent ways that it does if like [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3659.68s)]
*  Jews were allowed to peacefully migrate and it wasn't about like a violent settler colonial enterprise [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3663.92s)]
*  The american government would not give a fuck about anti-semitism at all [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3670.88s)]
*  if that was not a a foothold in this region if israel was not a foothold in this region a [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3677.12s)]
*  a [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3683.44s)]
*  Unsinkable aircraft carrier with his own espionage facilities, but it was simply a diverse country mixed with [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3684.08s)]
*  christians muslims and jews [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3690.86s)]
*  Okay in the in the initial commitment that the likes of albert einstein had post world war two [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3693.76s)]
*  american [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3700.86s)]
*  Governments the american government or the institutions would treat [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3702.22s)]
*  Anti-semitism in the same exact way that they would treat like any other form of bigotry with no care or consideration [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3707.04s)]
*  What so ever okay? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3714.56s)]
*  Damn, you're just gonna drop another hard j my guy. What do you mean? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3718.0s)]
*  What is a hard j? Why do you keep saying that don't you mean einstein you piece of shit? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3722.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3728.7999999999997s)]
*  j's job that's why there's no comparison [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3730.08s)]
*  between [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3734.3199999999997s)]
*  Any other real bigotry because anti-semitism is a real bigotry right it has caused historically [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3735.84s)]
*  Tremendous harm to jewish people from pogroms to the holocaust [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3742.8s)]
*  The reason why it has so much institutional power as opposed to any other kind of bigotry [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3749.12s)]
*  And it's like also defended by republicans and democrats alike [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3757.04s)]
*  Is because of how it is used? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3762.08s)]
*  in modern american political discourse as a stopgap measure to stop people dead in their tracks from ever [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3765.28s)]
*  Investigating why? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3774.7000000000003s)]
*  america's foreign policy relies on israel and why israel gets to do all of these ridiculous things [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3776.7200000000003s)]
*  And why american politicians don't say anything about it as well so does every other country. Why are you mad at israel? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3784.48s)]
*  I guess oh no no i'm i'm just [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3790.48s)]

*  So apac raises a lot of money for me, but it's actually a misnomer because the people who raise money are individuals [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3799.44s)]
*  So it's not the pack itself, but they're individual members. Oh [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3805.28s)]
*  Shit my bad bro didn't realize [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3809.76s)]

*  You have to defend israel. It's a [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3889.06s)]
*  phenomenally important part of a [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3891.6000000000004s)]

*  um that plays a big role [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3898.42s)]
*  But also the notion that like apac doesn't play a formative role and that's and they gave ted cruz [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=3900.7400000000002s)]

*  And and the iran nuclear deal I think was catastrophic [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4503.240000000001s)]
*  And apac went all in lobbying against yeah [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4507.02s)]

*  When I got here there used to be real [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4586.54s)]
*  It's funny because like there are a lot of people who literally believe that like maybe not tito is yugoslavia [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4588.46s)]
*  But like there are people who legitimately think that i'm funded by hamas and iran [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4593.74s)]
*  No, who these shout out l I did I gave him a shout out the ansar allah movement. Okay, calm down [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4599.66s)]

*  like people still do the um [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4613.82s)]
*  people people still post that one, uh time when I was like [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4616.7s)]
*  When the when the beat drops the spirit of jihad also is restored in me or something like that [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4621.34s)]
*  I was saying when I was watching one of the ansar allah music videos and someone unironically like that's a clip that they use [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4627.34s)]
*  Unironically like over and over again. What was it? What did I forget what I said? It was very funny at the time [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4633.5599999999995s)]
*  bipartisan support for israel that has largely disappeared [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4639.799999999999s)]
*  And it's the obama nuclear deal that caused it because the obama white house told every democrat pick [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4644.32s)]
*  You either stand with israel [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4649.92s)]
*  Or you're a democrat and you stand with the obama white house and almost every single democrat member of congress said i'm a democrat first [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4651.839999999999s)]
*  to hell with israel [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4657.839999999999s)]
*  And then I watched as apac [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4659.36s)]
*  every one of those democrats got reelected and apac did nothing about it and and it [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4662.08s)]
*  Dramatically reduced apac's influence. It would be I watched it happen. And by the way, I told apac I said look [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4666.62s)]
*  the analogy if the nra [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4673.04s)]
*  Was supporting a bunch of politicians and cared about the second amendment and you had politics [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4675.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, I said when the beat drops you can feel the jihad drop in your heart [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4679.04s)]
*  Anyone that takes that seriously is the stupidest person on the planet missions that vote to confiscate people's guns [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4682.88s)]
*  And the nra turned around and raised money [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4689.280000000001s)]
*  For the people who voted to confiscate guns, you know what? No one would ever care what they said again [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4692.400000000001s)]
*  Sure, you're making the he's saying he's a dick rider for israel without the money in the same way that many people [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4697.12s)]
*  Are already pro second amendment unconditionally and the nra gives them a decent amount of money. It's not the actual lobby [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4703.12s)]
*  He's not wrong for the record [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4709.68s)]
*  It's a little bit of both [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4711.84s)]
*  but [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4713.6s)]
*  I always say this I always do this [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4714.4800000000005s)]
*  these lobbies [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4717.04s)]
*  exist [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4718.64s)]
*  not for [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4720.16s)]
*  Times of no conflict these lobbies exist to write legislation [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4721.84s)]
*  Oftentimes quietly as apac has [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4725.62s)]
*  Where there are anti bds laws in numerous states in america, but these lobbies exist in times [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4728.9s)]
*  like right now [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4736.66s)]
*  Okay [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4738.74s)]
*  when politicians are pressured [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4739.78s)]
*  by the public [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4742.58s)]
*  to actually make democratic changes [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4744.099999999999s)]
*  And and they choose not to because they are one one worried about like their opposition being funded [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4747.46s)]
*  And two they're worried about their money not coming down the line and three they've already developed loyalties to these lobbyists [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4754.66s)]
*  That is the the major role that apac or the nra plays [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4762.42s)]
*  Like for example, there have been numerous instances [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4767.0599999999995s)]
*  Where you see what the zoomers are cooking? Oh, I saw this one. Yes [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4771.7s)]
*  there have been numerous instances where [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4775.94s)]
*  politicians were there were people demanding action from their politicians in terms of sensible gun control legislation [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4778.72s)]
*  Post sandy hook is a great example of this where all of these nra funded politicians didn't actually [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4785.139999999999s)]
*  Didn't actually [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4792.66s)]
*  Respond to the public pressure because they were getting a ton of money from the nra [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4795.04s)]
*  That's where that is where the the lobby [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4802.0199999999995s)]
*  A [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4807.08s)]
*  That's a million likes that's crazy [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4813.96s)]
*  Case that apac is not as powerful as people say it is and I completely agree with you [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4817.32s)]
*  I've watched that and i'm not i'm not making the case that apac is all powerful and they're running [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4820.76s)]
*  Everything and putting flora in the water. I'm not making the case at all because it's not true [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4825.5599999999995s)]
*  i'm only trying to get to the question of what apac is and I don't think you're being straightforward about it apac is [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4829.08s)]
*  Lobbying on behalf of the interests of a foreign country and they're not registered and you're saying no, that's not true [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4834.28s)]
*  You're saying that they don't coordinate with the israeli government coordinate that they do they talk with them [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4839.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know what they do. I can tell you why don't you care? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4844.84s)]
*  Isn't it meaningful if a foreign government? Hey, I talk with with israel all the time [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4848.04s)]
*  I talk with you of course you do countries all the time [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4852.44s)]
*  But the law is and a lot of people have prosecuted under this law that if you are lobbying on behalf of foreign government [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4854.36s)]
*  You must register. That's it. It's really simple and I don't know why [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4859.4s)]
*  If i'm working from malaysia or qatar or belgium [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4862.4400000000005s)]
*  And i'm working on behalf of its government's interests through a group of americans who are representing the friendship between those two nations [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4866.76s)]
*  I have to register under the foreign agent registration act and if I don't I can go to jail and people have gone to jail [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4873.64s)]
*  Including people I know okay, so I don't understand why we don't just be honest and say [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4877.96s)]
*  They're a lobbying on behalf of foreign government. They're coordinating with the government. You know that that's true. That is not only not true. That is false [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4883.16s)]
*  They're not coordinating with the israeli government. Do you do you know how apac raises money? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4890.12s)]
*  What for for elected officials like what they do like what the actual mechanics is [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4895.08s)]
*  I mean they go to people who are sympathetic to israel and raise money and then send it to candidates who agree with them [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4898.84s)]
*  So what they'll do is so in my last election apac endorsed me [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4903.96s)]
*  And they'll host a fundraiser and they'll host a fundraiser in dallas or houston or atlanta or new york or la [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4908.28s)]
*  And they'll do a fundraiser and they'll get someone who'll host it and it's usually a business owner lawyer doctor someone who host it [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4914.200000000001s)]
*  And you'll get typically at an apac fundraiser [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4920.6s)]
*  30 40 50 maybe 100 people who live in that city, right? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4924.04s)]
*  Who care about a strong us israel relationship and and if they have you know 50 people each of them writes a thousand dollar check [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4927.8s)]
*  And you raise 50 000. Yeah, i've been to an apac fundraiser. I know what it looks like, but but that is not and by the way [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4934.280000000001s)]
*  There's no representative the israeli government there you have when you're in dallas you're meeting with false and silly conversation [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4941.320000000001s)]
*  I know all this I know all this the question is is are apex goals shaped [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4947.080000000001s)]
*  By the goals of the israeli government to any extent [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4951.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay, that's a really simple question from lobbying on behalf of a simple question [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4954.040000000001s)]
*  That is ape are apex goals shaped by the goals of the israeli government and it's pretty wild [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4957.8s)]
*  That in order to try and defend this position [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4964.52s)]
*  You have to behave like the audience is moronic [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4967.24s)]
*  Like I don't think there's a single person that will listen to this back and forth conversation [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4973.32s)]
*  And leave the conversation thinking yeah take crews did a really good job there actually [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4979.08s)]
*  Yeah, now I actually don't think apac is the israel lobby [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4983.639999999999s)]
*  And is is directly dominating american politicians like oh it's just a series of of [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4988.5199999999995s)]
*  polite [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4997.16s)]
*  totally unrelated [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=4998.76s)]
*  Circumstantial coincidences [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5001.7s)]
*  That that happened to align perfectly [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5004.28s)]
*  Totally involuntarily, you know and all the people that work for the israeli state that then go and work at apec [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5007.88s)]
*  that [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5015.639999999999s)]
*  That's just also a coincidence and uh totally yeah, just a just a little mishap there [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5017.4s)]
*  I'm just gonna ask you a question straightforwardly and if you say no, I think we both know that's not true [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5024.2s)]
*  Are they shaped by is that are they coordinating with the israeli government? Are they talking with them? [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5028.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, is really directing them. What are you want to talk about farah the law on lobbying on behalf of someone? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5034.04s)]
*  It is I hire you and you lobby on behalf of me. I direct you does israel direct apac [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5040.04s)]
*  No, they're not lobbying on behalf of them. Do they care about them? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5045.08s)]
*  For what it's worth I don't think apac should register as a foreign agent because apac's problem isn't that their direct arm of the israeli government [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5049.24s)]
*  The problem is that they exist to destroy any form of questioning against the u.s's relationship with an apartheid state [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5053.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that but also I think yes apac should be destroyed [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5059.32s)]
*  It's like not not register as a foreign agent. I'll start i'll start with that, but I think it should be illegal [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5062.92s)]
*  I think apac should be illegal [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5070.6s)]
*  It should not exist [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5073.400000000001s)]
*  No form of the israel lobby should exist [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5075.4s)]
*  No form of any lobby if america is this like bastion of liberal democracy [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5079.48s)]
*  No form of any lobby that directly contradicts that should exist and before people say what about china? It doesn't exist [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5084.92s)]
*  Okay, and americans would literally tell you exactly why it doesn't exist and they would say that with a straight face [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5091.24s)]
*  If you're like, what do you mean a china lobby? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5097.879999999999s)]
*  Uh, you mean an authoritarian dictatorship like china? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5099.879999999999s)]
*  Could lobby our beautiful government and it's like [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5104.36s)]
*  Okay. Well, what about israel then? Yes, but [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5107.24s)]
*  Do you think that it's just interesting because what you're now describing in a very defensive way? I will say is [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5110.679999999999s)]
*  Foreign influence over our politics now and you began and it's so transparently obvious to everybody [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5117.32s)]
*  I don't know why you would be embarrassed of it. You've said that you are sincerely for israel [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5123.4s)]
*  I believe you I don't think you have some weird agenda you seem to [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5126.28s)]
*  Did you say apac doesn't have a right to exist? How dare you? I mean [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5129.639999999999s)]
*  Wait till you hear what I have to say about the eye in apac and whether it has a right to exist [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5133.879999999999s)]
*  The answer is no it does not okay [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5140.44s)]
*  Just so you know, it's have to justify their existence by defending its population [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5143.4s)]
*  Okay, and by how it treats other populations [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5148.599999999999s)]
*  You can't just be a state that occupies an indigenous population and dominates them for 77 years [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5152.28s)]
*  I'd be like, oh don't I have a right to exist? Look at me little old me. How dare you? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5157.879999999999s)]
*  It's like no, you don't have a right to exist out of here. You're an apartheid doing a genocide [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5162.76s)]
*  Of course, you don't have the right to exist. Does jews have a right to exist? Yes [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5166.280000000001s)]
*  What kind of stupid question is this my man said? Oh, you don't think israel has a right to exist as an apartheid state [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5171.96s)]
*  doing ethnic cleansing campaigns you must want to [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5180.52s)]
*  Evaporate all jews from existence. You have to be an actual psychopath. Is it does jews? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5184.900000000001s)]
*  But by the way here by the way tucker it's a very weird thing [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5191.88s)]
*  The obsession with israel when we're talking about foreign countries hardly an obsession you're not talking about chinese [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5197.4800000000005s)]
*  You're not talking about japanese. You're not talking about the brits. You're not talking about the french the question. What about the jews? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5202.28s)]
*  What about the jews? Like i'm gonna tell you that right now senator. You're asking the question [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5206.76s)]
*  You're asking why are the jews controlling our foreign policy? That's what you just asked hardly [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5211.88s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5217.72s)]

*  He's not normally under different circumstances. He might say that because I do think he's anti-semitic [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5241.96s)]
*  Having said that in this conversation he has not said that at all [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5247.9800000000005s)]
*  He simply said why is apac not registered as a foreign agent if it gets its notes from a foreign state? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5251.58s)]
*  If it is directly aligned with the goals of a foreign state as opposed to any other foreign nation state [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5259.74s)]
*  Why do lobbyists for this foreign state? [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5268.06s)]
*  Why does uh, why does the the why do the lobbies of this foreign state don't have to register as foreign agents? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5271.58s)]

*  That's amazing asking questions about the jews i'm asking questions about the jews I have [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5385.259999999999s)]
*  There's nothing to do with jews or judaism. It has to with a foreign government isn't israel controlling our foreign policy [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5390.86s)]
*  That's not about the jews said i'm asking by the way [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5395.74s)]
*  You're the one that just called me I think a sleazy feline [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5398.219999999999s)]

*  I just said when I'm asking you're asking you answer it give me another reason if you're not an anti-semite [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5405.74s)]
*  Give me another reason why the obsession is israel [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5410.62s)]
*  I am in no sense obsessed with israel. We are on the brink of war with iran [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5413.900000000001s)]
*  And so these are valid questions, but you're not asking about if I can finish you [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5417.820000000001s)]

*  Which is to defend israel. Yes, and i'm the one who's [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5432.46s)]

*  Distillation of all things wrong with america. It's such a perfect counter to everything [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5440.84s)]
*  That's it. It's like all of these right-wing guys who will be like I hate woke culture [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5448.3s)]
*  They turn into a hysterical shaw the moment that they have to defend israel. They they'll say oh, I hate foreign governments [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5453.58s)]
*  Uh controlling or trying to control america. They immediately are like well, no is israel's different israel's different [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5461.1s)]

*  it's such a perfect example because [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5473.66s)]
*  It plays it's in this weird space where it is both america and not america at the same time [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5477.18s)]
*  But ironically enough [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5484.22s)]
*  even if israel was [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5486.62s)]
*  Legally considered [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5489.88s)]

*  Obsessed with israel. I don't see a lawmaker's job as defending the interests of a foreign government period any government including the ones that my [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5551.5s)]

*  That does not make me an anti-semite and shame on you for suggesting otherwise and I mean that and that's low [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5559.660000000001s)]
*  And you know, it's low. So why don't you just answer my question? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5564.9400000000005s)]

*  Shame on you is cute. By the way, tucker it is. It's not cute. I'm offended [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5571.26s)]

*  It is sleazy to imply that i'm an anti-semite for asking questions about how my government [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5580.38s)]
*  Is you want to count how many questions you asked about what about the jews? What about israel? What about a pack? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5585.18s)]
*  Asked about the jesus. Yeah, that's the other side [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5588.860000000001s)]
*  He ain't never like under different circumstances. Maybe tucker does occasions [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5592.22s)]
*  He's too smart of a propagandist to like reveal his his true position. This is one of the things that he's always done very well [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5596.3s)]
*  Okay [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5604.06s)]
*  That's why I used to consider him one of the most dangerous threats to [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5605.1s)]
*  American future [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5609.74s)]

*  He is a pro [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5615.82s)]
*  at taking white nationalist anti-semetic [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5618.139999999999s)]
*  anti-black anti-brown narratives and [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5622.44s)]

*  He didn't say jews at all [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5634.3s)]
*  He didn't say that at all [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5636.9400000000005s)]
*  Do I do I think he's anti-semetic probably I mean he does he did do a healthy dose of the great replacement theory [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5638.3s)]
*  And the the hidden underlying premise of the great replacement is that there's a shadowy group of people that are doing that [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5646.14s)]
*  Okay, and that shadowy group of people of course are [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5653.820000000001s)]
*  the jews [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5657.58s)]
*  right, so there is um [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5658.9400000000005s)]
*  there is a reason to to [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5661.74s)]
*  Assume that he is most likely anti-semetic, but he's not he's not doing that right now. He's not doing that at all [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5664.54s)]
*  He's not saying anything that is even remotely anti-semetic jews [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5671.82s)]
*  I I have this has nothing to do with the jews whatever that means [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5675.82s)]
*  This has to do with a foreign government and once again shame on you for conflating the two [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5679.98s)]
*  They have nothing to do with each other. I'm talking about the influence. The israel and jews have nothing to do with each other [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5685.98s)]
*  All jews are an attack on all jews, which I am not nor would I ever [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5690.62s)]
*  Be undertaking now. I'm not attacking anybody by the way [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5696.459999999999s)]
*  That's who iran wants to kill is all the jews and all the americans and i'm totally opposed to that [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5699.179999999999s)]
*  Okay, but now because except you don't want to do anything about decisions need to be made [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5704.219999999999s)]
*  We can talk about those decisions and I plan to good [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5709.099999999999s)]
*  But I just want to get a sense of whether you think having described yourself as an america first person who's only [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5711.419999999999s)]
*  Criterion for judgment on foreign policies america's national interest to what extent you're influenced by a foreign government [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5717.58s)]
*  Which gives you a lot of money through its lobby and you're claiming this has nothing to do with the foreign government [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5722.780000000001s)]
*  They're not coordinating. Yes, you're spying on us, but doesn't bother you [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5726.700000000001s)]
*  And i'm sort of wondering like what is this? This is the one of the weirdest conversations i've ever had [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5729.740000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you what and i'll answer any question you like but let's try it ultimately comes down to why does israel have this special status? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5733.58s)]
*  and the honest answer for that is because [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5741.740000000001s)]
*  It is immensely important to america's foreign policy goals in the region [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5745.1s)]
*  Now, of course, that's the steel man position, but that's also the reality [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5751.9s)]
*  Okay [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5756.14s)]
*  That is the reality and uh, even then though, it's still [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5757.42s)]
*  Indefensible how much israel gets away with [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5762.12s)]
*  Which is precisely because it's not just about american foreign policy goals. There's also a healthy dose of of [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5765.9s)]
*  zionist ideology [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5772.84s)]
*  that american politicians and american christians american jews [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5775.1s)]
*  That that agree with this like there is a there is not only a material reason for it [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5780.62s)]
*  But there's also definitely like an ideological predisposition towards defending israel due to tremendous tremendous propaganda [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5786.38s)]
*  Because it is a very sophisticated network of of influence [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5795.66s)]
*  And that is precisely the reason why then you turn around and you say, okay [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5800.62s)]
*  why don't you uh, you know, why is this allowed you can always point to [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5804.94s)]
*  you can always point to to other allied states and and ask like if [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5810.139999999999s)]
*  I don't know if england did half the shit [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5816.0599999999995s)]
*  That israel did we would punish them if england did half the shit that israel did back to america [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5819.099999999999s)]
*  We would punish them like outward open [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5825.98s)]

*  Who is asking these questions? [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5883.34s)]

*  Media with fox news to come out this way try are you going to call me an anti-semit again or no? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5893.9800000000005s)]

*  It's actually a fun comedy about politics and eddie murphy in the movie is a con man [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5919.1s)]
*  Who gets elected to congress and he's literally a con man who? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5924.38s)]
*  The congressman dies. He has the same name and so he runs and they get elected and there's a there's a scene in the movie [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5928.14s)]
*  Where where eddie murphy is a freshman member of congress and he's sitting down with a sleazy lobbyist [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5932.78s)]
*  And uh, he's asking the lobbyist all right, what should my positions be on? I think they were talking about power plants and and [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5937.9800000000005s)]
*  uh electrical transmission lines [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5944.780000000001s)]
*  And and the lobbyist like well, what do you believe? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5947.34s)]
*  And eddie murphy's comments that I don't care whatever gets me the most money [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5950.46s)]
*  I'll do whatever gets me the most money and the lobbyist says no no [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5953.5s)]
*  Pick a side doesn't matter what you pick if you pick one side [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5956.700000000001s)]

*  We'll just anti israel lobby in this equation. Why is it that every side is pro israel? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5964.14s)]
*  Why is it that there is no? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5970.38s)]

*  the the famously powerful care [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5978.46s)]
*  Which I think is like on the verge of being classified as a terrorist group. That's that's great virtually [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5981.42s)]
*  Like I would say 99% of republicans and like 75% of democrats consider care to be a terrorist group [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5989.26s)]
*  Like a hostile entity inside of american borders [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5995.9800000000005s)]
*  What kind of legislation has care actually funded? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=5999.5s)]
*  Shake down that that's a little bit the way it works and and you often get get [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6002.54s)]
*  Leftists in the media who say for example, if you support the second amendment as you do and [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6008.3s)]
*  Care is the council for american islamic relations. It's basically like a anti-hate group [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6013.02s)]
*  Like a anti islamophobia group basically j street [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6019.74s)]
*  That's funny also funny. So you so you're telling me that the only opposition to apac is yet another [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6024.62s)]
*  zionist lobby for israel [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6031.64s)]
*  a liberal one, but still a zionist lobby for israel. Well [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6034.22s)]
*  Very diverse range of options here for the anti israel [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6038.9400000000005s)]
*  lobby [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6043.26s)]
*  Seemingly and I do well you're just bought bought and paid for by the nra and that actually is backwards [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6044.200000000001s)]
*  I believe in the second amendment because I believe in the constitution [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6049.580000000001s)]
*  Now am I proud that the nra supports me sure because people who care about the second amendment want to support leaders who fight for it [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6052.3s)]
*  But it gets it backward. Look apac when I ran for the senate apac didn't support me [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6058.38s)]
*  I supported israel before they supported me. I'm happy to have their support because they share my objective [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6062.86s)]
*  No, but you're missing it. I'm not suggesting that you're bought and paid for i'm not saying that [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6068.62s)]
*  I actually want to go back and take sincere [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6071.82s)]

*  Bernie and I sat down and talked for approximately what 10 minutes or [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6269.900000000001s)]

*  also [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6284.639999999999s)]
*  bernie sanders [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6285.679999999999s)]
*  When matched up with the rest of us congress is infinitely closer to my position as opposed to [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6287.44s)]
*  Tucker carlson's position in this situation is [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6294.08s)]
*  You know [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6297.44s)]
*  Like tuggar carlson and bernie sanders would sit down and tuggar carlson would not rip bernie sanders the shreds on his position on israel [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6298.5599999999995s)]
*  Tucker carlson is talking to one of the most pro israel politicians in the country. That's funny. Wait, come on, man [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6306.24s)]
*  That's just lie. You literally great because our stream multiple times and you have not once ripped them on his awful takes [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6312.799999999999s)]
*  Wait, hold on fun. Someone said rocana as well, which I did [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6316.719999999999s)]
*  I did once again not a hour long back and forth conversation. I told rocana that israel was doing a genocide a year ago [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6319.839999999999s)]
*  At dnc I asked him why no democrat is also openly saying that israel's doing a genocide [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6328.5599999999995s)]
*  That we are participating in at dnc [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6335.679999999999s)]
*  For asking questions and it's also the only government that no one will ever criticize [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6339.04s)]
*  And I find that israel every minute also. Yeah when I had a conversation with greg kizar, I [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6343.36s)]
*  Asked him why he didn't endorse zoram memdani and instead endorsed brad lander every day [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6348.24s)]
*  Like the only government that people will not criticize rashida talleed just tweeted out calling benjamin netanyahu a war criminal [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6353.2s)]
*  Um, rashida talleed, but no, you said no one will criticize [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6361.04s)]
*  I'm talking about republicans that I would vote for including you [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6365.12s)]
*  And i'm saying, you know, whatever. I I don't even like talking about israel what I care about [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6368.5599999999995s)]
*  I never do because it's not worth being called [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6374.719999999999s)]
*  antisemites from [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6377.34s)]
*  apac recipients [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6378.719999999999s)]
*  But yeah a better comparison to this would be you pressuring dems on immigration something the party was for you asked every democratic [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6380.48s)]
*  congressperson you had about immigration from rocana to rashida to leave exactly [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6385.84s)]
*  Every single one including ones who were in agreement with me and said the democratic party wasn't doing enough like aoc and rashida talleed [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6390.160000000001s)]
*  And also ones like rocana as well, but now it's not I don't even like talking about israel what I care about [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6397.4400000000005s)]
*  I never do because it's not worth being called [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6404.88s)]
*  antisemites from [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6407.58s)]
*  apac recipients [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6408.88s)]
*  But now we are on the verge of joining a war [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6410.72s)]
*  and [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6414.320000000001s)]
*  I just want to be clear about why we're doing this. All right, so [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6415.52s)]
*  and let's get into iran momentarily, but but [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6419.200000000001s)]
*  You suggested it was a strange thing that I said a minute ago that when I came in it was not very ego [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6423.4400000000005s)]
*  They were talking about the mainstream left media. No, i'm responding to someone else [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6428.320000000001s)]
*  Um, i'm responding to other people who said you've all you've you've interviewed [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6433.04s)]
*  uh democratic congresspersons [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6437.52s)]
*  And you didn't actually call them the task [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6440.240000000001s)]
*  The first person also said leftist [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6444.0s)]
*  And I thought they were being disingenuous because I didn't think that they meant msnbc when they meant leftist media [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6446.48s)]
*  The senate I resolved that I was going to be the leading defender of israel and what you didn't ask is why so let me tell [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6454.0s)]
*  You why no you said I was obsessed with israel and you had just told me that like your driving [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6458.56s)]
*  Motive to get to the senate was to defend israel. I'm like, I don't think I'm the one who's [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6463.6s)]
*  Tucker words matter. Uh-huh [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6469.92s)]
*  The and you know that [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6472.24s)]
*  I said I resolved to be the leading defender of israel and you said your driving motive the reason you're in the senate [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6475.04s)]
*  You want to be the leading defender of israel? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6479.92s)]
*  I would think if I ran for senate i'd be like there are people dying of drug addis on the street [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6481.6s)]
*  My driving motive is to fight for texas and america and to fight for jobs and to fight for the constitution [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6485.6s)]
*  And and you played a very very careful word game of a lie to you the one who said it not me [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6491.6s)]
*  So you still haven't asked why but i'm going to tell you why [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6497.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, and the reason is twofold number one is a christian [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6500.96s)]
*  Growing up in sunday school. I was taught from the bible [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6505.6s)]
*  Those who bless israel will be blessed and those who curse israel will be cursed [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6508.88s)]
*  And from my perspective, I want to be on the blessing side of things of the those who bless the government of israel [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6513.76s)]
*  Those who bless israel is what it says doesn't say the government of it says the nation of israel [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6519.12s)]
*  So that's in the bible as a christian. I believe he had to hit the bible, dude [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6523.2s)]
*  Someone had a really funny responses on twitter is like if I name my son jesus will you have to worship him? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6528.16s)]
*  Like he's the son of god unless you be damned to hell [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6534.64s)]
*  like [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6538.96s)]
*  You don't understand. It's in the bible tucker. I'll have you know [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6540.32s)]
*  The bible, okay. That's my answer as an answered believe that where is that? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6544.16s)]
*  I can find it to you. I don't have the the the scripture off the tip of mine [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6549.28s)]
*  You pull out the phone and use the json genesis, but so you're quoting a a bible phrase you don't have damn [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6552.719999999999s)]
*  He's cooking him even with the bible stuff [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6561.12s)]
*  God damn tucker carlson taking the atheist debate lord position of knowing more about the bible [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6564.32s)]
*  Than the opposition that's just simply bringing up the bible as a talking point [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6570.32s)]
*  Classic take he's not a atheist obviously [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6577.28s)]
*  But i'm just saying it's like that's a there's a classic atheist move [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6580.16s)]
*  Context for it. You don't know where in the bible it is, but that's like your theotheology. It's bible maxing theology. I'm confused [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6584.64s)]
*  What does that even mean tucker? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6590.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm a christian. I want to know what you're talking about [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6593.2s)]
*  Where does where does my support for israel come from number one? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6596.32s)]
*  Because biblically we're commanded to support israel, but number two [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6600.4s)]
*  Hold on you're a senator and now you're throwing out theology and I am a christian I am allowed to weigh in on this [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6605.44s)]

*  Genesis that's what god is talking about the nation of israel. Yes [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6629.42s)]
*  And he's so is that the current borders the current leadership? [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6632.64s)]
*  He's talking about the political entity called israel. He's talking about the nation of israel [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6635.2s)]

*  1963 [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6914.0s)]
*  in both passages the bible says [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6916.18s)]
*  America must do a first strike on iran alongside the modern israeli nation state on the fordow [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6918.98s)]

*  I didn't make it up. It's in the bible [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6931.7s)]
*  It says in the fine print is crazy. The bible has it all people forget [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6934.26s)]
*  People forget these important passages [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6940.5s)]
*  That is for me a personal motivation, but I also what I was about to say [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6943.94s)]
*  I don't believe my personal faith not everyone who I represent as a christian [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6948.5s)]
*  It's not an argument for me to give that that we should do this because of my faith [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6953.38s)]
*  And so as as an elected official, I don't give that as the reason we should support israel [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6957.54s)]
*  That is a personal motivation for me [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6961.94s)]
*  But but I don't think it is the reason we should the reason [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6964.26s)]
*  That I am the leading defender of israel is because israel is our strongest ally in the middle east an incredibly troubled part of the world [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6967.7s)]
*  And supporting israel benefits america and the clearest illustration of that is what is happening right now [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6973.78s)]
*  Can you let me just make this point and then okay, and then i'll just ask what you mean. That's it. Yeah, look [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6980.98s)]
*  Iran I think the most acute national security threat facing america right now [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6987.22s)]
*  Is the threat of a nuclear iran? I think china is the biggest long-term threat but acute and near-term [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6993.46s)]
*  Is a nuclear do we think that ted is smart enough to actually compare the differences between the biblical israel and the decision to name the [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=6999.64s)]

*  Or is he just incredibly dumb? I think it's it he doesn't know that [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7010.6s)]
*  Like I think I think if you were to add like a lot of these guys don't give a shit obviously [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7016.04s)]

*  The return of the jewish people from exile the statehood within the land of israel is exactly the biblical prophecy of ezekiel aziah [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7292.639999999999s)]
*  And jeremiah and actualizes god's covenants with abraham isaac and jacob [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7298.32s)]
*  You don't need to believe any of this [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7303.04s)]
*  But if you are a self-proclaimed christian professing allegiances, but denying these principles, I don't understand your theology. Yeah, not the same language [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7304.32s)]

*  Yeah, there are jews who moved to palestine before balfour or even modern zionism [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7334.400000000001s)]

*  Or anyone moving there for personal religious or whatever purpose [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7338.96s)]
*  The problem is when a genocidal apartheid state is created to exclude and displace rather than exist within the local population [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7342.08s)]
*  But israel writers act like hating the latter means you hate the former. Yeah the idea that like [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7347.360000000001s)]
*  jews actually came [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7352.56s)]

*  deliberately crafted by a colonial entity that was in charge [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7359.6s)]
*  As as a as palestine british mandate palestine was its bounty after world war one [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7365.52s)]
*  for defeating the the ottomans as though this wasn't a deliberate attempt to displace the existing population and then [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7371.76s)]
*  Continue its domination do ethnic cleansing planned ethnic cleansing in an effort to develop a nation state like all of this [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7379.92s)]
*  Is completely unjustifiable. It wasn't like people were just like oh, yeah, I want to move here. This seems great [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7386.96s)]
*  And then people were like no you that's not how this works. That's not the function [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7391.68s)]
*  If that was the case, there wouldn't be a nation state called israel right now [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7396.400000000001s)]
*  It'd be still called palestine a diverse [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7400.0s)]
*  most likely secular [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7403.68s)]

*  And that'd be fantastic. I am in favor of that. Of course, obviously [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7412.96s)]
*  The reason for that is those did not pose a threat to the united states. I think iran is markedly different number one the ayatollah [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7417.28s)]

*  Of course, i'm going to unconditionally [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7447.04s)]

*  And and and I think very serious military by the way, this is a sidebar [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7675.24s)]
*  But I just can't resist the prime minister of israel said that iran tried to assassinate donald trump twice [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7678.6s)]
*  Yeah, I read your newsletter this morning and and but do you believe that's true again? I think it was sort of a word game [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7684.68s)]
*  What is true is iran is trying to assassinate donald j trump and they have hired hitmen now you pointed out [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7691.5599999999995s)]
*  No, he said that they tried to have tried twice to kill him and I I don't know that I don't have any evidence [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7696.44s)]
*  That's true, but I sort of wonder if that is true. Why aren't we aware of them already? Okay? [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7702.44s)]
*  and I read your newsletter this morning and I thought it was [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7706.759999999999s)]
*  It was playing word games to to draw a political point. How's that a word game? It's my president and can I tell you? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7710.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, please. Okay, you rightly pointed out. There's no evidence that the ryan ruth agent of iran [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7717.24s)]
*  And whatever the ugly dude's name was I forgot I can't believe I forgot and he actually did strike trump [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7724.52s)]
*  What was it thomas crooks thomas matthew crooks the irgc's most loyal servant this [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7730.4400000000005s)]
*  Clown in butler pennsylvania who shot the president was working for the iranians. I don't think he was there's no evidence of that [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7737.72s)]
*  Although I would like to know more about I agree was and what's going on [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7743.8s)]
*  But I don't find it plausible that he was working for the iranians [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7747.56s)]
*  so [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7750.6s)]
*  Was that caused by the iranians? [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7751.72s)]
*  No [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7753.8s)]
*  But what is true and what your newsletter didn't acknowledge is it true or false that iran is currently trying to murder donald j trump? [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7754.68s)]
*  And has paid hitmen to do so [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7760.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, that's that's the question and I don't know the butler pennsylvania thing [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7762.92s)]
*  But let's just put that aside. I don't know so so natanyahu misspoke when he said those two assassinations were because of iran [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7766.76s)]
*  But what he was saying that is right is they're actively trying to murder donald j trump. Is there okay? [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7773.56s)]
*  So you're aware of a plot to kill trump. Yes, that iran is paying for and by the way when when [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7779.0s)]
*  Uh, it has been over the last i'd say 18 months to two years in the united states in the united states [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7785.24s)]
*  Yes, they they and and let me put out has anyone been arrested [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7790.84s)]
*  uh [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7794.28s)]
*  For the trump attempted assassination. No [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7795.32s)]
*  But they are also actively paying iranian hitmen to murder mike Pompeo when he was president trump's first secretary of state the first term rather [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7798.6s)]
*  Uh john bolton when john bolton was national security advisor to president trump [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7807.0s)]
*  Uh, and a guy named brian hook who was assistant secretary of state, right during the biden [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7811.08s)]
*  Hold on. Could we go back to donald trump because he's the what do you mean there? [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7815.799999999999s)]
*  When no one has been arrested for these assassination attempts on trump, uh [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7819.24s)]
*  Yes, they've hired hitmen. How do we know that? [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7824.28s)]
*  uh [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7827.08s)]
*  All right. Let me let me break it down people have been arrested [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7828.12s)]
*  So the reason I brought up Pompeo boltman hook who are [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7830.92s)]
*  Under active assassination attempts because of their service of the first trump administration [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7835.4800000000005s)]
*  Under the biden they say that i've never seen any evidence of it. Can I give you the evidence? [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7840.52s)]
*  Well, let's just stick with trump. No, no, no because these are interrelated. So let me make a bloody point [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7844.76s)]
*  Under the biden administration the state department was spending two million dollars a month providing security [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7850.84s)]
*  For pompeo bolton and hook and they did arrest iranian hitmen [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7857.400000000001s)]
*  Okay at john bolton's apartment complex who rented I think the apartment next to him and were actively trying to assassinate him [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7862.38s)]
*  And they went and arrested them. So yes, they caught iranian hitmen now. It so happens iran's not very good at it [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7869.18s)]
*  Uh, and so they but they are actively trying and in fact during the biden trump [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7875.900000000001s)]
*  He's the president if there's a plot to kill trump by the iranians, okay [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7880.22s)]
*  So that's a huge dispute that the iranians are trying to kill trump [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7884.3s)]
*  I of course [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7887.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean that's the most important question the prime minister of israel just said there have been two assassination attempts [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7889.18s)]
*  Against donald trump by the iranians [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7894.780000000001s)]
*  And I think it's a very fair question. Maybe you disagree to ask. What are you talking about? [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7897.18s)]
*  Okay, and and I agree with you that he misspoke so there weren't those two attempts [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7902.06s)]
*  There were two attempts but the the clown in butler pennsylvania and the other guy on the golf course were not connected to the iranians [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7907.34s)]
*  That's the part that that he misspoke but by the way, oh he just misspoke [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7913.820000000001s)]
*  Shit my bad [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7919.66s)]
*  I thought he was lying like he does all the time [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7921.5s)]
*  I guess he misspoke [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7925.740000000001s)]
*  on numerous occasions [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7928.06s)]
*  And he just keeps misspeaking, you know [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7930.54s)]
*  Israel and israeli envoys [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7934.06s)]
*  They misspeak all the time. Have I told you that israel was in the bible and also is the size of new jersey? [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7936.9400000000005s)]
*  Bet you feel stupid now, don't you? Yeah bet you feel dumb now [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7945.34s)]
*  as soon as I told you that this nuclear armed violence state that's conducting a seven front war with unlimited [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7949.42s)]
*  munitions coming from the united states of america is the size of the [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7957.240000000001s)]
*  size of the state of new jersey if you don't immediately [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7962.46s)]
*  Redirect your line of questioning. I will call you an anti-semite. Okay, come on. It was a misspoken assassination accusation [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7966.52s)]
*  Oh shit. Yeah [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7973.34s)]
*  The way when you speak all the time [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7975.42s)]
*  Occasionally what he said that was accurate is that iran is actively trying to murder donald j trump and his paid hitman [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7977.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay, but right, okay, that's fine [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7983.82s)]
*  He was complaining it with the with the two attempts. I understand [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7985.82s)]
*  But I just want to pull that thread because it's so important. I voted for donald trump. I campaigned for donald trump [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7989.34s)]
*  He's our president [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7993.82s)]
*  And we're on the cusp of a war [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7995.18s)]
*  So if iran if there's evidence that iran paid hitmen to kill donald trump and is currently doing that [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=7996.38s)]
*  Where is that? Like what are you even talking? I've never heard that before [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8002.46s)]
*  Okay, where is the evidence? Who are these people? Why haven't they been arrested? Why are we not at war with iran? [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8005.66s)]
*  That's a great question to ask. How do you know that that's true? [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8010.14s)]
*  We know that it's true because we have been told that by [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8014.78s)]
*  The military and our intelligence community for the last two years [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8018.9400000000005s)]
*  We meaning who congress has in the public. I mean it had multiple testimonies I can send you [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8023.5s)]
*  Uh testimony, you know the names of the people are where this happened or what they tried to do to kill trump [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8028.54s)]
*  We do not we have not apprehended an iranian hitman trying to kill him [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8033.74s)]
*  We know that iran is trying to do so in the united states [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8037.9s)]
*  Yes, and and by the way like iran this just seems like a huge headline and you're acting like everyone knows this [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8042.139999999999s)]
*  I didn't know that iran put out a whole video about murdering trump [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8047.259999999999s)]
*  Right, but i've never heard evidence that there are hitmen in the united states [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8052.86s)]
*  I mean trying to kill trump right now [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8057.099999999999s)]
*  We should like have a nationwide drag net on this and we should attack iran immediately if that's true [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8058.94s)]
*  Don't you think no? [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8064.86s)]
*  Uh, but they're trying to assassinate our president. They have been for two years. They are our enemies with them [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8066.86s)]
*  Well, we are trying to why don't we just nuke tehran if they're trying to murder our president [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8072.78s)]
*  There's nothing that you could do that would be worse for the united states than murdering trump [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8076.86s)]
*  And I just don't understand why you're not calling for the use of nuclear weapons against the ayatollah right now [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8081.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm serious if they're if you really believe they're trying to murder the use of nuclear the problem of so you mean [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8085.34s)]
*  You don't seem to take the allegation seriously. I do if you believe they're trying to murder trump [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8089.900000000001s)]
*  We need to stop what we're doing [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8093.74s)]
*  And punish them. Can I ask something and I mean this sincerely so [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8095.58s)]
*  All right [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8101.02s)]
*  20 years ago [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8101.900000000001s)]
*  That's crazy is a freak off is a hawk off [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8103.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean he's he's baiting him to be fair. He's he's trying to [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8108.14s)]
*  Show that ted cruise is not sincere [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8112.46s)]
*  um in this situation, but of course he gets to entertain these hypotheticals because I don't think he would give a shit if we [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8115.900000000001s)]
*  nuked tehran [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8122.7s)]
*  Tucker carlson, I mean because he has in the past advocated for that but he's calling ted cruises bluff [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8125.1s)]
*  You were [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8132.7s)]
*  I think it's fair to say in the interventionist world you were a voting time [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8134.46s)]
*  You were a vocal defender of the iraq war. I was a promoter of the iraq war [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8138.78s)]
*  and [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8143.26s)]
*  You now and I [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8145.26s)]
*  Just look I think you think you were mistaken. I think you were mistaken [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8147.58s)]
*  That's okay. Look people change and learn and that's that's part of the journey of being human [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8150.3s)]
*  Your views have moved though in my view [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8154.06s)]
*  Gross, by the way, he said no i've promoted it [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8157.9800000000005s)]
*  They've gone way too far the other end and and so i'm totally confused. I'm saying hold on [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8161.820000000001s)]
*  This is one of the weirdest covers to direct [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8167.58s)]
*  I'm saying if it's true that iran is trying to murder trump. We need to move militarily against iran immediately [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8169.66s)]
*  That's not isolationism [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8174.62s)]
*  That's the most that's a cult of violence, which I am calling for if we believe that iran is trying to murder our president [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8176.22s)]
*  We need to strike iran. Okay, but I say things like well then just nuke them, which is what you just said [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8182.54s)]
*  Which is kind of a weird because i'm upset because i'm taking you seriously you don't take your own statements [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8186.86s)]
*  I take my statements very seriously [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8192.78s)]
*  So i've asked you where's the evidence this is true and you said well [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8194.14s)]
*  They're trying to assassinate brian hook or something which i'm against by the way [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8196.7s)]
*  I'm against hurting any american period no matter so you dispute that they're trying to murder i'm not disputing it at all [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8200.3s)]
*  I'm not disputing. They're literally arrested the hitman with bolt. I'm not I don't know why [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8205.42s)]
*  That's even relevant. I'm asking about the president of the united states [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8209.34s)]
*  Wait, it's not relevant that iran hired hitmen to murder cabinet members in trump's administration. That doesn't go to [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8211.82s)]
*  I've already said that they're willing to spend money to do that. I'm totally opposed to that. It's awful [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8218.46s)]
*  I am against killing anybody actually and especially foreign government. Okay [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8224.779999999999s)]
*  i'm asking about your allegation and the prime minister of israel's allegation that [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8229.74s)]
*  I is that iran is trying to murder the president killing terrorists is a good thing [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8234.300000000001s)]
*  Killing people who are trying to murder americans is a good thing because if you're america first [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8239.18s)]
*  You want to protect america and so taking out killing osama bin laden was a fantastic [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8244.140000000001s)]
*  But you don't really believe that they're trying to murder trump or yes, I do [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8249.26s)]
*  Yes, I do [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8252.460000000001s)]
*  Why aren't you calling for military action against iran right now because they're not very effective in terms of hitmen [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8253.02s)]
*  Their hitmen are not very effective. I do think so they're hitmen, but not the bad kind the efficient kind [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8257.58s)]
*  What are you saying? [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8262.46s)]
*  They're a weak country who is on its knees and I think we need to then why are we so afraid of them? [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8263.66s)]
*  Why are they the biggest threat if they're a weak country that's on its knees because they're trying i'm trying to keep track [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8267.82s)]
*  They're trying to develop [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8271.82s)]
*  I gotta run it back. The pause is so bad [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8278.62s)]
*  He's so mad because they're trying i'm trying to keep track. They're trying to develop [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8281.9s)]
*  This [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8287.5s)]
*  Oh my god, bro one hour of toasting dude, dude [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8291.74s)]
*  I can't this is shameful. This is a shameful experience. It's like eating [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8296.54s)]
*  Uh an oar talon, you know what? I mean, I feel like I need to cover up [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8300.46s)]
*  Because this is an affront to god. I am disrespecting god [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8304.7s)]
*  By deriving this much satisfaction [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8309.02s)]
*  from a white nationalist cia, uh reject [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8311.58s)]
*  Cooking this worm-like individual [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8316.699999999999s)]
*  Is so [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8324.38s)]
*  Is up I haven't had I haven't watched a debate that i've been this satisfied with [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8327.5s)]
*  I haven't been I've yet to watch a debate that was this satisfying [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8336.3s)]
*  in so long [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8342.22s)]
*  Like this is having the exact opposite [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8345.179999999998s)]
*  Of watching a jubilee piece of content from jubilee for me. It's crazy [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8348.699999999999s)]
*  It's been it's been a long ass time since I felt this way watching a debate [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8354.06s)]
*  I think the last time I felt this way was watching, uh, norm finkelstein whip up [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8361.34s)]
*  Mr boner rally [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8367.179999999998s)]
*  Be a little less snarky. I know you're right. That is a problem that I have i'm sorry [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8369.82s)]
*  They're trying to develop nuclear weapons. They are close to developing nuclear weapons and even a weak country with a nuclear weapon [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8374.22s)]
*  Look, I believe there is a very real possibility if the ayatollah develops a nuclear weapon that he would detonate it [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8381.58s)]
*  either in tel aviv or new york or los angeles and that would be [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8389.019999999999s)]
*  Utterly catastrophic and I don't know what the chances are of that [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8393.82s)]
*  Let me compare and contrast iran to north korea [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8398.06s)]
*  Wait, can I just ask one last question about trying to kill the president? [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8401.26s)]
*  You sincerely believe you promise that right now the iranian government is trying to murder our president [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8404.94s)]
*  Yes, and surely right now absolutely and yet you were not calling for military action against the government that's trying to murder our president [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8411.18s)]
*  Can you explain that? [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8416.94s)]
*  uh [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8418.300000000001s)]
*  I don't think they're very effective. I do think we should by the way america is you're willing to take that risk [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8421.900000000001s)]
*  I think we should protect the president and we should take out our enemies. Oh, are they is doing that right now? [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8431.02s)]
*  But aren't they why would we? [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8437.1s)]
*  If they're trying to question was why are you for regime change? That's a pretty good example of why i'm for regime change [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8439.58s)]
*  Okay, so you're saying we should just go in and take out the government of iran [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8445.18s)]
*  Why would we outsource it to israel if they're trying to murder a president? Okay, you sound like the isolationist [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8447.66s)]
*  What i'm saying on any military judgment is there needs to be a cost benefit analysis of what are the risks versus what are the what are the [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8452.86s)]
*  What are the benefits in this instance? [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8460.539999999999s)]
*  I think it is enormously in america's interest to do what israel is doing right now take out iran's senior military leadership and take out [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8463.02s)]
*  their nuclear capacity [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8469.66s)]
*  That is benefiting america and it is it's crazy because these guys believe [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8471.5s)]
*  100 like not 100 obviously 99 percent of the same shit [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8477.96s)]
*  But on this one issue tucker carlson does not agree with him [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8482.78s)]
*  So I guess like maybe this is me coping but like it's two [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8486.22s)]
*  Maximum white nationalists racist [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8490.779999999999s)]
*  Possibly anti-semitic individuals, but one is pro israel and one is anti israel [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8494.699999999999s)]
*  so the anti israel one is the the [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8501.42s)]
*  clear [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8505.32s)]
*  An obvious voice of reason in this situation. I don't believe [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8506.539999999999s)]
*  I do not believe for the record that tucker carlson actually called up trump to apologize [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8511.26s)]
*  Dude is trump threatening to iran to scare putin out of ukraine. He's not anti israel. He's just less pro. No, no, no [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8516.539999999999s)]
*  Tucker carlson's anti israel chatter. I think he's definitely anti israel. I don't think he's [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8524.38s)]
*  I don't think he's pro israel. I'm gonna be honest. There are foreign nations that tucker carlson is in favor of russia [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8530.939999999999s)]
*  For example, he's definitely pro russia. He's not pro israel [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8537.02s)]
*  A good risk reward I would oppose [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8542.38s)]
*  invading iran [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8545.34s)]
*  And putting boots on the ground to topple the government [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8547.42s)]
*  If the risk got severe enough, I would support that but I think the relative risk is not severe enough to justify that step [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8551.26s)]
*  At this time what I would absolutely oppose under any circumstances [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8558.86s)]
*  Is invading iran and then staying and trying to turn them into a democracy and part of where iraq really went off off the rails [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8564.460000000001s)]
*  Is not only did we topple someone who was fighting radical islamic terrorists who's a bad guy [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8572.06s)]
*  But then we tried the vision of interventionist [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8576.62s)]
*  It actually overlaps with the vision of a lot of democrats. Let's go promote democracy in the world [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8580.22s)]
*  And it is our military's job to kill the bad guys to defend america [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8585.02s)]
*  It's not their job to defend international norms. It's not their job [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8589.82s)]
*  So I have zero desire for the u.s military to turn iran into switzerland [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8593.74s)]
*  Look, would it be nice if they suddenly became switzerland? Sure if I could wave a magic wand great [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8598.8s)]
*  But i'm not going to send your kids or my kids to be in front of guns to go make that happen [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8603.52s)]
*  Well, bless you for that. I I think that's a that is the lesson that I learned from iraq. I promoted that war [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8608.4s)]
*  Apparently unlike you. Um, I was dumber [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8614.4s)]
*  And I think that you just articulated the main lesson of it, which is it's hard to do that and we're not good at it [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8617.28s)]
*  But but but I will yes [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8622.8s)]
*  And so we're agreeing on that I will say as a vehemently agreeing as a corollary mean that that [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8624.56s)]
*  Horrible evil dictators are okay [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8631.439999999999s)]
*  And going back to reagan in the cold war we have lots of weapons [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8634.32s)]
*  I am happy to highlight the brutality the oppression the human rights abuses of regimes even though I don't want to invade them [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8638.64s)]
*  Because I think the bully pulpit of american leadership is really powerful and and [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8646.8s)]
*  I think [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8651.92s)]
*  Paterships are terrified. So i've spent [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8653.58s)]
*  13 years in the senate one of the things I do frequently is highlight dissidents in [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8656.94s)]
*  Iran and north korea and china in venezuela people are being tortured. Uh, [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8661.98s)]
*  uh [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8667.58s)]
*  Miriam ibrahim in in sudan who was sentenced [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8668.7s)]
*  to a hundred lashes [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8673.42s)]
*  And then to be killed for the crime of being a christian [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8675.42s)]
*  And I repeatedly went to the senate floor and shined a light on the governor of sudan it was corrupt [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8678.779999999999s)]
*  It was evil. I practically begged barack obama say her name [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8683.58s)]
*  Ultimately, I felt that way with the j6 prisoners. I look yes and and we [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8688.76s)]
*  Look [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8694.539999999999s)]
*  There is power to speaking out and all [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8695.5s)]
*  that's [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8698.699999999999s)]
*  Such an insane insertion. I felt that way about the j6 prisoners is [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8700.06s)]
*  A psychotic thing to add into this conversation. Yeah [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8707.98s)]
*  200 lashes is what all the j6 prisoners were getting it was really tough [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8712.619999999999s)]
*  Ultimately [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8718.6s)]
*  The international obama never did say her name. He would not say her name [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8719.9s)]
*  Ultimately, there was enough international condemnation the government of sudan let her go and so she was not executed [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8723.9s)]
*  And and I actually I I met her [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8730.699999999999s)]
*  So she had a [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8733.58s)]
*  Two-year-old son martin and she gave birth to a little girl named maya [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8734.86s)]
*  And she was in leg irons in prison waiting for the death sentence. They were not going to kill her until she gave birth [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8738.62s)]
*  And they told her we will not kill you [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8744.140000000001s)]
*  If you will renounce jesus and she refused [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8747.42s)]
*  And and I met her she was in dc speaking at a conference after she was released obviously and [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8750.86s)]
*  And I asked she's she's a a tiny woman very small woman. I asked her I said [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8756.140000000001s)]
*  When you were in that prison cell with with your kids [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8760.38s)]
*  How did you have the strength not to just give in to despair? [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8764.939999999999s)]
*  I mean that I you know, i've never been threatened with with murder unless I renounced my faith [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8768.14s)]
*  And she just said to me with with a real [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8774.14s)]
*  Peacefulness. She said jesus was with me [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8776.939999999999s)]
*  and it yeah, I mean it [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8779.5s)]
*  Thankfully you and I have not faced faced that circumstance [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8783.019999999999s)]
*  But I do think there is a responsibility [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8786.779999999999s)]
*  Responsibility there's still time. There is and I hope we don't what planet are these guys on? [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8789.26s)]
*  What the are they taught? Okay, is the rest of this even? [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8797.74s)]
*  Okay, oh there's uh, there's more wait are there iranians as they're trying to kill trump more [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8801.98s)]
*  Okay, can we yeah, can we move away from this stupid ass story? I'm listening [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8806.78s)]
*  like take cruz talking about how like christians are under attack in america and and [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8811.42s)]
*  Alongside tucker carlson is not even remotely in the realm of interest for me. I [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8815.9s)]
*  I'm in there, but okay, man. We're writing that uh [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8821.9s)]
*  When I first got here mccain [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8825.58s)]
*  Hated my guts and and and he actually referred to to me and and rand [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8827.98s)]
*  As wacko birds [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8832.86s)]
*  I remember, um, I have up on the shelf which I can't get so very i'm [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8834.54s)]
*  Next in iran and what should happen next so you've called for regime change. You said you don't favor the u.s [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8839.26s)]
*  military participating in any kind of regime change [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8845.1s)]
*  You said you don't think and bless you for saying this that the u.s military should try and turn it into belgium. Yeah, thank god [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8848.140000000001s)]
*  Um, but there is a third option where it turns into syria [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8854.460000000001s)]
*  Where it's this open wound and it causes massive migration and further destroys europe as syria has yeah [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8857.820000000002s)]
*  um [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8864.86s)]
*  And that's a huge cost and where lots of people die and we'll just minorities get murdered in syria again [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8866.140000000001s)]
*  Are you worried about that? [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8871.34s)]
*  Sure, and and listen that lots of bad things can happen [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8873.26s)]
*  But going back to what we talked about the principle of defending america [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8877.5s)]
*  I agree with president trump [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8882.14s)]
*  that [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8885.1s)]
*  Iran with a nuclear weapon [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8886.86s)]
*  Is an unacceptable risk to america and we need to stop it. I agree with president trump and and i'll make a point [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8889.1s)]
*  But he's not for regime change. He's not so he and I disagree [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8897.66s)]
*  Look, I think he thinks it would be better. He has not said he's for it [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8901.34s)]
*  Um, and you know what? Look it is consequential when the president of the united states says [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8904.94s)]
*  I'm for regime change. So I understand why he hasn't [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8909.58s)]
*  What he has said is he's drawn a red line and said [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8912.62s)]
*  Iran will not have a nuclear weapon and and the only acceptable outcome is complete dismantlement [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8915.82s)]
*  So they have centrifuges. They're they're enriching uranium right now. They're trying to develop a nuclear weapon [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8920.94s)]
*  He said they they must have complete dismantlement. I led 52 senators republican senators [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8925.58s)]
*  In a letter where we said we agree with president trump. That's the red line complete dismantlement [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8931.1s)]
*  I agree with president trump. I agree with him supporting israel taking out iran's military leadership taking out their nuclear capability [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8936.86s)]
*  And i'll point out look if you look the first term [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8944.140000000001s)]
*  I am hard-pressed to think of a single foreign policy decision [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8948.86s)]
*  Donald trump made the first term that I disagree with and and that's not entirely accidental [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8952.06s)]
*  Because I spent a lot of time the first term in the oval office with him [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8956.48s)]
*  And what happened in the first term often is you would have in the administration you had interventionist in the administration you had isolationist [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8960.56s)]
*  And they disagreed they would fight within the administration [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8967.36s)]
*  And often what it would give is an opportunity for me to come in and say hey, there's a middle path here [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8970.8s)]
*  that president trump agreed with [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8976.48s)]
*  frequently [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8979.42s)]
*  And and it's worth noting in the first term. He most assuredly was not an isolationist [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8980.96s)]
*  Look, he took out general sulemani [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8985.2s)]
*  Which I emphatically agree with and in fact I introduced a resolution that we voted on the senate floor [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8987.84s)]
*  Commending him for taking out general sulemani who was the leader of the irgc [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8993.34s)]
*  and who was [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8997.68s)]
*  Responsible for killing over 600 american servicemen and women [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=8999.18s)]
*  Uh when trump came in isis had a caliphate that had grown up under obama [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9003.2s)]
*  That was about the size of the state of indiana [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9008.640000000001s)]
*  And trump came and killed the terrorists took away their caliphate and defeated them [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9011.44s)]
*  And he also took out baghdaddy the head of isis famously [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9015.76s)]
*  I mean those are not the actions of an isolationist, but at the same time, you know what isolationist [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9020.480000000001s)]
*  It's just a slur designed to control. I mean, I've never met an isolationist. I don't even know what that means [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9025.2s)]
*  Okay, rand paul is my colleague rand is an isolationist and tucker you've become one and I don't mean it as a slur [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9029.84s)]
*  you consistently say [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9035.6s)]
*  you have said actually I want to read from your newsletter because [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9037.92s)]
*  If you ask what an isolationist is your newsletter a couple of days ago [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9042.88s)]
*  You wrote [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9049.36s)]
*  Um [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9051.52s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and we're hoping to get back to the negotiating table [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9053.6s)]
*  We will see there are several people in leadership in iran that will not be coming back trump said following the strikes, right? [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9057.84s)]
*  It's worth taking a step back [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9063.84s)]
*  And wondering how any of this helps the united states [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9066.4s)]
*  We can't think of a single way [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9070.96s)]
*  okay [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9074.24s)]
*  That to me. No, that's I can't believe i'm saying this but tucker carlson actually put forth a [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9075.6s)]
*  fairly strong [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9081.68s)]
*  Uh case I suspect that he makes in the rest of this argument, but even judging by like what the uh, what the thing that you just read [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9083.44s)]
*  from your foldable quote [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9091.84s)]
*  That you printed out [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9094.16s)]
*  uh is that [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9096.0s)]
*  Going to war with iran is not in the best interest of america [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9098.4s)]
*  Further destabilization in the region is not in the best interest of america [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9104.0s)]
*  getting your notes from israel [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9109.84s)]
*  and putting israel in the [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9113.04s)]
*  driving in the behind the steering wheel [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9115.82s)]
*  Of our ambitions in the region is not a smart thing to do [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9119.2s)]
*  Especially considering that they already have an incredibly costly ethnic cleansing campaign against the palestinians that is even [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9123.68s)]
*  creating more enmity [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9130.720000000001s)]
*  Towards the united states of america in this region and is going to make it even harder to maintain stability in this region [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9133.92s)]
*  with [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9141.68s)]
*  leadership of [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9143.1s)]
*  With leadership of these countries [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9146.800000000001s)]
*  Uh maintaining some structure of like a like a monarchy or different forms of autocracy [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9149.119999999999s)]
*  Autocracies [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9155.199999999999s)]
*  Uh that will always that will always remain stable eventually [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9156.56s)]
*  This will unfold in uncontrollable acts of violence and potential even regime change america is too short-term focused [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9162.24s)]
*  to think [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9171.84s)]
*  That they can continue death and destruction campaigns in the region in perpetuity [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9173.039999999999s)]
*  And basically destabilize all these places and without considering the potential for blowback [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9178.179999999998s)]
*  Even though it is a country that has experienced blowback [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9184.66s)]
*  In the form of 9 11 pretty sure agreeing with tuggar carlson is the first sign of an apocalypse. I [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9189.46s)]
*  I mean he's [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9194.66s)]
*  I think his his major reason for isolationism [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9196.259999999998s)]
*  I assume is because he doesn't want immigrants to come to the country like that's he's he's taking like an oregonian [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9200.42s)]
*  abolitionist framework [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9206.9s)]
*  like oregon as a state was developed uh to be uh a [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9208.68s)]
*  Anti-slavery state because they didn't want black people to be in the state [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9213.06s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like that [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9216.44s)]
*  It's the it's the old attitude of like not invading mexico when america had the capacity to do so because too many mexicans [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9218.12s)]
*  They don't want to live with all these mexicans. It's it's there there have been [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9224.6s)]
*  in the past [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9229.24s)]
*  that uh that think [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9231.32s)]
*  That uh, you know more war means more refugees more brown people coming here [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9233.64s)]
*  He said syria ruined europe and he doesn't want iran to be syria. Yeah, it's basically like that [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9238.76s)]
*  Is this position let's stop bombing the middle east so they stop coming here [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9244.199999999999s)]
*  uh, yes [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9248.039999999999s)]
*  Ironically enough you can make the same argument about destabilization in latin american countries as well [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9250.039999999999s)]
*  Like literally a big a big component of of migration from latin american countries [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9254.44s)]
*  From latin american countries [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9259.8s)]
*  strawman argument nice [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9261.8s)]
*  Sorry, you're right. I should have said tucker carlson actually is an anti-imperialist after spending his entire career defending every single war that america has [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9263.4s)]
*  waged including against iran that he said [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9271.4s)]
*  Were were as a nation state developed by primitive apes that we need to bomb back to the stone age or maybe he said that about iraq [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9274.599999999999s)]
*  He said similar things about iran too [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9282.119999999999s)]
*  tucker carlson with his cia father and his [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9284.599999999999s)]
*  40-year track record of of advocating for u.s. Empire's interests all of a sudden had a change of heart [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9288.519999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think he had a [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9294.68s)]
*  Complete change of heart where he genuinely now is an anti-imperialist [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9296.439999999999s)]
*  Because he cares about the people that are going to be murdered. I mean he not once [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9300.68s)]
*  mentions the the iranian civilians and the death toll [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9306.119999999999s)]
*  That would be insurmountable impossible to contend with [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9310.76s)]
*  If america were to do a first strike on iran [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9315.4s)]
*  He called iraqi semi-literate primitive monkeys on the bubble of love sponge show. Yeah, he said something similar about iran as well. He said that [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9318.68s)]
*  iran america is the only non-interventionist country on the planet america is the only country on the planet that has no ambition of being a [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9326.68s)]
*  Global hegemon. That's what he said and that we should destroy iran because they want they have ambitions [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9333.720000000001s)]
*  Like that. Here's the thing [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9340.28s)]
*  Either tucker carlson sees the writing on the wall [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9342.2s)]
*  about the popular resentment against the state of israel [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9345.560000000001s)]
*  And wants to get ahead of the wave and is no longer contracted by mainstream media and therefore doesn't have the same career ambitions [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9349.400000000001s)]
*  or [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9357.800000000001s)]
*  He is uh isolationist because he doesn't want the destabilization [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9359.08s)]
*  The the immigration that takes place after the destabilization [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9365.560000000001s)]
*  Is the essence of isolationism and let me just ask you when when the ayatollah chants death to america [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9370.14s)]
*  I believe him. Do you not believe him? [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9376.54s)]
*  Do you think he doesn't mean it when he says death to america? I think he hates america for sure [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9378.78s)]
*  And and i'm opposed to that and do you think he's willing to act on it? [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9382.86s)]
*  It's not just hate america [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9385.74s)]
*  He also is like notice how the difference between me and tucker carlson is if someone were to be like, oh well [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9387.1s)]
*  This person said he hates america. Do you love that? [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9391.18s)]
*  I'd be like I think there's pretty valid reasons for this for anyone over there to hate america [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9393.9s)]
*  You hate iran and iran has done significantly less to america than vice versa [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9399.1s)]
*  It's weirder that you hate iran than the average iranian hating america [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9403.74s)]
*  That's what I would say [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9409.5s)]
*  What the fuck has iran done to you dumbass nothing literally nothing iran [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9411.66s)]
*  Literally held vigils after 9 11 iran has routinely fought against [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9416.38s)]
*  Salafist brigades in the region the brigades that also you know the the militancy that we concocted by the way [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9422.699999999999s)]
*  We did the western superpowers did there was this tuggerkin debate. No, I mean he's not debating tech crews [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9430.14s)]
*  He's asking a couple good questions [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9436.14s)]
*  That isn't a debate chatter if you think this is a debate you are a donkey [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9438.22s)]
*  It's not a debate when the person is so ill-equipped that a couple questions makes them break everything [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9443.66s)]
*  Leading a country so the question is [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9450.22s)]
*  Do you act in a way that makes that more or less likely? [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9452.94s)]
*  And [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9456.94s)]
*  That's a that's a tough call. It's something that you can debate [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9457.98s)]
*  One of the ways you shut down debate is by calling people names like isolationists pretending. They're like pro-nazi or something [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9460.699999999999s)]
*  I do call it a debate. Yes. I know but it's more this is adversarial journalism [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9466.539999999999s)]
*  That's what it is more so than a debate [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9472.699999999999s)]
*  I feel like it's a [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9475.5s)]
*  It can be consumed as a debate [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9477.58s)]
*  But what tucker carlson is doing more so is adversarial journalism [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9480.7s)]
*  Where a couple questions basically breaks down the entire world view of someone like ted cruise [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9486.3s)]
*  Or as you did claiming i'm an anti-semite. All right, that's not a way to get to a solution or have a rational conversation [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9494.06s)]
*  That's what to make people be quiet [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9500.22s)]
*  And I i'm against that. Okay. So if you don't like the label isolationist, how would you [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9502.14s)]
*  Look rand and I serve with rand rand is a friend of mine [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9506.46s)]
*  But rand opposes every military action in every circumstance don't oppose every military this whole thing is infantile [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9509.02s)]
*  And you know that it is it's a way it's a way to call people names and military actions [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9514.46s)]
*  Do you support and disagree with them all and make them be quiet? [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9518.619999999999s)]
*  If you don't like that i'm not trying to have you be quiet. We've been talking an hour and a half [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9522.06s)]
*  I'm asking if you don't like the name isolationist. What would how would you describe it? [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9525.58s)]
*  I would I would describe myself in the same way you falsely described yourself in this conversation falsely [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9529.98s)]
*  Yes, what did I say false? You said that the only [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9534.46s)]
*  Thing that matters in a foreign policy decision is whether it helps the united states [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9538.939999999999s)]
*  I didn't say the only I said the predominant that's what I understood [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9542.22s)]
*  Okay [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9545.099999999999s)]
*  So let me revise what you said and apply it to myself and say the only thing that matters is whether or not it serves [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9545.5s)]
*  The united states and I feel very stung by what happened in iraq if i'm being honest [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9550.779999999999s)]
*  Possibly because unlike you I guess I supported it [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9555.82s)]
*  And I saw us get drawn into it in a way that nobody anticipated and I saw the cost [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9558.619999999999s)]
*  Just about three trillion dollars [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9564.619999999999s)]
*  and the cost on so many levels to the united states was just so profound and I [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9567.339999999998s)]
*  I felt like gosh [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9571.419999999998s)]
*  It reminds me of kaiser vilhelm in 1914 [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9573.419999999998s)]
*  Saying my men will be back by the time the leaves turn and of course that destroyed christian europe [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9577.179999999998s)]
*  So it's like you don't really know where these things are going once the shooting holy [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9582.779999999999s)]
*  Shit what a way to frame that [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9588.38s)]
*  What now [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9592.699999999999s)]
*  um in 1914 saying my men will be back by the time the leaves turn and of course [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9595.74s)]
*  That described destroyed christian europe. So it's he must be pro ottoman too. No, bro. He's such a [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9601.66s)]
*  Psycho-supremacist like world war one destroyed christian europe and led to [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9609.16s)]
*  the further destruction of christian europe because of world war two where countries that are supposed to be unified are [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9615.82s)]
*  War with one another my man is just really loves the habsburgs dues rockhar for the austro-hungarian empire [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9622.539999999999s)]
*  He's saying in the absence of these uh wars [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9627.9s)]
*  That europe would have maintained its like christian supremacist attitude [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9632.46s)]
*  It's like you don't really know where these things are going once the shooting starts [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9636.699999999999s)]
*  That's my only point and calling people names anti-semite isolationists to get them to stop talking [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9639.419999999998s)]
*  Is not the way to serve your country. That's all I'm saying [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9645.419999999998s)]
*  So i'm trying to have a real and serious conversation and look [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9648.3s)]
*  A lot of this has been contentious [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9653.019999999999s)]
*  I I wish it had not because as we started out by saying you and I agree vehemently on 80 percent of the issues [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9654.539999999999s)]
*  Uh, this discussion is focused on on the 20 percent where we're saying that russia's participation in world war one led to the bolshevik revolution [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9660.939999999999s)]
*  Which is just mount of christianity because he thinks the bolsheviks were jewish and also a lot of you know [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9667.099999999999s)]
*  Secular democracies were designed in the aftermath [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9672.859999999999s)]
*  Or all the events that unfolded led to world war two as well basically his preference is christian monarchs [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9677.199999999999s)]
*  Existing would be a better form of europe as opposed to what europe looks like now [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9685.28s)]
*  Where we don't [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9689.92s)]
*  um [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9691.52s)]
*  You know, I I will say look on iraq [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9692.64s)]
*  You look at the 2016 presidential campaign where you had 17 republicans running if you set rand aside [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9695.28s)]
*  Uh, and his views are are on one side [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9701.84s)]
*  There were only two candidates on that stage that opposed the iraq war me and donald trump were the only two everyone else thought [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9704.88s)]
*  The iraq war was a great thing. I think it was a disaster. So you and I agree on that as well [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9710.4s)]
*  In my view you went [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9716.48s)]
*  I think your foreign policy has gone too far [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9718.8s)]
*  So, I mean let me ask you is there is undertaking that you agree with because i've not heard anything military [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9720.72s)]
*  Look, I would say it's really simple. I believe in self-defense. That's why I keep firearms at home [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9727.2s)]
*  I think it's morally justified [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9733.359999999999s)]
*  To defend yourself your family your property your nation and so to the extent that you can deter a threat through violence [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9736.24s)]
*  violence always being the least [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9744.72s)]
*  Appealing choice violence always being if I can finish always being a tragedy [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9747.279999999999s)]
*  I think you can justify the use of violence and self-defense that that's my personal view and that applies to did I miss the part? [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9751.439999999999s)]
*  Did tech crews actually imply that he's anti-irac war did he try to like sneak that in? [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9757.439999999999s)]
*  Is that even the case in 2015? He said of course the iraq war was a mistake [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9763.199999999999s)]
*  Ted Cruz broke his relative silence on iraq on wednesday evening urging the u.s to prepare to evacuate his citizens and warning against any deal with iran [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9768.96s)]
*  wait [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9776.08s)]
*  Ted Cruz we had to be very clear any mission [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9777.279999999999s)]
*  We might undertake in iraq as directed to protecting national security interests of the united states not based upon the ephemeral goal of achieving political reconciliation in baghdad [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9779.84s)]
*  Whatever the history of u.s intervention in iraq our priorities now should be able to protect our people and defend our national security interests [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9787.279999999999s)]
*  Not to try to resolve an intractable religious divide some [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9792.0s)]
*  1500 years in the making this was 11 years ago. Yeah, I know i'm trying to figure out what he has said [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9796.3s)]
*  Earlier than this very moment right here where he said he was anti-irac war [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9802.88s)]
*  Take the quiz no [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=9808.08s)]

*  The only reason why this happened [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10033.460000000001s)]
*  Is because ted cruise thought he was going into a non-hostile territory [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10036.02s)]
*  Exactly where they've hired in the united states. Yes americans. Yeah, he's not in iran [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10040.68s)]
*  So they haven't hired hitman. No, but are they the hitman american? I don't know [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10045.24s)]

*  I'm not i'm not the department of defense. I'm telling you what they have told us. I'm not disputing it [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10053.320000000002s)]
*  I'm merely saying we are that i'm not i'm saying the logic train has a massive hole in it [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10057.24s)]
*  If you believe that's true [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10061.880000000001s)]
*  Then you should by definition support killing the people trying to kill our president, but you don't support that now tucker [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10063.960000000001s)]
*  So i'm wondering what's going on here tucker you took offense to the word isolationist and I I genuinely don't mean it as a pejorative [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10069.56s)]
*  I disagree with it [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10075.16s)]
*  But if you don't like that term, I don't know how else to describe [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10077.0s)]
*  What is a coherent foreign policy that says I believe we're surrounded by two giant nations [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10080.6s)]
*  By the way isolationism has long been a a school of foreign policy defense [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10085.64s)]
*  I i'm not okay, but but not into the slurs the anti-semite stuff. I I just don't like that [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10089.72s)]
*  I'm telling you what I believe so but is there a single military action trump took that you agree with so [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10094.519999999999s)]
*  Do you agree with taking out general solomani? [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10099.08s)]
*  So you're right, by the way calling calling isolationism is a slur is so right [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10101.8s)]
*  It's like saying oh man tanky is a slur [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10107.16s)]
*  If anyone were to pull that shit in my chat, I would laugh at them [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10111.0s)]

*  It's a it's a pejorative [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10119.32s)]
*  It's a way to deflect from the points that you're making [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10121.4s)]
*  by signaling [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10124.68s)]
*  All of the things that uh your opposition is making up about you that you supposedly believe [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10126.44s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. It turned out better than I thought I guess you said at the time [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10131.480000000001s)]

*  No way [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10154.519999999999s)]

*  He lost his base of support current isis leadership. You don't think [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10272.68s)]

*  I mean i've taken so many different positions over the years some of which have been wrong [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10327.0s)]
*  I really do my best to be honest and correct if they are and admit that I was wrong [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10330.199999999999s)]
*  I'm not one of these people who's like i've always been consistent. No, my views change all the time because the facts change all the time [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10333.64s)]
*  You're not going to get consistency from me. You're only going to get sincerity [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10338.039999999999s)]
*  Well, I look I will say this and look I believe you're sincere. I yeah, but [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10340.76s)]
*  I'm not god. I'm just some guy watching trying to figure out the right thing for america and I think [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10345.64s)]
*  because [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10350.44s)]
*  You believe you were mistaken and I agree previously. I think you've overcorrected [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10351.72s)]
*  Overcorrected i'm worried about turning [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10356.36s)]
*  This mess in iran into a much larger mess. That's the concern and that's a reasonable worry [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10359.08s)]
*  I know it's reasonable. It was funny when he said facts change over time for the record [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10365.16s)]
*  No, they didn't [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10369.96s)]
*  Facts didn't change [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10371.48s)]
*  Your [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10373.88s)]
*  Your career ambitions did [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10375.4s)]
*  I get why so many people watch talk around fox. Yes. He is an incredibly [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10377.96s)]
*  Incredibly successful propaganda. I used to rip my hair out every night. He speaks at a frequency [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10383.06s)]
*  Where an attitude? [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10390.039999999999s)]
*  Where he can he can so perfectly craft a narrative with plausible deniability [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10392.279999999999s)]
*  that that is [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10399.08s)]
*  inherently [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10401.14s)]
*  white supremacists incredibly white supremacists, but with like [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10402.36s)]
*  just the right [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10407.32s)]
*  tweaking of the words [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10409.16s)]
*  I used to do compilations of like tucker carlson side by side with like jared taylor and all these other like white prominent white nationalists [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10411.400000000001s)]
*  and [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10420.12s)]
*  And he he just channels [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10421.720000000001s)]
*  Their worldview so perfectly in a way that is palatable. It's [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10424.76s)]
*  Terrifying and he was he was endlessly successful [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10428.820000000002s)]
*  Reasonable, and I know you've been like you're like ready to call me all these names for asking [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10432.76s)]
*  So is what he's saying here true since you're not saying anything about it. Yes [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10437.18s)]
*  he is [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10440.7s)]
*  he is [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10442.140000000001s)]
*  The way I described it is like it's two racist white nationalists arguing with one another [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10443.74s)]
*  Uh, they're both christian fascists as well [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10449.1s)]
*  But one is anti-israel and one is pro-israel [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10451.980000000001s)]
*  And the anti-israel position is the correct one here so tucker carlson is [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10454.8s)]
*  Arguing not on the same boundaries that I would argue because like I would talk about the human toll civilian casualties [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10462.24s)]
*  He doesn't care about that [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10468.88s)]
*  but because the situation with israel is so [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10471.039999999999s)]
*  Untenable, it's so indefensible [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10474.8s)]
*  That he can argue even from like this weird concocted [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10477.92s)]
*  Isolation is white nationalist perspective and still come across as the correct position [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10482.98s)]
*  Asking questions. Yes, I am. So here's my question to you [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10489.14s)]
*  If the ayatollah is killed in iran and he very yeah very well good if there's a war [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10492.18s)]
*  I have just read in the paper this morning that [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10496.82s)]
*  Israel tried to take him out twice and trump told them not to [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10499.779999999999s)]
*  I have would you consider tucker in isolation? Not even he's just [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10503.46s)]
*  I don't even think he is. Um, i'm sure there these guys are never actually like [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10507.859999999999s)]
*  Anti-war right? I would never say that they're anti-war. For example, I wouldn't even say he's isolationist because [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10512.5s)]
*  most of these guys [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10519.939999999999s)]
*  Will do this indecent thing [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10522.18s)]
*  Like marjorie taylor green does this where they'll say this is not a war worth waging [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10525.619999999999s)]
*  right [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10532.42s)]
*  If your left is if your left is you believe [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10533.699999999999s)]
*  No war, but class war [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10537.06s)]
*  If you're anti-war if you're anti-imperialism, that's what you believe [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10539.46s)]
*  Okay [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10542.9s)]
*  These guys will say this is not a war that is worthwhile. The hidden implication there is that there are wars [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10544.34s)]
*  oftentimes imperial ambitions [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10552.42s)]
*  Imperial conquest that is worthwhile [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10554.74s)]
*  So marjorie taylor green, for example will say why are we doing all this in the middle east? [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10557.3s)]
*  Well, why are we giving so much money to ukraine? We should stop funding ukraine [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10562.26s)]
*  Why? [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10567.539999999999s)]
*  Because we should redirect all of our resources to mexico [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10568.5s)]
*  For tucker carlson, I suspect the war worth waging is with china. Okay at the domestic front [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10572.5s)]
*  The war worth waging for tucker carlson and marjorie taylor green and people like that are with first internally against socialists [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10581.06s)]
*  radicals, right [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10589.539999999999s)]
*  people who don't mind that america is a diverse nation [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10591.539999999999s)]
*  And ultimately the international war that needs to be waged is against china now, of course ironically enough [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10595.3s)]
*  I believe that ted cruz donald trump and the democratic party [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10602.82s)]
*  Are aligned with tucker cruz on the notion that the real war that must be waged is against [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10607.859999999999s)]
*  China, I think that they just have different methods of how to wage said war did I say tucker cruz ted cruz and and tucker carlson [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10615.14s)]
*  Okay, guys i'm on almost nine hours here. Okay, calm down [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10623.939999999999s)]
*  Calm down everybody. Yes. I said the wrong name. Haha [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10628.02s)]
*  I mixed their names of independent confirmation one way or the other you think that [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10631.56s)]
*  They should take him out [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10635.4s)]
*  So I actually talked about it as you know [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10636.759999999998s)]
*  I do a podcast every week verdict with ted cruz and I actually talked about it in the latest podcast and I said look [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10638.199999999999s)]
*  I've seen the reporting that says that trump asked them not to take out the ayatollah [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10643.0s)]
*  And what I said the podcast is I think it's reasonable for them to decide not to try to take him out what they've done is [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10646.919999999998s)]
*  targeted [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10652.839999999998s)]
*  Just about the entire bro. I put my head down for like [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10653.96s)]
*  20 seconds and they're still spamming tucker cruz in the chat. That's crazy [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10658.3s)]
*  Y'all are so one note. That's crazy. There are still people spamming tucker cruz in the chat [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10664.699999999999s)]
*  What is happening? Also? Yeah, you guys noticed that plug tucker cruz did a plug on the ted carlson show [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10672.38s)]
*  The top level of the military the people that actually conduct the war [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10679.66s)]
*  um [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10683.58s)]
*  I can see an argument that taking out both the head of state and a religious leader could make him a martyr and [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10685.84s)]
*  Could cause more problems than it's worth [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10692.4s)]
*  And by the way, if you take out the ayatollah, I don't know that the next guy isn't just as bad [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10694.88s)]
*  And and so I am what happens to the country [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10698.96s)]
*  I I don't know but you mentioned before I want to go back to this. You said something like oh my god [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10702.88s)]
*  This is an interesting moment where ted. Oh my god almost said ted carlson again [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10707.84s)]
*  Tucker carlson almost by accident mentioned what happens to the country as in for a brief moment. We almost got them to [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10712.5s)]
*  Think about the civilian death toll [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10721.38s)]
*  just for a moment one hour and 26 minutes and this was about to be the first time that they talk about the [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10724.58s)]
*  the the population of iran [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10732.82s)]
*  Or any of these countries that america is like bombing or or facilitating the death and destruction of [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10735.64s)]
*  Almost we got these clothes [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10743.16s)]
*  and they're moving on like [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10746.119999999999s)]
*  You like most other politicians are are engaged in in moral terms [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10748.279999999999s)]
*  And let me be clear. I am talking about national interest. I am talking about protecting america [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10753.48s)]
*  So there are bad guys on planet earth that I don't think we should take out even though they're bad guys good [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10759.4s)]
*  I'll call them bad guys, but but i'm not willing to use us military force to take them out [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10763.82s)]
*  In this instance [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10770.3s)]
*  What israel is doing is taking out their capacity to build nuclear weapons [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10771.98s)]
*  Why because they judge judge the the risk is too high if they got nuclear weapons [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10777.099999999999s)]
*  I understand that I mean I understand that I think it's in progress [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10781.42s)]
*  I think it'll probably be achieved probably with us military support who knows [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10784.38s)]
*  But the president said he's for that and by the way where the military support is most needed is fordow [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10787.98s)]
*  Which is the under it's a bunker that's built under a mountain right and [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10793.28s)]
*  Israel's taken out most of the rest like the tans which is their big enrichment [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10798.08s)]
*  Site they bombed the hell out of it fordow was deliberately built deep into a mountain so that israel couldn't take it out [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10802.16s)]
*  And and there's an active discussion because the u.s. Has bunker buster bombs that are big enough to take out fordow [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10808.24s)]
*  30 000 pounds and israel doesn't so so the one military piece that nor the aircraft to fly them right you too right but but [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10814.800000000001s)]
*  Here's I guess what bothers me is that I said two weeks ago the real goal here is regime change in iran [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10821.86s)]
*  It's not I think that's trump's goal. And I don't it's your goal. It's israel's goal. I'm not attacking anyone [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10827.300000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying it's important to be honest and not lie and not so I believe i've been assiduously honest in this but but words matter [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10832.26s)]
*  You said the real goal here is regime change and it's your goal and I want to be clear [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10838.98s)]
*  Well, you said it was your goal. I want to be clear because words matter [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10843.22s)]
*  Do I support regime change and what I like a government that doesn't hate america isn't trying to kill us in iran? [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10847.0s)]
*  Yes, that's a good outcome [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10852.28s)]
*  Is that the objective of these military strikes? I don't think necessarily. I don't know if it's [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10854.84s)]
*  Israel's it's not my objective. My objective is taking out us if israel decides we're going to [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10861.16s)]

*  Nations in war have refrained from from killing heads of state I [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10959.84s)]

*  Doing whatever is necessary to stop him from getting nuclear weapons in the first trump term what that meant was maximum pressure [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10967.960000000001s)]
*  So in the first trump term I spent a lot of time urging the president to withdraw from the disastrous [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10973.92s)]
*  Iranian nuclear deal that Obama had president trump agreed with me [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10979.42s)]

*  Up crippling their economy so so Iran at the time was selling two million barrels of oil a day [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10989.1s)]
*  One million barrels. I'm sorry one million barrels of oil a day when president trump ended the oil waivers it [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=10994.98s)]
*  Cut their sales to three hundred thousand barrels a day at the end of the trump term the Iranian economy was in shambles [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11001.779999999999s)]
*  They had massive inflation. I think the regime was teetering. I think it might have fallen [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11008.52s)]
*  I would use economic sanctions, and I would use moral suasion to try to effectuate if you [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11012.28s)]
*  Okay, so you topple the regime and by whatever means what happens then how many people living around by the way? [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11018.08s)]

*  It's kind of relevant because you're calling for the overthrow of the government [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11041.64s)]
*  Why is it relevant whether it will be because I need million or 80 million or a hundred million? [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11044.92s)]
*  What why is that you don't know anything about the country? I didn't say I don't know anything about okay? [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11048.68s)]

*  Cinema that's it. I mean it's this tanks people's candidacy ever like I don't think this will [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11069.94s)]
*  Hurt the support that Ted Cruz receives [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11077.699999999999s)]
*  but it's such a fantastic gotcha the showcase the absolute depravity of [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11081.38s)]
*  American politicians that [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11088.66s)]
*  Basically talk about death and destruction over there [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11091.58s)]
*  without even knowing basic facts [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11095.24s)]
*  About the people whose death sentence that they're signing off on this isn't to make it so that like if Tucker [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11098.18s)]
*  I mean if Ted Cruz knew off the top of his dome [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11104.5s)]
*  You know what the number of people are in Iran? [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11109.86s)]
*  But the very fact that he doesn't know makes it all that more damning [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11113.34s)]
*  You know what I mean like I wouldn't be on board with Ted Cruz saying that we have to [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11117.14s)]
*  Let he'd be on board with like regime change or bombing Iran bombing the Iranian nuclear sites [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11123.359999999999s)]

*  The fact that he doesn't know makes us so much worse. No, you don't know anything about the country [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11136.16s)]
*  You're the one who claims they're not trying to murder Donald Trump [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11140.64s)]
*  Who can't figure out a good idea to kill General Soleimani and you said it was bad. They're trying to murder Trump [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11144.24s)]
*  You're not calling for military strikes against them in retaliation [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11150.339999999998s)]
*  They really believe that carrying out military strikes today. You said Israel was right with our help [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11153.46s)]
*  I'm said we Israel is leading them, but we're supporting them [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11158.58s)]
*  Well this you're breaking news here because the US government last night denied the National Security Council spokesman Alex Pfeiffer denied on behalf of Trump [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11162.099999999999s)]
*  That we were acting on Israel's behalf in any offensive capacity bombing them Israel's bombing them. You just said we were [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11169.58s)]
*  We are supporting [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11176.84s)]
*  If you're saying the United States government is a war with Iran right now people are listening we are not bombing them [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11179.32s)]
*  Israel is bombing them. Why do you do this night? Oh, okay [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11185.6s)]
*  I mean because it's this is super high-stakes stuff [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11189.16s)]
*  It's this is a huge country that borders a lot of other important countries all worlds energy comes from there [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11191.6s)]
*  So let me don't want another disaster [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11197.0s)]
*  You don't know Tucker the ayatollah refers to Israel as the little statement America is the great thing [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11199.480000000001s)]

*  Do you think you think if the ayatollah could murder both of us right now that he would I? [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11207.1s)]
*  Do I believe him? Okay? I assume no good faith in the part of the ayatollah [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11212.1s)]
*  And if your implication is like I'm good ayatollah or something. No, it's not good faith. It's that just saying you're a lawmaker [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11216.460000000001s)]
*  You're a powerful person and like the answer here is a lot of people would want us dead [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11223.5s)]
*  Do you think we should? [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11228.380000000001s)]
*  Do targeted first strikes on a nation of [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11230.26s)]
*  92 million people as punishment like [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11235.12s)]
*  Like Nazis want me dead. I wouldn't advocate to kill them and their families. You know what I mean [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11239.36s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I do the opposite I advocate for them to have health care [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11245.72s)]
*  Regardless in Washington. This is the most powerful country in the world if you're calling for toppling in government [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11249.6s)]
*  It's incumbent on you to know something about the country and to think through the consequences of that and you have it and you don't [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11254.7s)]
*  And I'm saying that I thought okay you are [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11259.24s)]
*  You engage in reckless rhetoric with no facts and to be clear [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11263.06s)]
*  I'm not calling you the overthrow of a government you are put out a newsletter attacking Donald Trump and calling him complicit [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11267.18s)]
*  I'm not attacking Donald Trump. Yes, you have and and by the way pain for Donald Trump. Yes, this is like after anti-semitism [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11273.34s)]
*  This is the last refuge you're an okay. I love Trump [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11280.78s)]
*  I will read you put out a whole newsletter saying Trump is abandoned America first [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11283.98s)]
*  And here's what Trump said in response [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11287.92s)]
*  Well considering that I'm the one that developed America first and considering that the term wasn't used until I came along [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11289.92s)]
*  I think I'm the one who decides that for those people who say they want peace [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11295.06s)]
*  You can't have peace if Iran has a nuclear weapon [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11299.039999999999s)]
*  So for all of those wonderful people who don't want to do anything about Iran having a nuclear weapon [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11301.72s)]
*  That's not peace [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11307.16s)]
*  What one model for the action that Trump's allies have discussed privately in recent weeks is 2020 decision to assassinate top Iranian commander [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11308.24s)]
*  Suleimani the strike while still a serious escalation that drew reprisals from Iran did not cause all-out war they argue. Oh [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11314.300000000001s)]
*  my lord, oh [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11321.18s)]
*  They're they're just looking for justifications a key voice in Trump's ear has been general Michael Corilla commander the US Central Command [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11323.220000000001s)]
*  He's a real freak in recent weeks [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11330.220000000001s)]
*  Some US military leaders including Corilla have requested more resources defend and support Israel as it continues to trade fire with Iran [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11332.140000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they're looking for ways to sell it [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11337.5s)]
*  He had better information about what Israel was up to than anyone else in our government Eric Corilla a US general close to Israel [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11340.84s)]
*  Who helped craft his post October 7 wars is wielding major influence on Trump's decision-making over a US war with Iran [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11346.52s)]
*  Some say Corilla is extremely close to Israel even by the standards of other US officials and is empowered [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11352.2s)]
*  Emboldened as hex at is dominated by scandal Trump fires diplomats and fealty drives others [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11358.24s)]
*  He described Israel's tactics a model and is seen as focused on his legacy ahead of his looming retirement [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11363.8s)]
*  Many US officials under Biden and Trump have bought the narrative pushed by BB and US Hawks [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11370.12s)]
*  That they can be seen as historic successes for bolstering Israel in the region [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11373.92s)]
*  It's also a way to distract from the human and strategic toll of their policies [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11378.84s)]
*  Corilla is hawkish but reasonable per former US official. He has previously told Trump [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11382.48s)]
*  He's pre-stall Israel Trump did not want to hit Iran his outsize influence and clear viewpoint raised questions about civil military balance [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11386.6s)]
*  However, particularly given Trump's worship over the military [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11392.68s)]
*  With admin dynamics suggesting Trump will join Israel in striking Iran Congress is seeking to exert pressure [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11395.900000000001s)]
*  Rokana predicted big support from DS even ours challenging Hawks remains an uphill battle in DC [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11401.900000000001s)]

*  Think that we should be very careful about entering into more foreign wars that don't help us when our country is dying [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11423.16s)]
*  What when you say our country is dying? [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11430.24s)]
*  Yes focus on our country. I'm all for it. But but the the naivete you don't even know how much money this costs [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11433.24s)]
*  You don't know anything about the country whose government you want to throw overthrow and you're calling me reckless [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11439.800000000001s)]
*  He's right. I can't believe I'm saying this once again [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11445.6s)]
*  He's right I can't believe I'm saying this once again a thing that I've mentioned so many times now [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11448.9s)]
*  More than I ever care to admit [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11455.38s)]
*  once this process is over but Tucker Carlson is right the [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11457.66s)]
*  American senator the average American senator is so morally repugnant and so stupid that they make a [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11461.699999999999s)]
*  propagandist white nationalist [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11469.06s)]
*  like Tucker Carlson [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11471.46s)]
*  Look like a beacon of morality and consideration in comparison. How is that even possible? [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11473.24s)]
*  Like Tucker's position here being like we should maybe Tucker's position there is [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11480.599999999999s)]
*  basically a restructured format of something that I always say which is all of the money that we spend is the Eisenhower [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11485.96s)]
*  Statement right all the money that we spend over there all the money that we spend overseas on [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11495.08s)]
*  Bombing other countries could be spent here domestically building schools [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11500.339999999998s)]
*  Every dollar spent on making rockets is a dollar that could be spent on [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11505.98s)]
*  making roads [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11511.3s)]
*  right and this is a [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11513.099999999999s)]
*  major issue with the way that our government is organized nowadays especially because like [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11515.619999999999s)]
*  the military industrial complex is the most powerful force in this country is the most powerful industry in this country and the entire economy and our [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11520.539999999999s)]
*  entire political economy the entire realm of politics is geared towards an endless [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11527.3s)]
*  Continued effort to dominate the rest of the planet. So Tucker Carlson is basically saying [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11533.599999999999s)]
*  You you don't know how much money we're spending on Israel [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11538.92s)]
*  You don't know anything about the country that you are choosing the bomb. This country is dying [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11543.56s)]
*  When Tucker says country's dying, I think he means like there's too many Mexicans when I say this country's dying [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11548.519999999999s)]
*  I'm talking about of course the shitty infrastructure the lack of adequate health care for average Americans the lack of adequate education [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11552.859999999999s)]
*  for Americans [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11561.259999999998s)]
*  That's the that's a major difference between you know, I mean Tucker Carlson here [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11563.259999999998s)]
*  But the point still stands [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11568.179999999998s)]
*  I want to stop a lunatic who wants to murder us from getting nuclear weapons [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11569.779999999999s)]
*  I could kill millions of Americans there you say I can't see how that benefits American [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11573.98s)]
*  Anyway, that is bizarre and by the way, it's our isolationism your foreign policy is the foreign policy of Jimmy Carter in Barack Obama [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11579.1s)]
*  Why do you assume his thoughts bro Tucker ago bro have hope in people I know more about him than you do [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11587.720000000001s)]
*  That's it. I've spent a big chunk of my my political career covering his his statements and his worldview [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11593.960000000001s)]
*  That's it. It's as simple as that. I don't think this person's a Nazi chatters [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11602.12s)]
*  I think Tucker Carlson is a is a mischievous devil with a silver tongue and a lot of people fall for his shit [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11606.060000000001s)]
*  I know more about Tucker Carlson's background his personal history his motivations and the things that he believes [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11612.04s)]
*  Then most people do then the average person does for sure. I was hard right wing before but I've changed so much since I came to the US [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11619.880000000001s)]
*  Well, there it is. There you go [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11627.76s)]
*  Tucker is a [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11630.880000000001s)]
*  Tucker is a is a is a snake oil salesman, but he's also a whisperer for people like yourself [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11632.76s)]
*  Work. Yeah, I'm a big leftist. Let me this is so silly. I'm now I'm Jimmy Carter in Barack Obama. Okay, let me just see one less thing [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11639.28s)]
*  So how is your foreign policy different from Jimmy Carter's? [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11646.9s)]
*  seriously, please but [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11649.76s)]
*  Seriously, I don't even know what you're talking about. I'm [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11652.800000000001s)]
*  Jimmy Carter [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11657.32s)]
*  So what century is this? [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11658.52s)]
*  I am the product of the last 25 years watching carefully being involved in the periphery [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11660.2s)]
*  And I see an unending string of foreign policy disasters that have impoverished and hurt unending string [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11665.68s)]
*  unending string they would include Afghanistan Iraq Libya Syria and [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11671.36s)]
*  Our inability to stop the Houthis by the way in Yemen which exposes us as we can I grieve over that? [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11676.2s)]
*  So these are failures you help preside over some of them as a member of the Senate [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11680.880000000001s)]
*  What of what failures for policy failures have I presided over? [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11686.080000000002s)]
*  Well, we were unable to beat Russia in the war that you supported against Russia [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11689.52s)]
*  You you've been spending the last three years telling us that Vladimir Putin is evil and we're gonna beat him with other people's children [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11694.160000000002s)]
*  And a million of those kids are now dead. You've never apologized for that [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11700.2s)]
*  That's a full by the way [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11703.84s)]
*  Look the level of number of falsehoods you you lay out just in one statement or rather haven't supported the war against Russia [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11705.12s)]
*  Are rather stunning so the war against Russia he's also again he's not [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11713.36s)]
*  You're not entirely wrong on that front. I mean he's pro Vladimir Putin. He definitely is a [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11720.64s)]
*  He he definitely is a propagandist for the Russian state. He's gone to unimaginable lengths to defend Vladimir Putin directly [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11726.12s)]
*  interviewed him and [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11734.76s)]
*  Sucked him off the rest is Russia talk [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11736.44s)]
*  Was caused which I had explained in great detail by Joe Biden's weakness [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11739.960000000001s)]
*  Crazy how much they called out Russia for attacking another sovereign country while they're now doing the exact same thing just a different excuse in Putin [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11747.52s)]
*  I mean, is it even a different excuse than Putin? [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11752.76s)]
*  It's kind of the same reason [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11756.400000000001s)]
*  When you think about it Vladimir Putin was like this is historic Russia [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11759.2s)]
*  This is ours and that's kind of what Israel says too if anything there was a time frame [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11763.679999999998s)]
*  No, there was a there was a period of time that was not that long ago that Vladimir Putin can draw back from [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11770.56s)]
*  Whereas for Israel you have to go back three thousand years not that it matters. I'm not saying that Russia's ambitions is [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11775.359999999999s)]
*  Is just or anything? I'm not saying that at all, but like [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11784.359999999999s)]
*  It is kind of similar yeah, Russia said there's Nazis over there we have to kill them and [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11788.619999999999s)]
*  also [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11796.38s)]
*  This was Russia not that long ago. It belongs to us and we're gonna liberate [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11797.539999999999s)]
*  our brothers in [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11804.18s)]
*  this area that used to belong to us historically by by destroying the the [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11806.3s)]
*  Hamas Nazis I mean sorry as of Nazis and Nazis in general in the Ukrainian Parliament [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11813.179999999998s)]
*  The only difference is like in terms of conduct Russia has engaged in certainly a shit ton of war crimes as well [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11819.74s)]
*  but not to the same degree as Israel has because Russia is [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11828.22s)]
*  Outside of the sphere of American influence [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11833.74s)]
*  Israel is firmly in the lap of American influence and as long as you are an extension of America you get to do whatever the [[03:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11836.58s)]
*  You want and no one can say a damn thing, but that of course that that that juxtaposition [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11843.42s)]
*  Happening in real time in directs in [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11850.5s)]
*  sequence one after the other and America's response to one versus America's response to the other has [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11854.22s)]
*  Created this this perfect showcase because like I remember in the beginning like the way people used to talk about [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11862.1s)]
*  Russia invading Ukraine there were a lot of people myself included that [[03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11870.1s)]
*  talk about like the American hypocrisy and [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11875.02s)]
*  And talk about like how differently we view [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11878.62s)]
*  Palestinians, but at the time Israel was just simply doing an apartheid [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11882.06s)]
*  There wasn't like the the extra ethnic cleansing that it's been engaging in since October 7 [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11886.7s)]
*  So when people like myself made that point everyone was like, why are you defending Russia? I was like, no, I'm not [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11892.1s)]
*  I'm not defending Russia. I'm actually saying Russia's doing America shit and [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11896.74s)]
*  This is to criticize both Russia and the United States of America, but people couldn't comprehend it back then [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11902.26s)]
*  But then Israel did what Israel's been doing for the past year and a half [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11907.42s)]
*  So now that juxtaposition is impossible to ignore that hypocrisy is now impossible to ignore from [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11911.66s)]
*  The the perspective of like average citizens that are onlookers that are watching, you know [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11919.14s)]
*  If you want to talk we can talk Russian Ukraine. I'm happy to talk about it. I think that's been a success [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11924.939999999999s)]
*  No, it's been an absolute disaster. Okay, but you supported it shouldn't you apologize? No, you should apologize [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11930.74s)]
*  I'm not gonna engage in the demanding of apologize. So I'm like that's my point is [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11936.22s)]
*  Do you just throw out like you if you want to talk we can talk, okay, I do I want to know why [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11943.14s)]
*  That seems like a true disaster for the United States [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11950.539999999999s)]
*  You have supported it. Do you believe Joe Biden's weakness caused the war in Ukraine? [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11953.78s)]
*  I think Joe Biden's aggression caused it his aggression. What a great he demanded that Ukraine join [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11957.82s)]
*  Monkey D who the honestly don't think the position that Russia's acts are irredent is are true initially unread left to said it was imperialism [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11963.78s)]
*  It's not I didn't say that I said it was irredentism from the start [[03:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11970.34s)]
*  Like literally the day of the invasion. I said this is Russia's [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11974.060000000001s)]
*  irredentist actions against Ukraine. I mean, it's a it's a direct blow to [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11978.34s)]
*  Western imperial ambitions if you want to think about it from that perspective, but it doesn't matter [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11983.62s)]
*  It's still ultimately an incredibly violent and unjustifiable sequence of events that Russia [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11987.34s)]
*  Engaged in and the reasoning for why it's doing it the reasoning for why is doing it changes. I mean obviously ill [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=11993.54s)]
*  sometimes talk about [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12001.140000000001s)]
*  Sometimes talk about how we're like Ukraine is actually historically a part of [[03:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12003.42s)]
*  Historically a part of Russia liberation arguments things of that nature [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12008.26s)]
*  but [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12013.220000000001s)]
*  But ultimately it's still [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12014.34s)]

*  NATO how does that help the United States? [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12018.7s)]
*  It would is a terrible idea and I have vigorously opposed Ukraine joining NATO. Okay, so that's what caused the war [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12021.7s)]
*  No, it's not [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12027.74s)]
*  Did you want to know what caused the war look you do the dismissive? You're not actually interested in the facts. You're like, okay [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12029.42s)]

*  It seems super op you're absolutely right and I'm sorry that is a tick of mine that is wrong and I mean this with sincerity [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12036.3s)]
*  I'm sorry to do in what way is Ukraine been a disaster for the United States by the way weapons manufacturers got rich [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12042.38s)]
*  In the u.s. We can a historic enemy while making your upper line on American energy. It's been a total win for the rulers [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12046.62s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that that's good [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12051.42s)]
*  because I care about all the dead children and the civilians and the complete destruction of a 40 million strong state that [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12054.46s)]
*  Wasn't really doing great economically before this war either [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12063.34s)]
*  But it's certainly doing a lot worse and will probably never recover [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12067.78s)]
*  I don't think but I but I do think that when Tucker Carlson talks about that [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12071.74s)]
*  He doesn't actually mean it like when Tucker Carlson says like so many millions of people died like I don't think he gives a shit [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12075.46s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. Yeah for the record that chatter is not saying it was good for [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12080.66s)]
*  No, I neither do I I mean from the perspective of these freaks. Yeah, you're you're not wrong someone like Tucker Carlson [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12085.74s)]
*  Who normally would justify? [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12091.94s)]
*  American Empire would love Ukraine. He would have under normal circumstances the Lindsey Graham position [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12095.82s)]
*  5% of our military budget not a single active-duty servicemember dead and we've taken out 50% of our foreign adversaries [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12102.06s)]
*  Military I'd say that's a good bargain [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12109.78s)]
*  That's the Lindsey Graham position and that's the honest position that is literally the position of the American state [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12111.9s)]
*  Both under the Biden administration and most likely well, I don't know what the Trump is doing with Russia. I will be honest [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12117.18s)]
*  It's a little it's a little tricky to truly comprehend where Trump is going with Russia because he does [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12123.06s)]
*  Legitimately have a [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12129.98s)]

*  Do that to you I [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12145.5s)]
*  Just think it seems so obvious that sending Kamala Harris to the NATO Security Conference to say you're gonna join [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12147.18s)]
*  NATO is what triggered the invasion days later [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12152.94s)]
*  Okay, so can I this will take a few minutes to lay out yes, it's complicated but I think the facts matter I [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12155.66s)]
*  Think two things caused the war in Ukraine [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12162.02s)]
*  Number one, I think Biden's incredible weakness and the disastrous withdrawal from Afghan [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12164.78s)]
*  But it is Biden's incredible weakness in following the run Trump's [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12169.34s)]
*  Afghanistan withdrawal [[03:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12174.42s)]
*  Policy [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12178.02s)]
*  Okay, and [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12179.2s)]
*  Then also simultaneously I agree with him in in defense of Ukraine until now [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12181.02s)]
*  Because now Donald Trump doesn't agree with that. So now I have to act like I wasn't fucking you know [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12187.18s)]
*  cheering it on while some of those who trying to find ways of [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12193.26s)]
*  Criticizing Biden [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12197.22s)]
*  Afghanistan I believe we need to leave Afghanistan but not with the incompetence that [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12199.3s)]
*  Involved that led to 13 servicemen and women being murdered by terrorists there [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12203.82s)]
*  The way Biden did that was disastrous and I think our enemies looked to the commander-in-chief and said this this president is weak and when [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12208.699999999999s)]
*  When that that withdrawal was so disastrous [[03:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12216.779999999999s)]
*  I said publicly at the time the chances of Putin invading Ukraine have just risen tenfold, right? [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12219.38s)]
*  But secondly and and and this is critically I agree that was awful the withdrawal and and it was a major cause of [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12224.06s)]
*  Our enemies all said hey this president is weak and so it was Biden as bad as everyone says [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12231.14s)]
*  No, he's worse because they never fucking criticize them for the appropriate shit [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12236.300000000001s)]
*  They criticize him for the one good thing he did in his goddamn [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12240.26s)]
*  Administration in terms of foreign policy, which is the Afghan withdrawal [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12245.06s)]
*  Ironically enough. It wasn't even his own fucking personal policy was literally the continuation of the Trump plan and [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12249.54s)]
*  Everybody shit on him for it. That's the one thing as far as his foreign policy decisions that I [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12257.300000000001s)]
*  unconditionally [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12263.62s)]
*  Ten-toes-down defended [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12264.78s)]
*  Okay, every other aspect of his foreign policy has been a fucking disaster [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12266.94s)]
*  Whether it be refusing to try and immediately pack up the Ukraine situation to the best of his goddamn ability [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12271.74s)]
*  Or even if he was gonna warmonger slow rolling fucking weapons sending dusty ass equipment [[03:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12279.14s)]
*  Like not even doing the the warmongering aspect of it correctly [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12284.38s)]
*  Sabre rattling against [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12290.58s)]
*  Vladimir Putin thinking that like bringing in Finland and Sweden into NATO is somehow going to be a big prize for him [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12292.5s)]
*  Continuing along with Trump's demands that European countries [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12299.74s)]
*  Offer more of a higher percentage of their GDP for NATO [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12303.62s)]
*  Which when Trump did it liberal media thought it was disastrous for the record [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12307.62s)]
*  Even though it was an Obama era policy that Trump actually forced European countries to commit to obviously there's also the whole [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12311.18s)]
*  Genocide situation. I mean that that is an an [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12318.3s)]
*  unimaginable [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12324.34s)]
*  cruel [[03:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12325.3s)]
*  singular legacy tarnishing act I mean fuck his legacy obviously but like I [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12326.34s)]
*  Think Biden will be forever remembered as genocide Joe who oversaw [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12331.14s)]
*  The the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians Biden still executed the Afghan withdrawal poorly. No, he didn't let's cope [[03:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12336.619999999999s)]
*  It still sucks how he executed it now, let's just cope that's complete that's bullshit [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12343.22s)]
*  No, he didn't remember numbers on the board 13 of our best soldiers died, right 13 of our best soldiers died [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12347.26s)]
*  Okay, 67 soldiers died in Afghanistan when Donald Trump was overseeing [[03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12354.619999999999s)]
*  The the Afghan withdrawal that he never actually committed to if anything [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12359.98s)]
*  The Afghan withdrawal was fucked up because we killed an aid worker on the way out and his whole family [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12365.06s)]
*  The bombing in Kabul [[03:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12370.98s)]
*  But invited and by the way, look I despise all the people on the planes going crazy. I [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12372.98s)]
*  Mean as far yes. Oh, sorry. I [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12380.1s)]

*  It was disastrous and things that came after were also disastrous like freezing the assets of the Afghan government and refusing to [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12391.220000000001s)]
*  The the the newly constructed Taliban run Afghan government the billions of dollars that [[03:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12398.06s)]
*  The previous Afghan government had also shutting off any opportunity from NGOs from working with the Taliban government in [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12405.019999999999s)]
*  Afghanistan and making things [[03:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12413.5s)]

*  But these guys don't give a fuck about that. They're talking about how like 13 soldiers died. That's all they care [[03:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12425.26s)]
*  That's all they care about so even from that perspective is stupid. You're wrong about Afghan withdrawal [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12430.06s)]
*  He left Bagram. That was the main mistake and the US embassy was built to facilitate quick access to Bagram [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12435.18s)]
*  Pussy-ass take but I see your angle [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12440.54s)]

*  weakness and isolationism [[03:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12460.94s)]

*  Putin has referred to the collapse of the soviet union as quote the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century [[03:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12601.1s)]
*  And putin has long been explicit his desire is to reassemble the old soviet union and in fact reassemble [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12607.98s)]
*  Uh the the russian empire that was even bigger than that if you want to reassemble the soviet union [[03:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12614.46s)]
*  The natural place to start is is ukraine. Do you really believe that putin has territorial designs on eastern europe? [[03:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12620.06s)]
*  Yes, what countries he has said that you can go and read his hold on [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12626.22s)]
*  I don't want to lose the narrative of what happened so we can go back and do that [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12630.46s)]
*  But I don't want to lose telling the story first [[03:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12633.98s)]
*  so let me let me [[03:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12636.22s)]
*  Explain this and then if you want to go back we can take all sorts of digressions [[03:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12637.34s)]
*  But just give me a couple of minutes to lay out the facts of what happened [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12640.62s)]
*  He has wanted to invade ukraine a long time [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12645.18s)]
*  And he's done it before in 2014. He invaded ukraine invaded. Crimea when barack obama was president. He invaded the southern portion [[03:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12648.060000000001s)]
*  He did not invade the rest of the country [[03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12655.26s)]
*  Why? [[03:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12658.300000000001s)]
*  And the reason is the principal source of revenue for russia [[03:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12659.42s)]
*  Is oil and gas and the natural gas pipelines run right through the country of ukraine [[03:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12663.660000000002s)]
*  And he didn't want to jeopardize his ability to get gas to europe, right? So in 2015 [[03:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12668.46s)]
*  Putin started a project called nordstream 2 did anything happen in 2014 in terms of what wasn't there a coup in ukraine run by? [[03:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12674.939999999999s)]
*  the obama administration [[03:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12683.1s)]
*  Let me finish telling that I told you we'll take lots of digressions in a second [[03:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12686.3s)]
*  My position is in spite of any sort of ambition that america has in ukraine [[03:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12689.34s)]
*  Russia russia's invasion of ukraine is still ultimately unjustifiable make no mistake [[03:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12694.619999999999s)]
*  Okay [[03:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12700.38s)]
*  Whatever tucker carlson says about euro my don [[03:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12701.58s)]
*  I think ultimately the best possible thing for russia to do in that process in order to continue [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12704.3s)]
*  maintaining its sovereignty [[03:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12709.98s)]
*  despite [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12712.06s)]
*  American and western encroachment was to pull a china [[03:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12713.74s)]
*  Continue maintaining trade [[03:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12719.82s)]
*  and [[03:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12722.46s)]
*  and and [[03:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12723.74s)]
*  Continue developing decent relationships make yourself irreplaceable which would have been fine, but no also [[03:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12724.94s)]
*  An american mainstream broadcaster that is as popular as tucker carlson talking about euro my don [[03:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12731.34s)]
*  is [[03:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12737.82s)]
*  I assume he is an agent for russia at that point. Let me finish telling the the the the [[03:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12739.26s)]
*  narrative [[03:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12744.92s)]
*  No, i'm not talking to jeffrey sags. He's been saying this from before being putin began building [[03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12746.22s)]
*  Nord stream 2 nord stream 2 is an undersea pipeline that runs from russia to germany the entire purpose of nord stream 2 [[03:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12751.66s)]
*  Is when it was completed and turned on [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12758.380000000001s)]
*  It would let russia circumvent ukraine and get its gas straight to europe [[03:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12760.7s)]
*  In 2019 nord stream 2 was almost complete and the conventional wisdom in washington [[03:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12765.58s)]
*  Was this is terrible, but there's nothing we wait. What is this fucking argument? This is so dumb who gives this shit [[03:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12771.18s)]
*  What do you mean? You're mad at russia for [[03:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12777.1s)]
*  Developing pipelines [[03:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12779.5s)]
*  What doesn't this also make biden the goat then from your estimation he blew it up [[03:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12782.220000000001s)]
*  It blew up under his watch at least [[03:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12788.380000000001s)]
*  Like what how are you anti? I don't understand how he's like fucking anti biden, but also [[03:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12791.42s)]
*  Is is let's see. Let's see. Let's see where he goes with this. I didn't believe that [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12798.7s)]
*  So I drafted sanctions legislation that was targeted to stop the pipeline [[03:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12803.1s)]
*  My legislation passed the senate with overwhelming bipartisan support it passed the house and donald trump signed it in law [[03:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12808.32s)]
*  Why would can I just ask why wouldn't you want germany to have cheap energy? [[03:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12815.92s)]
*  Because it empowers russia and I believe in making our enemies weaker and our friends stronger [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12820.94s)]
*  Oh my god, bro, brother. What dude? What are you saying? Oh my god. Oh my lord [[03:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12826.800000000001s)]
*  First of all, germany is our friend from this equation [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12835.199999999999s)]
*  I think they would benefit tremendously from cheaper gas goes so hard if you're addicted to eating legos [[03:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12839.279999999999s)]
*  There is no [[03:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12846.56s)]
*  No [[03:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12849.279999999999s)]
*  real [[03:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12850.4s)]
*  Justification for trying to cut fucking [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12851.82s)]
*  The the pipeline there's just unless you're an environmentalist. I guess that's the one [[03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12854.96s)]
*  That's the one group of people I will say is is justified in their anger and resentment for for more pipelines, okay [[03:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12859.839999999998s)]
*  has [[03:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12867.839999999998s)]
*  Blowing up nord stream made germany stronger [[03:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12868.88s)]
*  Um not being dependent on russia has made germany stronger. Do you think germany is stronger now than it was four years ago? [[03:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12871.519999999999s)]
*  I think not being dependent on russia germany has all sorts of problems and many of them are domestic to their own politics [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12877.599999999999s)]
*  Hold on. Let me finish. I'm trying to no but what you're saying [[03:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12882.08s)]
*  Doesn't germany seem so much weaker now that its energy costs have spiked and the manufacturing sector is collapsing because of that [[03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12884.72s)]
*  Let me [[03:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12893.6s)]
*  Finish i'm focused on america's interest [[03:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12895.039999999999s)]
*  I don't germany did not want nord stream to anymore. Stop stop [[03:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12898.0s)]

*  Stop, come come on. Yeah famously [[03:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12904.16s)]
*  countries hate cheaper energy [[03:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12908.0s)]
*  That's the one thing [[03:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12910.64s)]
*  that [[03:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12912.4s)]

*  Please please stop [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12916.0s)]
*  That's it became an issue of major political consequence [[03:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12918.24s)]
*  even at the domestic level [[03:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12923.12s)]
*  while germans certainly uh plenty of germans certainly fucking [[03:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12925.04s)]

*  The moral authority on the planet [[03:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12953.68s)]
*  What country is providing energy to germany that you think is a beacon of morality chatter quick answer? [[03:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12956.0s)]
*  This is if we even assume that nations don't [[03:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12964.96s)]
*  This is even if we assume for a brief moment we suspend our disbelief [[03:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12968.96s)]
*  And we assume for a brief moment that countries actually operate with morality countries operate. Oh, you mean oh cutter [[03:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12973.6s)]

*  Anyway, it doesn't even matter. Yeah, you get it from cutter in the gulf arab states plus the u.s [[03:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=12992.32s)]

*  No, listen listen listen listen my point is [[03:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13000.32s)]
*  Morality doesn't even factor into the equation as evidenced by the fact that [[03:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13003.76s)]
*  Most of the energy providers are not exactly fucking beacons of morality themselves [[03:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13008.08s)]
*  Okay, but the notion that germany was not happy with getting cheaper gas [[03:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13012.88s)]

*  For safety purposes always offer cheap reliable energy. I think [[03:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13100.18s)]
*  I don't want energy from russia anymore [[03:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13104.9s)]
*  I'm going to conduct a secret underwater operation to blow up the pipeline instead of simply turning it off or cease paying russia [[03:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13106.9s)]

*  Uh, if I remember right at 7 pm on a thursday putin stopped construction at 6 45 pm. So the sanctions legislation worked [[03:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13136.58s)]
*  And it killed the pipeline [[03:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13144.66s)]
*  The pipeline lay dormant for over a year just to hunk of metal at the bottom of the ocean [[03:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13146.74s)]
*  Joe biden came into office. He was sworn in on january 20th, 2021 [[03:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13152.98s)]
*  Putin resumed deep sea construction of nord stream 2 four days later january 24th [[03:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13158.259999999998s)]
*  He did so because biden had foreshadowed weakness on that this issue that foreshadowing was accurate [[03:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13163.46s)]
*  Because several months later biden formally waived the sanctions on nord stream 2 and let putin complete the pipeline [[03:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13169.779999999999s)]
*  In january of 2022. I forced a vote on the senate floor to reimpose sanctions on last time last time america [[03:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13176.259999999998s)]

*  Fuck it. That was the last thing that biden did until he was like never mind. I'm gonna blow it up jack nord stream 2 [[03:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13189.22s)]
*  The week of the vote president zelensky in ukraine publicly called on the senate, please pass this sanctions legislation [[03:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13196.74s)]
*  It is the last best hope of stopping russia from invading ukraine [[03:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13203.619999999999s)]
*  At the same time the government of poland put out a formal statement from the foreign ministry [[03:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13208.26s)]
*  To the senate calling on the senate to pass my sanctions legislation and said if you do not putin will invade ukraine [[03:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13213.06s)]
*  the day of the vote [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13220.9s)]
*  Joe biden came to capitol hill. It's the first time in his presidency. He had done that [[03:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13222.9s)]
*  He went to the democrat senator's lunch and he personally lobbied. Do you think uh afd is popular is partially due to high energy prices? [[03:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13227.14s)]
*  I don't know [[03:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13234.74s)]
*  Like I said you make up your own mind, but I feel like unprecedented economic volatility [[03:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13236.34s)]
*  Paired up with uh, german history turns into [[03:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13243.06s)]
*  I don't know [[03:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13247.22s)]
*  Germans got one note whenever whenever the cost of living crisis increases germans [[03:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13249.06s)]
*  tend to move in a very weird way and considering that they're also, um developing a weapons industry now [[03:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13254.42s)]
*  Who knows who knows how things might work if I was austrian right now. I'd be kind of scared [[03:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13261.3s)]
*  I'd be looking at germany real weird. Okay, i'll beat them on this issue. Not any other issue [[03:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13266.58s)]
*  This was his number one issue that he came to lobby them on [[03:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13271.14s)]
*  They came out of that polish at lunch [[03:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13275.06s)]
*  Every democrat had voted with me twice against nord stream 2 44 democrats flipped their vote [[03:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13277.699999999999s)]
*  They voted in favor of russia in favor of putin and four weeks later russia invaded ukraine [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13283.619999999999s)]
*  That was the direct cause of the war and if trump had been president there would be no war [[03:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13289.46s)]
*  May I ask? I of course disagree with your analysis. Um, completely but I want to be respectful [[03:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13293.939999999999s)]
*  Okay, so tell me what you disagree with [[03:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13299.86s)]
*  It's it's such a long conversation [[03:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13302.18s)]
*  I've spent the last couple of years on this and I just respectfully disagree with [[03:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13303.62s)]
*  With your analysis, but I don't doubt your sincerity that you believe that putin is our enemy [[03:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13306.900000000001s)]
*  That it's western europe should not be allowed to use russian energy. I mean you seem to really believe these things [[03:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13312.34s)]
*  My question is about results because I think it's relevant to what we're seeing now in iran [[03:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13318.66s)]
*  You look back after having you personally voted to send billions and billions and billions of u.s [[03:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13323.220000000001s)]
*  Tax dollars to zelensky to support a civil service and the war against russia and all this stuff [[03:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13328.66s)]
*  Can you say that what you did worked? So I can say what I did personally? [[03:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13333.46s)]
*  Sanctioning nord stream 2 worked and prevented a war and if trump had still been there if the sanction had been in effect [[03:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13339.28s)]
*  There would be no war i'm in favor of avoiding wars, but once the war broke out you voted to fund it [[03:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13344.34s)]
*  To the tune of billions and billions and billions and to be clear and did that work? [[03:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13351.38s)]
*  Okay to be to be clear what I voted for I voted for the initial tranche of funding and then I voted against the subsequent [[03:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13355.7s)]
*  One so it hasn't worked. So i've been in between I haven't been [[03:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13361.380000000001s)]
*  on the full ukraine full-throated hawks side. Yeah, the only reason why you changed your position is because [[03:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13365.78s)]
*  Trump changed his position and the base very quickly moved away republicans are the funniest group of individuals man. I love [[03:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13372.42s)]
*  I [[03:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13380.26s)]
*  Love listening to republicans try to fucking play the song and dance here. First of all, there's never a war that they haven't enjoyed [[03:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13381.38s)]
*  secondly [[03:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13388.8s)]
*  secondly, it's incredibly funny that a group of people that carried over red scare resentment [[03:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13390.019999999999s)]
*  post the collapse of the ussr [[03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13398.179999999998s)]
*  in perpetuity [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13401.14s)]
*  Only fucking changed their position because they went and read a couple posts on a telegram group like how do you rewrite? [[03:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13402.5s)]
*  A major foreign adversary in your mind that you've been primed into fucking hating because you think they're communist [[03:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13409.539999999999s)]
*  Only to fucking turn around and be like I actually like them now because they're defending [[03:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13416.34s)]
*  uh the war against woke [[03:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13420.02s)]
*  that I will never understand I I do think that you could get republicans to be pro-communist, I think like with the [[03:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13422.5s)]
*  with the with a couple with a [[03:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13429.539999999999s)]
*  couple tweaks in the messaging [[03:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13432.42s)]
*  I think [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13436.1s)]
*  You could get republicans to be on board with communism like full gay space luxury communism [[03:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13437.46s)]
*  Not even like macro communism. I'm talking like straight up [[03:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13443.539999999999s)]
*  I mean think about how they fucking tweaked on on uh tariffs [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13446.9s)]
*  Trade protectionism they were they were speaking like a fucking [[03:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13451.539999999999s)]
*  1990s anti anti nafta union leader [[03:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13456.48s)]
*  They were taking it up to the streets being like yeah, fuck nafta [[03:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13460.66s)]
*  I hey I we need to do we need to do trade protectionism right now [[03:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13463.859999999999s)]
*  And then a day later trump's like never mind and then they were like brilliant masterful gambit, sir [[03:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13468.019999999999s)]
*  I swear to god if donald trump was like i'm a communist now [[03:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13472.26s)]
*  There would be a a significant boost [[03:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13475.779999999999s)]
*  I were the anti from day one. I voted for the initial tranche of funding [[03:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13479.539999999999s)]
*  Because I wanted [[03:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13484.099999999999s)]
*  russia to lose [[03:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13485.859999999999s)]
*  I think the biden administration administered it in a horrible way [[03:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13487.699999999999s)]
*  I think they wasted a ton of money and I think what they did was actually incoherent because they were funding both sides of the war [[03:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13491.06s)]
*  And I was very vocal and and among other things flooding 100 million dollars to iran [[03:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13497.619999999999s)]
*  Which was used among other things to help the nuclear program but also to make drones that russia used to fight [[03:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13502.66s)]
*  So here's my concern. I'm not going to defend the biden administration. Um really did a lot to wreck the united states [[03:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13507.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, did the most damaging administration where we sit now russia is stronger. It's closely allied long term with i don't know that russia's stronger [[03:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13512.5s)]
*  I don't think that's right. Okay [[03:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13519.7s)]
*  Um, I think it's pretty obvious that it is but it's certainly not destroyed [[03:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13521.7s)]
*  Um, and it's allied long term with china [[03:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13526.42s)]
*  Um, maybe that look that there's no doubt biden's foreign policy drove russia into the arms of china and that's concerning [[03:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13529.220000000001s)]
*  They also have a long history of animosity western europe is weaker and more in debt [[03:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13535.86s)]
*  The united states is weaker and much more in debt. Look hold on. So [[03:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13540.660000000002s)]
*  You and I are agreeing on a lot. We're agreeing. We're agreeing. Here's my question [[03:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13544.980000000001s)]
*  Have you [[03:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13549.539999999999s)]
*  Questioned any of your previous assumptions. Did you play any role in this at all? [[03:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13551.38s)]
*  Are you responsible at all? Of course and like you you said what if you learned of like you [[03:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13554.74s)]
*  You said you've changed your mind. Yeah, I voted for the first funding [[03:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13560.58s)]
*  Of the ukraine war and north stream was just bad. It was a good geopolitical move for russia in preparation for the war. I think [[03:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13564.74s)]
*  better trade relationships and and deeply [[03:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13571.46s)]
*  embedding yourself [[03:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13575.539999999999s)]
*  In the european markets [[03:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13577.86s)]
*  Is a surefire way to make yourself irreplaceable and uh, therefore [[03:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13580.5s)]
*  You have a lot more [[03:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13586.34s)]
*  You have a lot more options in terms of [[03:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13589.060000000001s)]
*  uh of avoiding [[03:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13593.62s)]
*  conflict [[03:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13595.78s)]
*  I voted against every subsequent funding stream because it wasn't working and I looked at what was happening and said [[03:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13597.220000000001s)]
*  This is not working and had the money been spent in an intelligent way and not wasted and had it been successful [[03:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13602.58s)]
*  I might have been willing to fund more but it wasn't successful. So I voted no and and the war is going to end look president [[03:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13609.06s)]
*  Trump campaigned on ending the war. I think he's frustrated because putin [[03:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13614.02s)]
*  Has been less than eager to reach a deal to end the war but it's going to end you're not going to see another dollar [[03:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13618.5s)]
*  Coming from he wants to end the war [[03:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13623.78s)]
*  um [[03:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13626.42s)]
*  I think zelensky [[03:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13628.1s)]
*  Has behaved horribly. I think his oval office meeting will go down in history [[03:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13630.5s)]
*  As the worst oval office meeting of any leader that has ever come to the oval office. I think he behaved like a pompous ass [[03:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13634.74s)]
*  and I think he is [[03:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13641.94s)]
*  Unrealistic, I think zelensky spends his time with nancy pelosi and chuck schumer in the new york times and he believed he was going [[03:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13644.4s)]
*  To the oval office as a resist figure and I think he's doing real damage to his country, right? [[03:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13650.9s)]
*  You described him many times as a hero [[03:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13655.140000000001s)]
*  Uh, do you I don't believe I don't recall ever using the word hero. I will say [[03:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13658.099999999999s)]
*  Look, i'm not i'm not a zelensky cheerleader and i'm not in the business of saying [[03:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13663.38s)]
*  Everyone we support has to be a saint and everyone we oppose has to be a villain [[03:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13668.98s)]
*  I'm not in the morality game. I'm in the u.s. Interest game [[03:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13672.26s)]
*  Why did I want nord stream quite literally are in that game? [[03:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13676.5s)]
*  You just your morality is just twisted [[03:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13680.42s)]
*  And you say all of all of america's enemies are true evil and all of america's allies are the absolute moral authority [[03:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13683.22s)]
*  You have said that over and over again for the fucking past hour and 47 minutes [[03:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13692.02s)]
*  Israel doing a genocide ultimately the best most moral country [[03:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13698.1s)]
*  Okay iran not doing a genocide definitely the most evil country that deserves to be nuked [[03:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13702.58s)]
*  That deserves a decapitation strike [[03:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13709.539999999999s)]
*  Too stopped because it would strengthen russia and russia's our enemies. It's entirely u.s. Interest. Did you support the [[03:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13713.06s)]
*  Industrial sabotage against it blowing it up. Um, so I think you believe america did that. Is that right? [[03:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13720.1s)]
*  Of course. Okay. I think the chances of that are zero. You think russia did it? No, I think ukraine did it [[03:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13727.3s)]
*  Okay [[03:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13733.3s)]
*  Come on man, I don't know so I don't know who did it [[03:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13735.699999999999s)]
*  Um in terms of the theories that had been put out there [[03:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13740.019999999999s)]
*  Um, the idea that russia blew up their own pipeline never made any sense to me at all that that just I can't even articulate [[03:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13744.099999999999s)]
*  Why they would do that? [[03:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13750.099999999999s)]
*  The idea that biden did that look I could see it being in u.s [[03:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13752.259999999998s)]
*  Interest to do that to blow up nord stream too. I just think biden was too weak [[03:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13756.42s)]
*  I don't believe joe biden but are you in I guess you and so so that leaves the norwegians the [[03:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13759.779999999999s)]
*  Ukrainians nato whatever look that seems me too [[03:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13766.099999999999s)]
*  You know who benefits and and it leads me to think either the ukrainians blew it up or ukraine's allies [[03:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13770.019999999999s)]
*  I don't think biden did because I just biden was so weak. I don't think he would give the order [[03:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13776.98s)]
*  Oh my god, he can't even hand it to biden. He thinks it's a good. Oh my god [[03:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13781.779999999999s)]
*  He thinks it's a good thing [[03:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13788.58s)]
*  But he can't get himself to admit that maybe biden played a role in it [[03:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13791.22s)]
*  That's so funny. You don't think ukraine did it you had that one girls that said it [[03:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13797.06s)]
*  No, I I think first of all, I don't think ukraine can do it on their own [[03:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13802.02s)]
*  Okay, I think there's no way it's like it's like when israel does certain things and you're like, oh israel did this on his own [[03:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13807.22s)]
*  It's like no, there's plausible deniability, but it's not [[03:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13812.82s)]
*  Especially with a country like ukraine. Uh, israel has its own espionage capabilities [[03:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13816.34s)]
*  but oftentimes like [[03:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13820.58s)]
*  America still gives the go-ahead has the knowledge and and offers tools [[03:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13822.9s)]
*  And especially with ukraine, especially with ukraine. I don't think ukraine has the capabilities of doing it on their own [[03:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13828.42s)]
*  The idea that it was like polish [[03:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13835.7s)]
*  The idea was like a polish infiltrators or something. I think it's silly. I think it was definitely a cooperative project between american [[03:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13838.1s)]
*  agencies and ukraine [[03:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13844.4s)]
*  Right, I find that implausible but you're in favor of it [[03:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13847.039999999999s)]
*  Look, I was in favor of stopping it. I think I think blowing it up [[03:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13850.08s)]
*  Like like do I think ukraine did the the drone strikes? [[03:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13853.199999999999s)]
*  Yes [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13857.359999999999s)]
*  I think ukraine did the uh the whole [[03:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13858.8s)]
*  Bringing the trucks full of drones like that's a complicated. That's a sophisticated operation, but I think ukraine has the capacity to pull that off [[03:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13861.84s)]
*  Especially because they're very good with drone warfare in general. I would go so far say that they're probably better than america [[03:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13870.0s)]
*  with respect to drone warfare, but [[03:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13876.32s)]
*  When it comes down to like an underwater deep underwater explosion [[03:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13878.960000000001s)]
*  that is [[03:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13884.48s)]
*  That the the level of expertise necessary to conduct an operation like that [[03:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13887.2s)]
*  is [[03:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13892.08s)]
*  Not something that ukraine has the capabilities of pulling off the north stream to sabotage wasn't that complicated [[03:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13893.76s)]
*  It was only 75 meters underwater that commercial diving depths and 100 kilograms of c4 ukraine absolutely had that capacity [[03:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13899.36s)]
*  I don't think so you're making it seem like almost comical when you're describing this like you're you're talking about it like it's fucking [[03:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13905.199999999999s)]
*  a bunch of western like a wild western where a bunch of [[03:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13912.64s)]
*  Thugs are putting tnt on the side of a railroad dude. That's like a sophisticated military operation [[03:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13917.759999999998s)]
*  like [[03:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13924.48s)]
*  What the fuck here? Yeah, they just walked up and were like you see it's time to blow up the pipe [[03:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13925.519999999999s)]
*  It's time to blow up this railroad. Here's my acme tnt like [[03:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13931.44s)]
*  75 meters underwater in the sea [[03:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13936.78s)]
*  I don't even know what kind of explosives net are are necessary to be able to conduct that timing that is incredibly important [[03:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13940.720000000001s)]
*  because if it fails [[03:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13946.960000000001s)]
*  like training for that [[03:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13948.640000000001s)]
*  Is is already difficult in and of itself unless you think that these guys are building pipelines like shit [[03:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13950.880000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean that can't withstand [[03:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13957.44s)]
*  Uh natural elements [[03:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13960.4s)]
*  Is a was a good thing hasan islamist fascism cuck. So so i'm i'm supportive of that [[03:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13962.720000000001s)]
*  But I don't think america did that I don't think biden gave that order, but in general giving that order, but [[03:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13969.76s)]
*  He wasn't in office [[03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13976.48s)]
*  Yeah, and you think that the largest acts of industrial sabotage in history [[03:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13978.08s)]
*  Helped our allies in western europe or other native fellow nato members. I gotta say I don't understand for some reason [[03:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13982.880000000001s)]
*  You [[03:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13989.439999999999s)]
*  Are really invested in defending russia and I don't get that i'm not attacking you with that [[03:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13991.279999999999s)]
*  I'm genuinely like I don't get why you're you're so passionate about defending russia. Actually I was defending [[03:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=13995.199999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's a pretty good. That's a that's a pretty good take from from ted and I think he's being honest when he says that western europe [[03:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14001.039999999999s)]
*  The home of my ancestors and that um, you know god, he's such a fucking [[03:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14008.96s)]

*  Helped drive putin into the arms of china forming a block that's larger than us. So you won't answer that question [[03:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14068.0s)]
*  I don't [[03:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14074.08s)]

*  With russia, I don't think it is in our interest to be at war with russia with china. That is a disaster [[03:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14102.800000000001s)]

*  But but I think putin is a kgb thug. I think he's not going to say that because they both want to fight china [[03:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14112.08s)]
*  He is a bad man. Now. I don't want to go to war with him over that [[03:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14118.48s)]

*  For russia and I don't understand. I'm well, i'm not attacking you when I ask why because i'm genuinely like I don't [[03:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14138.4s)]
*  Like when you called me and it said something you weren't attacking me. You were just noticing no, but may I ask you a question too? [[03:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14144.880000000001s)]
*  here [[03:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14150.48s)]

*  In response to their invasion of ukraine and one of the things it was they kicked russia out of swift of the international financial system [[03:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14159.84s)]
*  And my first response was this is going to really hurt the us dollar which it has and I hope someday [[03:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14165.04s)]
*  We can have a conversation about that. Um, it's really really hurt the one thing that we needed which was to retain dollar [[03:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14170.08s)]
*  Uh supremacy so I was interested in the in the economic condition, that's a reasonable point and a serious conversation [[03:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14177.599999999999s)]
*  I'm aware i'm aware and I was but I can agree with you like like no no [[03:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14183.76s)]

*  No, my point is it looked like that. It looked like a commercial isn't this wonderful? [[03:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14191.119999999999s)]

*  Like it's weird, especially for tugger carlson to do that [[03:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14201.36s)]
*  Okay, like a champion of us empire in perpetuity who still is seemingly championing [[03:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14204.720000000001s)]

*  Oh, can you imagine that fuck you are wrong ukraine population was used in abuse to provoke russia [[04:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14849.4s)]
*  Which is living under us empire hegemony. This position is your worst to be honest [[04:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14854.68s)]
*  I don't disagree that america [[04:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14858.68s)]
*  Absolutely fucking interfered in the affairs of ukraine because they did not want ukraine to be [[04:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14861.3s)]
*  In the throes of russian influence and it was a it was an entry point into [[04:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14866.52s)]
*  An area that is close in proximity to moscow [[04:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14871.24s)]
*  I'm i'm in disagreement with the way russia conducted itself [[04:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14875.16s)]
*  Okay [[04:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14879.720000000001s)]
*  That's it [[04:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14880.92s)]
*  I think that russia's conduct in terms of literally fucking invading ukraine was a gift [[04:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14882.68s)]
*  Was a gift to american generals the military industrial complex [[04:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14890.28s)]
*  It basically turned into a fucking major gift. Okay, there was a 50 plus billion dollar [[04:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14894.84s)]
*  Hole in the military industrial complex budget left after our withdrawal from afghanistan and we very quickly [[04:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14901.56s)]
*  Moved all of those numbers to ukraine [[04:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14911.16s)]
*  That's all it did [[04:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14914.92s)]
*  And in the process [[04:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14917.4s)]
*  Like lindsey graham says in his moments of honesty they didn't fuck they used five percent of military budget [[04:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14919.08s)]
*  Didn't actually kill a single fucking active duty service member [[04:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14924.92s)]
*  while simultaneously [[04:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14928.76s)]
*  Fighting and trying to actively cripple a foreign adversary russia's invasion of ukraine also [[04:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14930.36s)]
*  galvanized [[04:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14937.54s)]
*  europe's uh [[04:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14939.0s)]
*  europe's [[04:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14941.480000000001s)]
*  militarization [[04:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14942.74s)]
*  And and also caused two additional countries to join nato that previously had a handshake neutrality agreement [[04:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14943.880000000001s)]
*  It was just all fucked and now the entire planet [[04:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14952.76s)]
*  Planet [[04:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14956.2s)]
*  Is like before israel the entire planet was at the very least like thinking that they were on the morally righteous side and [[04:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14957.400000000001s)]
*  They were constantly patting themselves on the back the entire western [[04:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14964.52s)]
*  world and and america's fear of influence grew as a consequence of that because [[04:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14968.6s)]
*  All of a sudden nato was justified all of a sudden nato's existence was justified because the one reason why nato is supposed to exist [[04:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14972.84s)]
*  Because russian encroachment or the ussr right? It's supposed to be anti-communist formation [[04:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14981.0s)]
*  uh, it's a [[04:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14986.2s)]
*  it's kind of like [[04:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14988.12s)]
*  When the mafia comes over to your fucking storefront and says it'd be a real shame if your storefront broke [[04:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14990.28s)]
*  Because there's some other scary other, you know organized crime organized criminal elements out there [[04:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=14996.12s)]
*  and then [[04:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15002.12s)]
*  You you volunteer and you join the protection racket, okay [[04:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15003.560000000001s)]
*  But then there is actually another fucking gang down the line and it does break your fucking window [[04:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15008.04s)]
*  Up front and then of course all of a sudden you're like, well, maybe it wasn't so bad that the mafia was on my side [[04:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15012.76s)]
*  You know america's the first gang that came up and said you have to be a part of this fucking protection racket [[04:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15018.92s)]
*  The second gang is the russian gang that justified the first gang's protection racket [[04:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15025.32s)]
*  In cuba, I hate communist. It was actually batista that tortured my dad [[04:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15031.400000000001s)]
*  My aunt was in prison and tortured by castro. I hate communists. I think communism is evil [[04:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15036.12s)]
*  And so I think there is a value to there is nobody who stands up to communist china more in the senate than I do [[04:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15042.199999999999s)]
*  Because I think they're evil. Do I want to go to war with china? Of course not that would be ridiculous [[04:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15049.88s)]
*  But I think we have all sorts of tools [[04:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15054.119999999999s)]
*  To stand up to our enemies and I think china is engaged in a thousand year war against the united states [[04:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15056.519999999999s)]
*  They're trying to do so all over the map. We're your family in prison in cuba and china all this stuff. I just [[04:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15062.599999999999s)]
*  I I agree with you. I'm totally opposed to communism always have been [[04:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15067.64s)]
*  I don't question. What do you think of boy boys video blaming the u.s partly? Would you agree? [[04:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15071.8s)]
*  It's a good video to watch. I haven't seen boy boys video, but I of course the u.s involvement [[04:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15074.599999999999s)]
*  uh played a role in in uh [[04:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15079.08s)]
*  Russia's actions against ukraine think that putin loves us [[04:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15082.039999999999s)]
*  I i'm distressed by the moral condition of most leaders around the world most of them. They all kill people i'm against that [[04:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15085.48s)]
*  I'm just saying I wish the focus here. Can I say something? I actually don't agree with that statement [[04:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15092.119999999999s)]
*  They all kill people there's a moral relativism, so I don't think donald trump is a murderer [[04:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15097.96s)]
*  He doesn't kill people we don't have concentration. Yeah, donald trump a murderer [[04:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15102.039999999999s)]
*  I'm you just said world leaders all kill people and and there's a moral relativism [[04:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15104.759999999998s)]
*  I'm hardly a moral relative, but you are you just that statement was the essence of an anti-semite and isolationist and moral relativists [[04:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15109.72s)]
*  I'm okay. No, I'm not just say world leaders all kill saying i'm against killing people in general so [[04:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15117.56s)]
*  And hyperventilating about how putin was in the kgp or whatever [[04:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15124.92s)]
*  I just want to serve american interests and pushing into china is not in our interest at all [[04:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15128.52s)]
*  And you helped do it and you haven't apologized and you should and by the way, you're the cheerleader [[04:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15132.12s)]
*  I helped drive him into china. He's a complete lie. You funded the war against him [[04:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15136.28s)]
*  No, I I authored the legislation that shut down nord stream too that prevented the war [[04:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15140.68s)]
*  And and if trump had still been in the white house [[04:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15145.0s)]
*  We would have had the war and and look the comment you made the reason things like moral relativism are so dangerous [[04:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15146.84s)]
*  Oh, everyone kills people. No, there is a difference the united states. We don't have concentration camps [[04:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15152.36s)]
*  We don't torture and murder people you look at china where they've got a million prisoners in concentration camps [[04:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15158.52s)]
*  You look at putin where he's got prisoners in siberia [[04:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15164.6s)]
*  He tortures and murders his political opponents. Donald trump doesn't do that. America doesn't do that [[04:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15167.640000000001s)]
*  And by the way, what are you even talking about? Don't do that. I see the game. It's like i'm [[04:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15171.960000000001s)]
*  I'm distressed. No, i'm responding with facts. You don't like the facts [[04:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15177.800000000001s)]
*  The I don't even know what facts you're talking about. I'm not saying that trump puts people in concentration camps [[04:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15181.8s)]
*  I vote I campaign for trump. I love trump. So did I okay? [[04:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15186.36s)]
*  So this is nothing to do with trump. I'm merely saying when you said every world leader kills people it drop some more [[04:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15188.92s)]
*  Emphasis on what's happening inside the country. That's it. Is there a moral difference between america and our enemies? [[04:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15194.039999999999s)]
*  Is there a moral difference in america? And what is it? I'm articulated. It's valuable to say why? [[04:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15199.8s)]
*  Why are we a better country founded on better values than china? I'll tell you [[04:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15205.64s)]
*  What's the difference? I'll tell you why and I know I because the whole purpose of america is to protect the god-given rights [[04:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15210.28s)]
*  That each person possesses by virtue of being created by god. Amen by being human [[04:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15215.480000000001s)]
*  That's the point of our founding documents and no other country articulates that in the way that we do [[04:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15220.6s)]
*  And that's that's what I love about america. My family's been here a long time. I'm never leaving. So I really love the country [[04:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15226.84s)]
*  Despite going to a russian grocery store despite asking questions about apac. I love america is the truth and I and I love trump [[04:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15233.08s)]
*  So, but I just want more emphasis on america. That's it [[04:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15239.96s)]
*  I [[04:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15243.24s)]
*  Emphatically agree with america first. I think donald trump does as well [[04:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15244.74s)]
*  And I think his foreign policy has been vigorously protecting that and I I agree with the president good [[04:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15249.88s)]
*  Well, I appreciate your taking all this time. Sure, and I know you didn't mean it [[04:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBX3D28Rfcg&t=15255.48s)]
