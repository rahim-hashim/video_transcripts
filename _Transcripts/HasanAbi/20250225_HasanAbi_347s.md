*  my shit up. It was awesome, though. I love teeth cleaning [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=2.16s)]
*  and I hike and I very, very, very much recommend it. I [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=6.36s)]
*  recommend it for all if you have the money. It's fire teeth [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=10.32s)]
*  cleaning is dope. It's so damn liberating when you it's so [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=14.68s)]
*  liberating when you hold [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=20.84s)]
*  like I'm waiting for the implant and that takes a long time. I'm [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=23.32s)]
*  waiting for the implants and that takes a long time. And [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=33.04s)]
*  when, but in that process, like there's, you know, I had some [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=35.68s)]
*  screws put in, right? And whenever, whenever I go to the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=40.84s)]
*  dentist, my dentist is like, yeah, you got to take [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=45.6s)]
*  antibiotics. And this man has pumping me full of antibiotics. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  So basically, yeah, my crown broke chatters. Yes. So I had to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=53.0s)]
*  get an implant. And for that reason, I just like, especially [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=60.16s)]
*  because the implants are in the top, I need to like it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=68.16s)]
*  immediately cooks my, it cooks my sinuses. This is terrible. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=73.12s)]
*  Like, as you can probably tell, do you grind your teeth? Yeah, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  apparently I'm a big teeth grinder too. So hold your head up [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=82.56s)]
*  King. Your crown is falling. Yeah. Are you playing with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=87.36s)]
*  Jason in the three V three? Yeah. Yeah. I'm getting, I'm [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=89.36s)]
*  getting fake titties put in veneers. Oh my God. I've had to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=92.12s)]
*  had veneers put in. I want to get like, I've thought about [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=97.36s)]
*  getting veneers, but I'm so scared because I feel like, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  well, one, I don't know how to smile and my teeth aren't that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=105.92s)]
*  bad in general. Like, well, I just don't know how to smile. So [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=108.8s)]
*  I, and I feel like when people get veneers is like, they go [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=113.0s)]
*  crazy with it. And the veneers that they get, like, it's like, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  it's like Drew skis, right? Like it just basically makes you [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=121.44s)]
*  blind. It blinds you. But I also am scared because I didn't [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=125.72s)]
*  understand how veneers work. But from what I understand, they [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=128.84s)]
*  literally like shave your teeth and then just like slam, like a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=131.28s)]
*  white coat on top of it. It's fine. You can admit it to us, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=136.12s)]
*  dude. The coke addiction is getting out of hand would [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=139.0s)]
*  explain the night sweats too. Yeah. You don't clean your [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=140.8s)]
*  teeth. Yes, I do. What are you talking about? Since you don't [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=143.24s)]
*  clean your teeth, your veneers will rot out of your mouth. What [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=145.8s)]
*  do you, what chatters are so funny where like, no, in terms [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=148.24s)]
*  of getting my like actual teeth cleaning, I'm going to do that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=154.4s)]
*  I'm going to do that more frequently for sure, because it [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  feels so awesome. They do. That's why you don't need them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  They turn your real teeth in the nubs. Yeah, that's I don't [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=165.92s)]

*  you know, I've, I've thought about it before, but it's just [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=181.88s)]
*  like, it's too, it's too much. Don't give an ears, get add ons [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=184.27999999999997s)]
*  that can be glued to your teeth. They'll fall off periodically, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  but cheap to put back on. And in the event of an apocalypse, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=191.11999999999998s)]

*  know what I mean? And it's, it's just every time, every time [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=242.07999999999998s)]

*  liberating when you can just like do this, like push air [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=282.48s)]
*  through the holes, hole pockets in between your teeth. I don't [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=285.71999999999997s)]

*  flossing. Yes, I am, but it doesn't matter. No matter how [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=304.68s)]
*  hard you floss, there's still calcium buildup. God damn it. If [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=308.36s)]
*  you don't get professional cleaning, there's gonna be a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=312.24s)]
*  little bit of calcium buildup. Okay. And that calcium buildup [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=315.0s)]
*  basically closes those gaps a little bit. I don't know why [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBthaX2DN4U&t=319.08s)]
