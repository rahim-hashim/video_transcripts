# Hasan Is Appearing On Fox 11 | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU)
*  So it's not a secret that the county structure and the structure [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=0.0s)]
*  in the state is is pretty bad overall, like the conditions are [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  pretty bad. Overall, there's a lot of violence. There are major [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=8.44s)]
*  problems. And from what I understand, aside from the fact [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=11.44s)]
*  that being able to being able to volunteer for these programs [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=15.46s)]
*  allow these inmates to shave off some of their very long [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=20.3s)]
*  sentences, it also gives them an opportunity to train. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=25.1s)]
*  The Montebello Plymouth Congregational Church. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=35.06s)]
*  As soon as I heard that that Altadena's buildings had all [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=38.5s)]
*  burned down, there was no question that if they wanted to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=42.18000000000001s)]
*  worship with us, it would be a joint service. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=45.5s)]
*  Someone's going to reach out and invite us to come and they did. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=48.86s)]
*  What we saw was an amazing example of generosity. Church [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=52.099999999999994s)]
*  faithful side by side, dozen sought solace and the belief [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=56.48s)]
*  that faith moves mountains. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  It meant it means a lot to me. I almost didn't come because I'm [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=65.02s)]
*  using the sure mic. I already checked it. That's the first [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  thing I checked. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=70.66s)]
*  Hey, it's Todd. How you doing, man? This is KTTV TOC. Can you [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=71.25999999999999s)]
*  hear me? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=74.3s)]
*  Yeah, I can hear you. You're live, by the way, on my end as [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=75.06s)]
*  well. Just so you know. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=77.58s)]
*  19 homes from our congregation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  Okay, just I'll let them know. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=79.94s)]
*  This married couple took a final picture as they fled their [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=81.98s)]
*  neighborhood turned inferno on Tuesday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=85.58s)]
*  So I took this last picture. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=88.54s)]
*  I do not have food on my face. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=90.18s)]
*  Do I? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=91.62s)]
*  What I need for memory. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  At Sunday services, they found strength. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  To know that they put on this extravagant welcome for us is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  just heartwarming. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=101.86s)]
*  The church is not a building. The church is the people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=107.7s)]
*  And the church can worship anywhere. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=112.9s)]
*  So beautifully stated. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=118.22s)]
*  And I should point out too that the church is not the only thing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  that will be missing soon. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=123.66s)]
*  The pastor you just heard from, he has to resign soon because he [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=124.9s)]
*  has severe case of Parkinson's. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=129.06s)]
*  And so in the next couple of months, he'll be stepping down. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=131.5s)]
*  So that congregation is feeling loss from every supporting life [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=134.7s)]
*  program on a bill. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=139.42s)]
*  A lot of people showed up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=140.42s)]
*  I can barely hear you, by the way, sending it back to the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=142.9s)]
*  studio over the TV or programming. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=145.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  You know, programming. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they talk about this from a religious perspective of making [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=153.54s)]
*  Let me ask you, is it possible for you not to stream when you're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=153.78s)]
*  talking to us things that they can't explain? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=156.38s)]
*  I told Alex ahead of time that I was streaming already. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=159.26s)]
*  Well, you know, I am obviously one of the tenants of the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  Christian faith that sometimes terrible things can happen. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=165.42s)]
*  Life. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=169.38s)]
*  I don't have to be on the belief that there will be another [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=170.06s)]
*  chance that the broken hearts will be mended because of the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=173.74s)]
*  faith in God. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=177.7s)]
*  And so we saw a lot of that exhibited today. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=179.06s)]
*  A couple of people told me as broken hearted as they were [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=181.94s)]
*  about the thought that they lost their home, that they had [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=184.82s)]
*  received so many text messages, so many calls, people reaching [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=188.38s)]
*  out saying, you can stay here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=192.34s)]
*  I'll bring you clothes and all of that love and generosity that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=194.34s)]
*  is shown gives people the strength to go on because they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=198.7s)]
*  know that very soon the sun will come up again and the better [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=203.14s)]
*  days are ahead. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=206.94s)]
*  It is a promise that is given to us by God. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  And Laura, did you have the opportunity to listen in on some [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=211.42s)]
*  of the sermon? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes, I got to hear a little bit of it and we heard from several [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=218.26s)]
*  people speaking. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=221.54s)]
*  There was a visiting minister here as well and she was quite [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=223.14s)]
*  eloquent and her words too. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=226.98s)]
*  But mostly I think it was people being together. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=229.62s)]
*  The fact that they were able to pray together and hold each other [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=232.74s)]
*  and be together in their faith that gives them the strength and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=236.46s)]
*  the courage to go on. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=241.46s)]
*  And we all know that tough times impact all of us in many ways, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=243.06s)]
*  whether it can be sickness or like this, a sudden loss of a home [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=247.38s)]
*  or a spouse. But somehow you get through it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=250.98s)]
*  And being together is really at the core of what compels people [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=254.18s)]
*  to go forward. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=258.38s)]
*  It's always a little better with support from everyone. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=259.38s)]
*  Thank you, Laura. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  And that sense of community is just so, so important. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=263.82s)]
*  The energy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=267.3s)]
*  And speaking of community, we're seeing people from all over the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=267.86s)]
*  world coming to our aid, including our neighbors to the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=270.62s)]
*  South, firefighters from Mexico arriving at LAX yesterday to help [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=273.54s)]
*  in the firefight. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=278.06s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom sharing this video. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=279.42s)]
*  He was there to greet them in person. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=281.66s)]
*  They're joining the 14000 plus personnel already battling the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=284.02s)]
*  Palisades fire from around the country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=287.5s)]
*  And we learned that they have to be trained a bit. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=289.7s)]
*  So they're going to Beaumont first to be trained and then they will [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=291.94s)]
*  join other people on the fire lines, other fire professionals. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, today, Governor Newsom ordered another thousand members of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=298.98s)]
*  the National Guard to Southern California. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=301.94s)]
*  Fox 11's Mario Ramirez reports on their efforts. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=304.3s)]
*  Tens of thousands of residents remain under mandatory evacuation [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=308.06s)]
*  orders in this area. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  And now you can see here behind me, the California National Guard [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=312.78s)]
*  has moved in to help with wildfire efforts in the area. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  This is called a MACV. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  It's made to withstand explosives right now being used as a show of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=321.38s)]
*  force to deter criminal activity. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=324.9s)]
*  We're talking about 400 guard members that have now been deployed [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=327.14s)]
*  to assist law enforcement with traffic control and securing these [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  fire zones. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=333.78s)]
*  It comes as 20 people have been arrested for looting and evacuated [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=334.58000000000004s)]
*  areas between Wednesday night and Thursday morning. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=337.66s)]
*  Governor Newsom approved the deployment and every resource to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=340.98s)]
*  protect these communities. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=344.58000000000004s)]
*  Also warning that looting will not be tolerated. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=345.66s)]
*  Now, if we take a look across the street here from Woodbury and Santa Rosa, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=348.54s)]
*  it needs to be clear the amount of debris still covering the streets. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=352.38s)]
*  We've seen downed power lines and trees all over the neighborhood that have [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=356.1s)]
*  yet to be taken care of. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  As for the National Guard, Sheriff Robert Luna says additional Cal Guard troops [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=362.02s)]
*  will be deployed in the coming days as the Eaton fire continues to burn in the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=366.42s)]
*  hills above Altadena. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  In Altadena, Mario Ramirez, back to you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=373.7s)]
*  Thank you, Mario. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=376.58s)]
*  The weather, the key part of this story in the days ahead, our chief [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=377.34s)]
*  meteorologist, Adam Krueger, and a worrying forecast. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=381.06s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=385.94s)]
*  We've got the red flag warnings posted now through Wednesday. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=386.34s)]
*  We mentioned earlier, though, how it will be especially dangerous or [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=388.70000000000005s)]
*  particularly dangerous by Tuesday morning into Wednesday morning. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=391.66s)]
*  More on that in a moment. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=395.98s)]
*  But I want to share some little bit of good news with you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  And we've seen this from the aerials or if you've just been outdoors today, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=398.78000000000003s)]
*  you can see there's certainly less of a hazy appearance to the sky as the fires [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=401.22s)]
*  are settling down a little bit. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=404.5s)]
*  We actually have mostly good air quality across the area. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=405.82000000000005s)]
*  A couple of sensors right here measuring moderate air quality, but that's as bad [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=409.06s)]
*  as we see it right now. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=412.82000000000005s)]
*  It doesn't mean we're in the clear for the rest of the next couple of days or week [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=413.70000000000005s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=416.74s)]
*  But and we've seen the smoke and kind of like come and go. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=417.62s)]
*  But for the moment, we have actually pretty good air quality across a lot of the area. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=420.46000000000004s)]
*  But we have those wind alerts in effect. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=424.18s)]
*  And we talked about this earlier now. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=425.70000000000005s)]
*  So all colors right here are currently under a wind advisory. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=426.94s)]
*  But then it's these yellow spots that by Tuesday morning early at four a.m. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=430.02000000000004s)]
*  will officially switch to a high wind warning. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=433.86s)]
*  And that will be in effect until noon on Wednesday. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=436.42s)]
*  And that's when we're in that particularly dangerous scenario [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=438.26000000000005s)]
*  where it's extreme Santa Ana wind conditions, essentially. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=441.58000000000004s)]
*  And if a fire were to start, it could get out of control very quickly. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=444.62s)]
*  We've got those gusts that could be up to 60 to 70 miles per hour in those yellow areas. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=447.74s)]
*  But even in the tan spots, gusts could peak at 45 to 55 in these next couple of days. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=451.74s)]
*  Now, we haven't talked a lot about temperatures because it's all been wind [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=456.74s)]
*  focused and for good reason. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=459.7s)]
*  But I do want to let you know, I mean, we've got, you know, millions of people [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=460.94s)]
*  that are kind of away from these fires right now and just going about kind of normal [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=463.29999999999995s)]
*  weather and actually pleasant weather. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=467.09999999999997s)]
*  But I do want to say that we've got some pretty cold temperatures coming our way [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=468.38s)]
*  for tonight. And a large part of this is because the air is so dry. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=471.74s)]
*  And the winds are kind of calming down, especially around the L.A. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=474.5s)]
*  Basin area. And that's going to lead to some low 40s in parts of Los Angeles. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=476.82s)]
*  And then we go into tomorrow. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=480.7s)]
*  It's going to be a lot of sunshine mixed with, of course, some of the smoke in the air. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=481.82s)]
*  And we've got temperatures 60 to near 70 degrees in many spots. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=484.66s)]
*  And I'll just show you the seven day forecast, which I haven't even used. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=487.62s)]
*  And I think for five days or so, because we've been so wind focused. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=490.34s)]
*  But I just want to show you that there is no rain in the picture. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=494.26s)]
*  The National Weather Service is hinting at Friday through Sunday. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=496.9s)]
*  There might be something showing up rainwise. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=499.7s)]
*  I'm not quite seeing it on models, not buying into it yet. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=501.74s)]
*  But it'll be something to watch. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=504.38s)]
*  Of course, we would hope for a little bit of rain at that time. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=505.41999999999996s)]
*  But again, we've got those winds that will be an issue through Wednesday. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=507.78s)]
*  Then we're past the next upcoming Santa Ana wind event. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=510.18s)]
*  And we do expect a cooler pattern and some less dry air. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=513.38s)]
*  So slightly more humid air as we get into the end of this upcoming week. Guys. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=517.58s)]
*  All right, Adam, thank you so much. Up next, we're going to talk about the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=521.86s)]
*  incarcerated firefighters and their extraordinary work on the front lines. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=525.18s)]
*  Hassan Piker, one of the biggest names online, went out, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=530.26s)]
*  spent some time with them. He joins us live next. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=533.7s)]

*  Stand by. We're breaking that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=544.38s)]
*  You're Michael's for what I would give to be able to make art on the scale. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=545.7800000000001s)]
*  You will one day. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=551.1400000000001s)]
*  But it's equally important for you to be thinking about. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=552.4200000000001s)]
*  What's up, I can hear you. You can hear me. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=555.58s)]
*  Yes, yes. Perfect. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=558.7800000000001s)]
*  Hello to your crowd, right? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=560.4200000000001s)]

*  Very nice. Hi, everybody. Nice to see you. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=566.46s)]

*  Well, well, so we'll start off by just sort of talking about [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=574.5s)]
*  what what you saw out there and then what are the key lessons [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=578.3s)]
*  that we can learn from it going forward? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=581.6999999999999s)]
*  So we're going to be live on the Fox 11 in probably a minute or two. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=584.34s)]
*  And we appreciate you reaching out and thanks for the work you do. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=589.9s)]
*  I mean, it's important and I think it's good to highlight this. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=593.38s)]
*  Yeah, no, thank you. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=596.18s)]
*  You guys have been doing tremendous coverage as well. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=597.18s)]

*  He I mean, that was like directly on top of them. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=612.14s)]
*  So they had to evacuate by foot because there was so much chaos and traffic. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=615.4599999999999s)]
*  So I had to go pick them up in my car [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=620.66s)]
*  and they they stay with me overnight, but then they release the evacuation order. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=624.66s)]
*  So they're back. Yeah. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=628.38s)]
*  The firefighters did an amazing job on that one. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=630.3399999999999s)]
*  They like basically put that thing out in like an hour. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=632.66s)]

*  If you've been watching our coverage, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=697.7s)]
*  you've seen some of the firefighters that are out on the front lines [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=699.1s)]
*  are actually inmate crews, incarcerated firefighters. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=702.74s)]
*  Hassan Piker is one of the top streamers on Twitch. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=706.82s)]
*  He's actually streaming live on Twitch right now. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=710.94s)]

*  firefighters, streamed live with them and learned a lot from talking to them. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=722.94s)]
*  Hassan, good to see you. Welcome. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=727.26s)]
*  It's good to be back, Alex. Thank you for having me. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=729.34s)]
*  Talk to us about what you learned meeting these firefighters. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=731.86s)]
*  Yeah, so approximately at any given moment when there's wildfires [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=736.22s)]
*  happening in wildfire season in California, there is around 30 [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=739.98s)]
*  percent of the people fighting those wildfires are incarcerated firefighters. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=743.4200000000001s)]
*  The California, the California State and California have a collaborative program [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=750.0600000000001s)]
*  of the Forest Service where they basically train some of the incarcerated [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=755.3s)]
*  at what they call camps, conservation camps, where [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=760.9799999999999s)]
*  they learn how to clear brush and and reach areas that bulldozers can't get to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=765.14s)]
*  by foot. It's a lot of trekking. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=772.3s)]
*  They're going and putting their lives on the line, basically, to ensure that [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=774.38s)]
*  Californians are safe during wildfire season. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=778.54s)]
*  I met a now friend, Scott Budnick, who is a Hollywood producer. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=782.86s)]
*  He produced Hangover Project X and Old School and many other projects. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=787.74s)]
*  He actually started this thing called the Anti-Recidivism Coalition. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=791.66s)]
*  And I found out that he was actually working with the governor [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=796.1800000000001s)]
*  and also simultaneously expanding these programs. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=800.34s)]
*  And I got to meet some of the youth offenders. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=804.14s)]
*  This is a camp pilot program that they just started in 2023. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=807.1800000000001s)]
*  Where they, for the first time ever, are bringing in youth offenders, young offenders [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=812.38s)]
*  that have, you know, have been incarcerated under the age of twenty five or committed [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=817.46s)]
*  crimes under the age of twenty five that are now part of this training program as well. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=823.4200000000001s)]
*  And I mean, it was an incredible experience overall. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=827.98s)]
*  And one of the things that I was kind of shocked by is the fact that these guys just [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=833.22s)]
*  kept asking, like, why do you care about us? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=838.9s)]
*  Why why are you here? Like, they were shocked at the at this level of attention there [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=842.86s)]
*  because they don't have access to the news is readily available. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=847.8199999999999s)]
*  So they're not exactly aware that, like, there are a lot of people in the civilian [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=851.78s)]
*  population that's talking about these guys right now. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=857.9s)]
*  And one of the things that struck me was the fact that they understand that these are [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=860.5799999999999s)]
*  very dangerous conditions that they're putting themselves into, but they really are [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=868.14s)]
*  appreciative of the fact that they get a semblance of dignity and a way to help with [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=873.4200000000001s)]
*  these communities that they're a part of. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=880.82s)]
*  So it was it was truly a tremendous experience overall and eye opening. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=883.26s)]
*  And, you know, we talk about people going behind bars. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=888.4200000000001s)]
*  Most people that go behind bars are eventually released. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=891.62s)]
*  And so you want there to be a rehabilitation process so that they come out potentially [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=895.06s)]
*  even stronger than when they came in. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=900.98s)]
*  And I know for you, you were really struck by the sense of hope that these guys felt. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=903.18s)]
*  Yeah. So it's not a secret that the county jail structure and the prison structure in [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=909.02s)]
*  the state is is pretty bad overall. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=914.18s)]
*  Like, the conditions are pretty bad overall. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=917.18s)]
*  There's a lot of violence. There are major problems. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=918.66s)]
*  And from what I understand, aside from the fact that being able to being able to volunteer [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=922.02s)]
*  for these programs, allow these inmates to shave off some of their very long sentences. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=928.86s)]
*  It also gives them an opportunity to train and potentially an opportunity for gainful [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=936.18s)]
*  employment after they're out, after they are released. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=941.66s)]
*  And there have been a lot of initiatives to make sure that this is as ethical of a [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=945.3s)]
*  process as possible, especially in recent years. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=951.06s)]
*  In the past, a lot of these firefighters, a lot of the incarcerated firefighters can [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=953.54s)]
*  only get seasonal employment and they could never get municipal employment in the Los [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=957.5799999999999s)]
*  Angeles Fire Department because if you have a felony, you're not able to get an EMT [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=964.02s)]
*  certification. And if you can't get an EMT certification, you can't become a municipal [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=968.78s)]
*  firefighter. But nowadays they're they're working on expunging some of the records as [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=973.18s)]
*  well for demonstrating good behavior and service for the community. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=978.54s)]
*  And I think it's wonderful because one of the things that I heard from virtually every [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=983.2199999999999s)]
*  single person there was the anxieties that they had as far as what they will do once [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=988.54s)]
*  they are released, what they like, how will they find an opportunity to reintegrate into [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=993.54s)]
*  society? This is something that obviously I read extensively on. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=999.86s)]
*  There's a lot of data available on this, but it was it was truly interesting just seeing [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1004.0999999999999s)]
*  it in person where these guys were also talking about the anxieties that they have about [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1009.3399999999999s)]
*  like wanting to become productive members of society. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1015.9s)]
*  And this program, I think, is fantastic. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1018.6999999999999s)]
*  And there are still some issues, of course, specifically around their wages. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1022.2199999999999s)]
*  I think since the 80s, they had not seen any meaningful wage increases. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1028.7s)]
*  I believe they were getting around five dollars a day. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1035.1799999999998s)]
*  And they're doing basically the same thing that everyone else in CAL FIRE is doing as [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1038.3799999999999s)]
*  well. One of the hardest jobs on the line, basically. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1042.06s)]
*  And now that wage has been increased to twenty four dollars a day. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1046.3s)]
*  And I feel like it's a it's a wonderful opportunity for reintegration, it's a wonderful [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1050.26s)]
*  opportunity for rehabilitation. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1056.5s)]
*  And the conditions of the camps are significantly better overall than the conditions of [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1058.26s)]
*  the prisons. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1062.5s)]
*  But having said that, I think that there's still room to grow. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1064.54s)]
*  This program could grow as well. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1068.26s)]
*  And hopefully their wages can be fair in terms of adequate compensation, because. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1070.42s)]
*  Utilizing incarcerated firefighters as a way to displace the existing [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1080.3s)]
*  non-incarcerated firefighters is also lowering the wages of non-incarcerated [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1086.58s)]
*  firefighters. Hassan, thank you so much for bringing this issue to our attention. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1091.78s)]
*  We really appreciate it and appreciate the work you're doing. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1095.9s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much for having me. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vamQl7XEVbU&t=1099.1s)]
