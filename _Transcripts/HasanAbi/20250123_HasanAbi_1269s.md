# Trump's Middle East Envoy Reveals New Progress With Hamas  | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc)
*  real estate developer that is just a normie otherwise who plays golf with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump can do it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=6.2s)]
*  Because he is the physical manifestation of Donald Trump in that room. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=6.92s)]
*  And Donald Trump has said, get this deal done. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=12.72s)]
*  That's it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=15.68s)]
*  Every moment, every moment that Steve Witkop speaks about the successes of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=16.44s)]
*  the ceasefire is yet another moment where you should realize that the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=22.66s)]
*  democratic party with the endless amount of, of pedigree that they had in terms [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=28.56s)]
*  of foreign policy just truly did not want to do this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=34.4s)]
*  So Stevie Stevie boy came in, came in hot and he had a lot to say. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=44.72s)]
*  And apparently it was quite controversial for many people special [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=50.44s)]
*  on by to the middle East. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=53.96s)]
*  He was certainly a key player in the negotiations and the deal between Israel [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=55.96s)]
*  and Hamas. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=59.4s)]
*  Thank you for being on our show and thank you for being willing to serve the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=60.2s)]
*  country as well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=62.64s)]
*  Wanted to ask you about Hamas. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=64.0s)]
*  Apparently they told the New York Times, we are prepared for a dialogue with [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=65.28s)]
*  America and achieving understandings on everything. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=69.52s)]
*  How do you see that? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=73.28s)]
*  Well, I think it's good if it's accurate. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  I think we were able to demonstrate that president Trump's policies piece [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  through strength. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=80.84s)]
*  They work. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=82.4s)]
*  Everybody listens and, and, and getting those three people out, that was a big [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=83.36s)]
*  deal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=88.72s)]
*  We've got four more coming out, I believe this weekend. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=88.96s)]
*  And it's a testament to, to how the world perceives president Trump's presidency. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=92.16s)]
*  When you met with these leaders, whether it was in Qatar or in Jerusalem, how did [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  you deliver that message that convinced them that you mean business and so does [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=104.16s)]
*  Trump? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=108.24s)]
*  Well, I, you know, Bill, I said, I said, you've got to, you got to look at the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=108.52s)]
*  tweet, look at the truth, look at what he said. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=113.32s)]
*  The words speak for itself. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=116.28s)]
*  He expects a hostage release. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=118.24s)]
*  Remember we were working, we had nothing to do with the mathematics behind the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=119.8s)]
*  prisoner release and the hostage release. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  That was set way, probably, I don't know, 11, 12 months ago in the, in the so [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=127.28s)]
*  called May 27th protocol that was agreed to. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=132.44s)]
*  By Hamas, by the Israelis and monitored by, by the United States under the Biden [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=135.44s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=141.28s)]
*  So that's, that set the mathematics around how many, how many Palestinians in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=141.88s)]
*  Israeli jails would be released for each hostage who was coming out. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=148.68s)]
*  Our job was to speed up the process because it felt like it had bogged down. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=152.56s)]
*  And so, so I think that's the way we've been working. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=157.52s)]
*  It felt like it had bogged down. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  And so, so that, that was the job and we were able to get it done. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=163.12s)]
*  And it doesn't happen without the president. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=168.08s)]
*  It's, it's, it's on track for the moment and we'll see what happens next. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=169.96s)]
*  Phase two and on and on and on. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=173.88s)]
*  I was watching you at the end of the inauguration in the Rotunda on Capitol [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=176.16s)]
*  Hill. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=179.84s)]
*  And when now the former president was walking out, you stopped, grabbed his [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  hand and had some words with him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=184.68s)]
*  Um, what did you say that you want our audience to understand about your [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=186.84s)]
*  message that moment? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=190.64s)]
*  I said, thank you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=193.83999999999997s)]
*  I said, thank you for allowing me to work on this, uh, on this peace deal [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=195.27999999999997s)]
*  because it was important. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  And I wanted to thank him for that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=202.32s)]
*  And what do you say? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=203.76s)]
*  He said, thank you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=206.64s)]
*  Simple enough. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  Sir, could you project? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  Jared Kushner could never, I mean, dude, it's anyone could do this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=212.44s)]
*  I want to stress this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=216.83999999999997s)]
*  I want to stress this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=218.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=219.2s)]
*  This man is not a particularly brilliant man. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  And the only reason why he comes across like a breath of fresh air, I guess, is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  because the tools that he has at his disposal are endless. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=230.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=236.04s)]
*  Anyone could do it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=238.44s)]
*  Anyone could do it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  A real estate developer that is just a normie otherwise who plays golf with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=240.6s)]
*  Donald Trump can do it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=247.64s)]
*  Because he is the physical manifestation of Donald Trump in that room. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump has said, get this deal done. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=254.16s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=257.08s)]
*  Every moment, every moment that Steve Wyckoff speaks about the successes of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=257.88s)]
*  this ceasefire is yet another moment where you should realize that the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=264.08s)]
*  Democratic party with the endless amount of, of pedigree that they had in terms [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=269.88s)]
*  of foreign policy just truly did not want to do this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=275.72s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=280.56s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=281.36s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=282.72s)]
*  All of the other stuff was just lies. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=283.6s)]
*  It was lies to, to keep up this, this veneer of, of interest in, in maintaining [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=286.72s)]
*  the international rule-based order or whatever, like the, they, they had a goal. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  They wanted to, they wanted his to be let loose in the region and they let it happen. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=299.6s)]
*  And then they act in like, Oh man, we're just really trying to stop it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not that complicated. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=311.64s)]
*  Why BB supported Trump then he got played or more to come. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  I think there's more to come. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=315.64s)]
*  I think that's what it is. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=317.32s)]
*  I think Benjamin Ninny Yahoo also believes that Donald Trump will protect [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  him from additional legal scrutiny where he didn't feel like the, the liberals [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=324.2s)]
*  would do that for him, maybe. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=329.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=331.2s)]
*  But you have to understand. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=332.76s)]
*  This is not about Benjamin Netanyahu's wants, his political future, his goals. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=334.48s)]
*  He is not, he is not an autonomous party. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=339.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  He's not, he's not an autonomous party. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=346.0s)]
*  He's not a party that has any agency in this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=348.24s)]
*  He is merely a vessel of American empire. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=350.8s)]
*  He's just the guy that you can yell at. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=354.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=357.64s)]
*  He's the punching bag and no, he's no longer insanely unpopular. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=359.12s)]
*  All the bloodshed made him very popular in his again. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=363.84s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=366.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=367.68s)]
*  I said time and time again, that all Biden needed to do was make a phone [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=367.84s)]
*  call, the right phone call. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=375.32s)]
*  A phone call where he says it's done and he never made that phone call. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=375.68s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=380.12s)]
*  Now this is a lot more complicated with Iran. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=380.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=385.64s)]
*  This is actually a complicated process. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=386.96s)]
*  It's a complicated process because it requires not American interest, but it [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=389.8s)]
*  requires like the American design in the region to be tweaked potentially. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=394.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=399.2s)]
*  Because now you're not dealing with a foreign ally that will just do whatever [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  you want them to do. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=404.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=406.04s)]
*  Now you're dealing with a foreign adversary that is a major threat as a [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=406.72s)]
*  state, as a functioning state, potentially a nuclear state that is an enemy to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=412.16s)]
*  your designs in the region and an enemy to your major power player allies in the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=418.12s)]
*  region, Saudi Arabia and okay. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=423.16s)]
*  Remember three months ago, you were watching that Ozzity Zio pig YouTuber [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  cast me a report video gloating over the genocidal generals plan and the annexation [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=429.04s)]
*  of North Gaza and three months after they withdrew from North Gaza. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=432.12s)]
*  Look, I'm not saying their designs for Gaza is over. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=436.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm not saying Israel's interest in Gaza is done. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=440.68s)]
*  It's diminished. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  I think that there is, I think that there is still the West bank in play. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=444.12s)]
*  I don't like to speculate, but could you project six months ahead or so? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=448.84s)]
*  Because one of the key pieces of the deal is I understand it from friends who [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=452.28s)]
*  are very supportive of the Israelis that in a way it was a terrible deal, but one [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=456.0s)]
*  that they should take because of the situation that they found themselves in. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=460.44s)]
*  And, but the key was they not have to declare an end to the war. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  Not have to declare an end to the war. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=470.88s)]
*  President Trump, if you could play this, this is call for number one. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  He says he's not confident it will hold. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=477.92s)]
*  How confident are you Mr. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=479.44s)]
*  President that you can keep this cease fire in Gaza and conclude the three phases of the deal? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=480.8s)]
*  I'm not confident. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=486.24s)]
*  That's not our war. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=487.0s)]
*  It's their war, but I'm not confident, but I think they're very weakened on the other side. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=487.76000000000005s)]
*  Gaza, where I looked at a picture of Gaza, Gaza is like a massive demolition site. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=494.64000000000004s)]
*  That place is, it's really got to be rebuilt in a different way. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=500.32s)]
*  How do you characterize whether the cease fire will hold? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=507.44s)]
*  Well, I don't disagree with the president. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=512.8s)]
*  I think that the implementation Dana of it is probably more difficult than [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=514.76s)]
*  the execution of the, of the deal. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=520.6s)]
*  The execution, that was a big step. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=522.88s)]
*  It, that was the condition precedent. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=524.64s)]
*  We had to get it done and we did. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=526.88s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=529.28s)]
*  And now we've got to implement. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm actually going to be going over to, I'm going to be a part of an inspection team at the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=532.0s)]
*  net also at the Philadelphia corridor. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=539.32s)]
*  That's where you have, outside, overseers, sort of, making sure that people are safe and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=542.0s)]
*  people who are entering are not armed and no one has bad motivations. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=553.08s)]
*  But we have to make sure that the implementation goes well, because if it goes well, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=557.48s)]
*  we'll get into phase two and we're going to get a lot more live bodies out. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  And I think that that is what the president's directive to me and everybody else working in [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=566.48s)]
*  the American government on this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  That's his directive and that's what we're going to do. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=574.12s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  Our audience may not be that familiar with you, but they're going to get to know you very [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=577.84s)]
*  soon. And we really appreciate you coming on today because these are very important issues. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=582.24s)]
*  Your relationship with Donald Trump appears to me to be forged over the years and you've [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=586.6800000000001s)]
*  known each other for a long time through New York real estate and the game of golf. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=590.4000000000001s)]
*  Off and you were with them in Palm Beach the day that second assassination attempt took [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=595.12s)]
*  place. So you guys know where each other's coming from on just about everything with [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=599.2s)]
*  regard to the future in the Middle East. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  Do you see soon a handshake deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia that gets that peace deal [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=605.6s)]
*  back on track with that would then pull in other Arab countries in the region? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=613.36s)]
*  Well, you know, Bill, it's. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=621.04s)]
*  It's it's been out in the news that there's been there's been talk of a normalization [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=624.6800000000001s)]
*  deal, and I think that normalization is an amazing opportunity for the region. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=629.72s)]
*  It's it's basically the beginning of the end of war and the beginning of the end of war [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=635.12s)]
*  means that the entire region becomes investible. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=640.08s)]
*  It becomes financeable. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=643.72s)]
*  Banks do not have to underwrite whether the hoodies Hezbollah or Hamas is going to fire [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=645.72s)]
*  a missile and take down. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  The hyperscale data center. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=654.88s)]
*  So I think that normalization is huge for the state of Israel. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=656.72s)]
*  It's huge for the region. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=660.0s)]
*  And hopefully it happens. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=661.48s)]
*  And my own opinion is that a condition precedent to normalization was a ceasefire. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=663.36s)]
*  We needed to get people believing again. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=670.24s)]
*  First, we needed the hopeful moment. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=673.72s)]
*  And I and I'd like to think that we've achieved that and will build on that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=675.2800000000001s)]
*  And then on top of that, we needed to show. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=679.6800000000001s)]
*  People that we could stop the the the the the, you know, the violence and we could have [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=683.96s)]
*  conversation and dialogue. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=692.24s)]
*  And so this is the beginning of that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=694.12s)]
*  And hopefully everything over there can be settled in that way. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=696.2s)]
*  If possible, everyone will become a believer. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=698.92s)]
*  Just one more one more from me. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=701.68s)]
*  How many countries you think could be on board? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=703.76s)]
*  I think you could get everybody on board in that region. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=708.76s)]
*  I really do. I think there's a new sense of leadership over there. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=711.28s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. I mean, Qatar, look at look at what Qatar was enormously helpful in this [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=715.9599999999999s)]
*  Sheikh Mohammed. He did he did plenty of, you know, his communication skills with Hamas [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=720.5999999999999s)]
*  were were indispensable here. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=727.28s)]
*  So I think the UAE is already a part of it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  Egypt was what it was was very, very helpful to us in this in these endeavors. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=734.72s)]
*  I think we can we have the opportunity to get everybody bought in to a better future [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=740.8s)]
*  for the region. More opportunity, more hope. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=747.52s)]
*  I think we have that this is an inflection point. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=750.12s)]
*  Steve, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=754.28s)]

*  Thank you. Yes. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=760.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's OK. OK, thank you. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=762.6s)]
*  But I had to order mushy mushy. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=766.44s)]
*  I had to order water and a bunch of stuff. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=769.08s)]
*  How's the jet lag? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=772.16s)]
*  Non-existent so far, but see the day is still very, very young. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=773.24s)]
*  As you know, it's 4 p.m. over there, but over here it's only 9 a.m. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=777.44s)]
*  So I just got started. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=782.08s)]
*  OK, so a couple of points here that are important. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=783.44s)]
*  OK, number one drop site is covering this. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=788.36s)]
*  It says in an interview with Fox News, Witkoff also announced he would travel to Gaza to be [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=792.0s)]
*  a part of the inspection team to ensure compliance with the deal. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=795.44s)]
*  He said he wants the implementation to go well, as President Trump special. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=798.7600000000001s)]
*  He said he wants the implementation to go well. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=801.8000000000001s)]
*  If it goes well, they're going to phase two and we're going to get a lot more live bodies out. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=803.5200000000001s)]
*  And I think that's what the president's directive to me and everybody else working [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=807.1600000000001s)]
*  the American government on in this is I'm actually going to go to Israel. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=809.92s)]
*  I'm going to be part of the inspection team at the Nansim corridor and also part of the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=814.36s)]
*  Philadelphia corridor. Said Senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzouk's [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=817.08s)]

*  Emphasize Qatar's leadership in the broader normalization process and its crucial role in [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=825.52s)]
*  the peace efforts. Witkoff said he believed a long elusive normalization deal with Saudi [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=829.28s)]
*  Arabia could be reached. He went further saying he believed every country in the region could [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=833.64s)]
*  get on board with such a deal. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=836.48s)]
*  Normalization means the beginning of the end of the war means the entire region becomes [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=838.08s)]
*  investable, becomes financeable. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=840.84s)]
*  Classic real estate guy, classic real estate speak. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=842.92s)]
*  My own opinion is that the conditional precedent to normalization was a ceasefire. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=846.4s)]
*  We need to get people believing again. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=849.88s)]
*  And this was not met with a lot of positive opinions. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=851.68s)]
*  In the minds of a lot of pro-Israeli speakers in the United States of America, a lot of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=858.88s)]
*  people were very, very frustrated, especially because he said that he was interested in [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=864.28s)]
*  talking to Hamas directly. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=870.4s)]
*  OK, not through shuttle diplomacy, but directly potentially. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  That was a big deal. They got very mad at that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=876.16s)]
*  Now they're calling him a calling him a Qatari agent, especially because he once again [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=878.48s)]
*  glazed the Amir. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=885.64s)]
*  And also, I think he's like done dealings with Qatar in the past as well. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=887.88s)]
*  So people are very, very upset about this. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=892.52s)]
*  Yeah. Mr. Anti-Zionist over here. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3h7MliGhMc&t=897.72s)]
