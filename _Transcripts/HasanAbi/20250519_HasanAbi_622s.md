# Trump Bans DEEPFAKES? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc)
*  Oh my god, Blue Anon. Oh my god, Blue Anon is so brainbroken, dude. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=0.0s)]
*  Blue Anon is looking at a bill that AOC also authored or co-sponsored and saying, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=5.94s)]
*  like, no, this actually is for some other nefarious purpose. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=14.24s)]
*  And the nefarious purpose is that Trump's feelings are hurt by this A- [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=19.36s)]
*  This is a way for them to drive home that narrative directly at odds with [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=22.54s)]
*  mainstream media. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is doing what? Donald Trump is releasing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=36.12s)]
*  his new internet law. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=41.82s)]
*  That wasn't good. I don't know if that was good. I'm okay with it. I'm okay. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=43.82s)]
*  I also want to congratulate- [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=49.1s)]
*  Do we have a different link? Because this link is ass. Like the captions, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=50.62s)]
*  auto captions are busted. Some are saying the cancer itself wasn't an accident. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=55.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. I love this one. Lots of good theories online. Biden's dementia and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=60.58s)]
*  cancer sounds like Havana syndrome. Is it an assassination? Did U S intelligence [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=64.02s)]
*  or whoever was controlling the auto pen want the president cognitively impaired [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=68.5s)]
*  and do they now want him dead? That's right. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=72.7s)]
*  ...federal law to combat the distribution of explicit imaginary posted without [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=75.98s)]
*  subjects consent. This is a good thing, by the way, that he's doing pictures and I [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=83.62s)]
*  guess sometimes even make up the pictures and they post it without consent. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=88.62s)]
*  This is the anti-AI. This is the anti-AI legislation generated by artificial [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=91.98s)]
*  intelligence known as deepfakes. We've all heard about deepfakes. I have all the time, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  but I don't know. Nobody does anything. I asked Pam, can you help me? Pam, she says- [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=101.54s)]
*  It's kind of weird though because he has used deepfakes before. Like not deepfake, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=105.54s)]
*  but he has literally used like deepfake AI shit in the past to smear opponents. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=109.26s)]
*  ...the rise of AI image generation countless women. I guess sometimes even make up the pictures [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=113.62s)]
*  and they post it without consent or anything else. And very importantly, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  this includes for forgeries generated by artificial intelligence known as deepfakes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  We've all heard about deepfakes. I have all the time, but I don't know. Nobody does anything. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=128.22s)]
*  I asked Pam, can you help me? Pam, she says, no, I'm too busy. Too busy doing other things. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=131.62s)]
*  ...you'll survive, but a lot of people don't survive. That's true and so horrible. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=134.26s)]
*  With the rise of AI image generation, countless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=137.45999999999998s)]
*  explicit images distributed against their will. This is the wrong and it's just so horribly wrong. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=140.42s)]
*  And it's a very abusive situation like in some cases- [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=144.82s)]
*  Okay, this leads me to believe that we've- that Trump has seen the deepfake videos of him sucking Elon's toes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=147.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  Upon hearing the stories of so many women affected, our First Lady made stopping these abuses a top [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=157.94s)]
*  priority and she was given tremendous support because people- she'd go up to people and talk [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=163.94s)]
*  about it. They say, yeah, we know about it. We have the problem because we do something. And she [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=168.1s)]
*  did something about it with the help of a lot of the people, especially the political people- [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=171.46s)]
*  For the record, I call balls and strikes. This is good. This is good that the admin didn't get in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=176.34s)]
*  the way of this. I believe there was some contest from the likes of perverts such as Elon Musk, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=181.06s)]
*  because he's like Mr. AI now, even though he hated AI in the beginning. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=187.46s)]
*  Let me see. I might be wrong on this. Let's see. I mean, he has a Musk's ex to block [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=191.14s)]
*  Minnesota deepfake law over free speech concerns. But this is, you know, Congress passes take it down [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=200.1s)]
*  act despite major flaws from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. There's always going to be [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=212.82s)]
*  issues with this kind of legislation, by the way. President Trump himself said that he would [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=217.54s)]
*  use a lot of censor his critics. The bill passed the Senate in February. That's a take down [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=224.42s)]
*  provision and take it down applies to a much broader category of content, potentially any [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=228.82s)]
*  images involving intimate or content than the narrower NCI definitions found elsewhere in the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=232.26s)]
*  bill. The take down provision also lacks critical safeguards against frivolous or bad faith take [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=238.26s)]
*  down requests. Services rely on automated filters, which are infamously blunt tools. They frequently [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=241.78s)]
*  flag legal content from fair use commentary to news reporting. The laws type timeframe requires [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=246.9s)]
*  the apps and websites remove speech for 1048 hours, rarely enough time to verify whether the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=252.26000000000002s)]
*  speech is actually illegal. As a result, online service providers, particularly smaller ones, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=256.18s)]
*  will likely choose to avoid the owner's legal risk by simply de publishing the speech rather [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=260.1s)]
*  than attempt to verify it. So I think that there is there are definitely issues with this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=264.5s)]
*  But there's always going to be issues. Bad take it's bad law that's too ambiguous. And we'll [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=271.22s)]
*  push for preemptive take down for even verifying the content. But I think that given given how [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=276.74s)]
*  aggressive people will try to misuse the take down notices here, I assume that they will like, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=283.38s)]
*  it will be up to the private corporations to to issue better protections towards false take down [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=291.22s)]
*  notices and to build better verification tools. People talk about all sorts of first amendment, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=296.58s)]
*  second amendment they talked about any any amendment. The reality of the matter is deep [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=302.42s)]
*  fake AI is truly a horrible, horrible thing that is incredibly commonplace. And I think ultimately, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=306.66s)]
*  any kind of any kind of of legal, any kind of like legal protection for victims in this process is [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=315.54s)]
*  always going to be seen as like, expansive, vague, could be used towards quelling speech. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=323.22s)]
*  It's the same principle behind like nets DG, for example. Having said that, I still think it's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=330.02s)]
*  Is this the market will regulate itself? Well, there's no other way around it. This just how it [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=338.26s)]
*  is. You have too much faith in the shitty corpos to not do a good job. They will fumble it hard. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=342.66s)]
*  And this will be a censorship tool. I understand that. But I think it's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=347.38s)]
*  it's um, I think ultimately, it's a it's a good bill. I mean, it's not the best bill. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=353.94s)]
*  But I think it's still it can be used nefariously. But every kind of every bill that that tries to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  curb back malicious actors is always going to be weaponized by other malicious actors [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=368.9s)]
*  with false flagging. But thank you very much for being here. All of you and congressmen, a lot of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=373.78s)]
*  women. Working with our first lady, though, we've shown that that bipartisanship is possible. I [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=379.94s)]
*  mean, it's the first time I've seen such a level of bipartisanship, and it's a beautiful thing to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=386.42s)]
*  do. I'm not even sure you realize, honey, you know, a lot of the Democrats and Republicans don't get [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  along so well. You've you've made them get along and she didn't even know about that. She didn't [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=397.78000000000003s)]
*  know we had a problem. She didn't know we had a problem. She got, but I want to thank you, honey. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=402.66s)]
*  You've done amazing that this was done when you started and I said, I don't know, it sounds like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=408.26s)]
*  a tough one and yet a very important one. And you got it done. So I congratulate you and I congratulate [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=413.06s)]
*  Ted Maria, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. And we'll sign the bill. Thank you. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=418.58s)]
*  So condescending. I mean, that's Trump, baby. That's how he is. So, yeah, I don't think it's a I [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=424.42s)]
*  don't think it's the end of the world. Obviously, any kind of bill. I mean, you can say this about [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=430.82s)]
*  everything. Every kind of legislation, good or bad, can be misused. OK. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=435.46s)]
*  Breaking Trump wants to ban this video showing Melania Trump making out with Gavin Newsom. Trump [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=441.14s)]
*  insiders told us Trump is disgusted by this video and wants to ban off the Internet. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=446.18s)]
*  Oh, my God. Blue and on. Oh, my God. Blue and on is so brain broken, dude. Blue and on [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  is looking at a bill that like AOC also authored or co-sponsored and saying like, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=459.06s)]
*  no, this actually is for this actually is for some other nefarious purpose. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=464.98s)]
*  And the nefarious purpose is that Trump's feelings are hurt by this video. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  I think they are memeing, but I might be wrong. I don't think they're joking. I think they're being [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=480.58000000000004s)]
*  sincere. I think it's like a it's like almost like a Midas touch angle here, which is that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=485.62s)]
*  the biggest anti Internet laws always use topic everyone agrees with to be like, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=491.46s)]
*  how can you be against this to ship horrible things into law? I agree. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=495.46s)]
*  Says the Foss is a great example of this as well, where they act like they're trying to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=498.82s)]
*  combat trafficking. Many work provisions, many work laws are positioned as like being against [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=503.38s)]
*  trafficking and being against like other forms of non-consensual acts being filmed when in fact, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=510.97999999999996s)]
*  the actual impact of legislation such as that is to make it harder to do work in general in [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=518.34s)]
*  a consensual manner. And says the Foss is a great example of this that was horrible for workers [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=524.34s)]
*  and took away tools that they could use to protect themselves from clients that were bad. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=530.1s)]
*  For example, I know this I've talked about this extensively. I still think that this on the other [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=536.26s)]
*  hand, is not like the primary purpose of this is not necessarily to to quell speech or to issue [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=542.1s)]
*  takedowns falsely, it will be used for that purpose. But the primary purpose of this legislation is to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=550.34s)]
*  combat deep fake AI. I like Do you see what I mean? Like says the FOSTA, its primary purpose wasn't [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=557.0600000000001s)]
*  to combat trafficking, it was just presented as that. But in fact, it was actually to make it [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=563.0600000000001s)]
*  harder to do work to move away from decriminalizing work and to move in the direction of further [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=567.38s)]
*  criminalizing work make it harder to do. The primary purpose of this legislation on the other [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=574.02s)]
*  hand, while it still allows opportunities for bad faith actors to falsely to falsely apply [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=578.5s)]
*  this take it down act to try to get shit taken down and to to try to stop free speech from [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=588.58s)]
*  taking place online. The primary purpose of the bill in and of itself is still to combat deep fake [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=594.58s)]
*  AI. And therefore I think it's it's not the worst. Anyway, speaking of JD Vance, a man who doesn't [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=600.6600000000001s)]
*  have it. I mean, let's get back to JD Vance talking about Biden's health in office and the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=607.62s)]
*  prostate cancer stuff that took place. Let's take a look. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHTjZinmXc&t=614.6600000000001s)]
