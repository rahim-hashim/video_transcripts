*  Do you have a strategy [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=180.04s)]
*  Yes, and no, so I've done one of these episodes before but it was very different [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=182.68s)]
*  We had a rank and see if they were gay or not [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=187.16s)]
*  It was only based on physical and this time we have a little bit more [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=188.88s)]

*  I think I can get a little more depth, but I'm not very confident here [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=202.76s)]
*  I would say I would love to be number two and I feel like the Queen over here should be number one [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=206.0s)]
*  But you guys are setting up [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=211.18s)]

*  Yeah, yeah [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=227.78s)]
*  So I was ranked the least so I feel like I can only go up so I'm feeling kind of confident [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=229.68s)]
*  I don't know if I'm gonna be wrong. You know, I don't know if I'm gonna be like Biden like [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=234.88s)]
*  75% [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=241.12s)]
*  You know what? I mean, I don't know [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  But we better find out that you shouldn't pull out the impression [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  This is a long line [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=249.44s)]
*  So many people [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=252.0s)]
*  What's up y'all? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=253.56s)]
*  Okay, like I wouldn't do it first guy do a Biden impression cuz I can't do one [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=255.92s)]
*  You know, the first guy's native [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=259.56s)]

*  It wasn't that I want my kids like that actually made me think she was a liberal because she was like oh my kids agree with me [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=3882.46s)]
*  But I don't care if they don't that's made me that's what made me think she was definitely a liberal [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=3887.98s)]
*  But then the guy asked the car take and she was like, I don't want a freebie. I was like, oh dude, okay, that's like [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=3892.94s)]
*  conservative [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=3899.2400000000002s)]

*  Earnings or whatever that made me think she was republican [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=3965.58s)]
*  So you guessed that I was a democrat you also guessed that I was democrat and you went republican I am registered with the republican party [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze4I1m1BSUs&t=3972.46s)]
