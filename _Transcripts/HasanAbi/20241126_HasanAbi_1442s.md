# Walmart U.S. CEO On DEI Programs, Trump's Proposed Tariffs | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE)
*  Under pressure from a conservative activist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=0.0s)]
*  So a few of the changes here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=2.4s)]
*  Like, I hate that this is the peak of activism in America, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=3.94s)]
*  is like always centered around consumption. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=7.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=12.08s)]
*  Walmart puts out like, I don't know, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=13.06s)]
*  t-shirts or something. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=15.42s)]
*  And then they're like, oh, I'm so sorry. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=16.68s)]
*  We're gonna take away the t-shirts. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=18.22s)]
*  Like, was the initial act even all that significant [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=20.16s)]
*  in terms of progress? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=24.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=26.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=27.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=28.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=29.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=29.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=30.7s)]
*  Morning, a major decision at Walmart. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=31.52s)]
*  Not about holiday sales, but about diversity programs, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=33.6s)]
*  also known as DEI programs. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=36.96s)]
*  It's joining a growing list of companies, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=39.0s)]
*  rolling them back. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=41.22s)]
*  This morning, the world's largest retailer says [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=42.92s)]
*  it's rolling back some of its diversity, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=45.68s)]
*  equity and inclusion policies. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=48.04s)]
*  Walmart, which employs more than 1 1 1⁄2 million Americans [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  joins a list of major corporations, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=53.36s)]
*  revising DEI initiatives. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=55.68s)]
*  The company saying every decision comes from a place [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=57.92s)]
*  of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=61.08s)]
*  to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=63.32s)]
*  customers and suppliers. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=66.28s)]
*  This is the single largest employer in the United States. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=68.04s)]
*  We are talking about a company that is worth almost. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=70.92s)]
*  This guy getting play is so gross. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=73.4s)]
*  Robbie Starbuck. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=76.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's real, man. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=78.22s)]
*  This is really what happened. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=79.2s)]
*  I can't believe his b*****g is like a prominent, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=80.56s)]
*  he is a prominent figure in the Republican movement. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=82.7s)]
*  And it reminds me of this other prominent figure [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=86.94s)]
*  in the Republican movement. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=88.74000000000001s)]
*  Scott Pressler, baby, who called the CNN piece a hit piece. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=93.94s)]
*  Those are the words of a man few people know, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  but a man who was key to Donald Trump's win in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  The controversial conservative activist, Scott Pressler, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  He looks exactly like the other guy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  Involved in the group Gays for Trump, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  a vocal election denier. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=110.14s)]
*  I used to hate you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=112.26s)]
*  The more content viewers I saw, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  the more I saw you had reasonable takes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=114.06s)]
*  and the impression I've been giving of you was incorrect. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=115.58000000000001s)]
*  Keep being amazing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  Ellie, I chatter. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad that you were able to watch this content [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=119.58000000000001s)]
*  charitably. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=121.9s)]
*  It was by the Twitter handle, the persistence. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  He helped deliver that all important must win state [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  In large part by focusing on, as he says, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=128.8s)]
*  the Amish, frat guys and hunters, among other groups. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=131.52s)]
*  And Pressler, as our Ellie Reeve reports, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=135.9s)]
*  is just getting started. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=138.26s)]
*  Everybody just big smile and look cute. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=139.74s)]
*  Cheese. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=143.82000000000002s)]
*  Cheese. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=144.66s)]
*  Scott Pressler is the kind of political figure [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=146.54000000000002s)]
*  only possible in the Trump era. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=148.74s)]
*  Going from social media influencer [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=150.9s)]
*  to actual proximity to power. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=152.70000000000002s)]
*  Scott, Scott, Scott. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=154.5s)]
*  Pressler is taking credit for turning Pennsylvania red. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=156.58s)]
*  He created a pack, Early Vote Action, to register voters. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=159.58s)]
*  Is there a reason the biggest critique I always hear [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=163.38s)]
*  about you from mostly same people is that you cherry pick? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=165.22s)]
*  Cherry pick what? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=167.86s)]
*  Are the criticisms, I don't know who you're talking about [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=169.78s)]
*  in terms of like mostly same people, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=172.38s)]
*  but are the criticisms just that you're a cherry picker? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=174.98s)]
*  Are the criticisms valid or do they not actually stand [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=179.14s)]
*  on their own, especially when, you know, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=183.26s)]
*  oh, people you meet in real life, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=187.1s)]
*  yeah, they're probably watching clips, dude. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=188.46s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=190.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=191.66s)]
*  Why would that even be a problem [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=192.5s)]
*  from like a random person that you meet in your life? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=195.5s)]
*  You're like, hey, I really like this Hassan guy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=197.9s)]
*  I watch him and he's like, I hate that guy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=199.82000000000002s)]
*  because he cherry picks. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=201.46s)]
*  Honestly, this is more offensive [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=203.38000000000002s)]
*  than saying they're dying for nothing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=204.5s)]
*  Ukraine's are fighting and dying every day [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  so that we can be safe and enjoy the right to say [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  asinine ignorant and cowardly things on podcasts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=208.22000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=211.34s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just asking. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=212.18s)]
*  I mean, you should ask them what they mean [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=213.34s)]
*  when they say cherry picker. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  I've never actually heard anybody say that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  I wish someone could, you know, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=219.74s)]
*  give an example of what they mean. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=221.06s)]
*  But if I'm being super charitable, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=223.10000000000002s)]
*  I assume they mean like, oh, he actually will address [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=225.5s)]
*  like the worst criticism that someone has made [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=230.02s)]
*  and not address like the reasonable criticisms [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=233.26s)]
*  that people are making. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=235.66s)]
*  But the problem is they're not making reasonable criticisms. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=236.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=239.86s)]
*  The one consistent through line [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=241.02s)]
*  with a lot of people who hate me [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=242.62s)]
*  that most likely agree with a lot of what I talk about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=245.14s)]
*  is that they've probably seen some clips [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=249.98s)]
*  and the clips that they saw left a sour taste [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=252.42s)]
*  in their mouth and understandably they're busy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=256.41999999999996s)]
*  So they're not gonna examine further. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=259.86s)]
*  They're not gonna go to the root cause. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=262.38s)]
*  They're not gonna like make up their own mind. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  Many people do this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=266.34s)]
*  I am sure have been victim to this as well [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=267.21999999999997s)]
*  about other people, random people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=270.0s)]
*  And they just operate off of vibes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=271.84s)]
*  And sometimes they'll meet like, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  sometimes they'll see like a like a drama tube [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=276.02s)]
*  or slop content that they watched [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=278.58s)]
*  and make up their minds and move on. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=280.98s)]
*  And why should they? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  Why should they go further? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=284.82s)]
*  You know, it makes sense. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=286.62s)]
*  I also am very sarcastic usually. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=288.0s)]
*  So that I think like I have a sarcastic tone [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=289.94s)]
*  when I talk that I think people don't fully understand. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=293.74s)]
*  And if they're not aware of my convictions, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  if they're not aware of my worldview [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=299.94s)]
*  that leads people astray. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=301.98s)]
*  T-Pain thought I was a conservative for the longest time. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=303.38s)]
*  You know, I think I rely too much on how much commentary [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=305.86s)]
*  I've dedicated to being anti-Trump, anti-Republican, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=310.08s)]
*  anti-religious fundamentalism. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=314.28s)]
*  That like the expectation is that people will know [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=316.4s)]
*  especially if they find themselves in this community [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=319.12s)]
*  exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=321.15999999999997s)]

*  that are not in this community [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=324.52s)]
*  that are simply seeing clips out of context. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=326.56s)]
*  Now, of course, having said that, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=329.58s)]
*  your sarcasm doesn't track with people below the age of 27. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't agree with that either. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  You're just saying that because people below the age of 27 [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=335.96s)]
*  are mostly relying on clips. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=338.08s)]
*  They're not coming in here to watch. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=339.6s)]
*  They're not learning anything about my worldview [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=341.12s)]
*  and why should they? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  I totally understand it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=344.24s)]
*  And if your argument is, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=345.42s)]
*  if your argument is, you know, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  or if your solution is stop being sarcastic, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  well, you're stupid. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm not gonna stop doing commentary [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=352.70000000000005s)]
*  and trying to be entertaining in the way that I have [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=354.72s)]
*  developed my stream over, my stream around, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  just because people are maliciously dedicated [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  to framing me in a negative light. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=368.52s)]
*  And targeted the Amish, frat guys, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=371.64s)]
*  hunters, and other groups. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=374.0s)]
*  His pack got a $1 million donation from Elon Musk. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=375.84s)]
*  So walk us through how you do it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=379.35999999999996s)]
*  When I tell the Amish that they can vote [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  a private secret ballot that is mailed to their house [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=383.56s)]
*  and they don't have to have their buggies [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  seen going to a polling location, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=388.96s)]
*  they love the mail-in ballot. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=390.76s)]
*  But a lot of people sort of come up [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=392.12s)]
*  as social media influencers, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=393.64s)]
*  and then they fizzle out. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=395.44s)]
*  And you actually, you know, took the opportunity. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=396.52s)]
*  Yeah, he's fizzled out. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=399.44s)]
*  And started doing something quantifiable. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  He was at the Capitol on January 6th [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=403.68s)]
*  and at Trump's return to the scene [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=405.96s)]
*  of his near assassination in Butler. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=407.56s)]
*  President Trump took a bullet for us. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  Last week, Pressler was in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=414.24s)]
*  because of a controversy over what ballots [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=416.96s)]
*  would be counted in the Senate recount. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=419.12s)]
*  A frustrated county commissioner had said [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  some misdated and unsigned ballots would be counted [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=423.88s)]
*  despite the rules. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=426.76s)]
*  If I violate this law, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=428.36s)]
*  it's because I want a court to pay attention to it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=429.48s)]
*  This went very viral, in part because of Pressler. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=432.56s)]
*  She apologized at the next meeting. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=435.68s)]
*  The passion in my heart got the best of me, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=437.64s)]
*  and I apologize again for that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=439.92s)]
*  I made a mistake. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=441.8s)]
*  But by then, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=443.64s)]
*  had ruled those ballots wouldn't be counted. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=445.6s)]
*  Pressler and his fans had won. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=448.44s)]
*  Yet they turned out anyway, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=450.44s)]
*  and the room had a kind of intense vibe. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=452.04s)]
*  Do you think the 2020 election was stolen? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=454.12s)]
*  It definitely was stolen. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=458.04s)]
*  Okay, so can you explain something to me? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  Why, if they can steal an election, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=461.56s)]
*  why would they steal it once but not this year? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  Because people were too big to rig. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  Too big to rig. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=469.76s)]
*  On to them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=472.72s)]
*  The divisions and the Democrats made it very hard for them [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=473.48s)]
*  to try and steal it again. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you to every single patriot that showed up today. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=477.92s)]
*  We did it! [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=481.32s)]
*  I think what you heard today is the frustration of people. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=483.44s)]
*  I think there's something really off about the way [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=487.92s)]
*  that every Trump influencer carries themselves to. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=489.71999999999997s)]
*  It's just like fucking weird. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=493.92s)]
*  People that have been told- [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=496.24s)]
*  They're so gross! [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  They are election deniers, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=499.24s)]
*  and here we have a sitting commissioner [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=500.68s)]
*  that's an election denier, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=502.2s)]
*  and we have a currently sitting senator, Bob Casey, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=503.32s)]
*  that is also an election denier, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  and it's almost karmic. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=507.6s)]
*  And yes, that's why in part we were here [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=509.52s)]
*  to take a victory lap. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=511.24s)]
*  We won, and we did it fair and square. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=512.64s)]
*  If we take that commissioner's words [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  in the worst possible light, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=516.92s)]
*  let's say she truly meant rules don't apply [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=518.64s)]
*  and she could count ballots that shouldn't be counted. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  She still failed to steal the election, right? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  Like, you guys still won Pennsylvania and Bucks County. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=527.6s)]
*  So help me reconcile that with your past, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=531.56s)]
*  with the Stop the Steal movement in 2020. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=535.48s)]
*  Like, why could it have been stolen once, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=537.68s)]
*  but not a second time? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=539.28s)]
*  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  If we let them get away with doing this now, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=544.92s)]
*  they'll do it in 2026, they'll do it in 2028. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=547.76s)]
*  This was us peacefully putting our feet down and saying, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=550.48s)]
*  no, enough is enough, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=554.24s)]
*  and we're not going to allow you to do [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=555.48s)]
*  illegal and unlawful actions. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=557.28s)]
*  And we're gonna hold you accountable. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  Cheese. Ready? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=560.92s)]
*  One, two, three. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=561.76s)]
*  Cheese. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=563.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  I noticed that when you urge people to action, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=564.68s)]
*  you often include the word- [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=566.64s)]
*  Peacefully. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=569.24s)]
*  Is that to avoid another Jan 6th type incident? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=570.4000000000001s)]
*  With all due respect, it's to avoid people [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=573.6s)]
*  like you guys saying that I'm anything but. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=575.84s)]
*  My motto is to just be super cute, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=577.76s)]
*  have my data and facts, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=580.6800000000001s)]
*  treat everyone with love and respect, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=582.44s)]
*  and as you can see, an army of people will follow. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=584.4000000000001s)]
*  And it was a small army, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=587.24s)]
*  which included followers of a Korean church [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=588.88s)]
*  led by rapper King Bullethead. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=591.08s)]
*  Oh my God, it's the fucking AR-15-er, dude. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=593.6400000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=599.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, American transgressions in Korea [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=600.68s)]
*  have looped itself back to the United States of America. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=603.64s)]
*  Oh my God, this fucking cult. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=607.04s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=609.36s)]
*  Oh, the payoff, the payoff is endless, okay? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=611.24s)]
*  We gotta go back to neo-cultivationism [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  for you to fully comprehend what's going on here. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=617.56s)]
*  Cult leader vibes out the tribes. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=620.08s)]
*  No, he is literally a cult leader. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=621.52s)]
*  This is the cult, the Moonies. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=623.28s)]
*  This is the Moonies offshoot that like fucks their AR-15s, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=625.72s)]
*  like they marry their guns, dude. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=629.6s)]
*  So when you were up there speaking, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  it almost seemed like you were taking a bit of a victory lap [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  for turning Pennsylvania and this county red. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=636.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=638.08s)]
*  A lot of people questioned our- [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=638.9200000000001s)]
*  All because these Americans sailed up the Han River [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=640.84s)]
*  and forced Korea to trade. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=643.16s)]
*  Go to registration. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=645.24s)]
*  They said, Scott, you know, flipping Bucks County [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=646.64s)]
*  to a plurality of registered Republicans, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=648.9200000000001s)]
*  that's not gonna translate into results. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=651.0s)]
*  And yes, a little bit of the victory lot was here to say [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=653.36s)]
*  that for the first time since 1988, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=656.82s)]
*  we flipped this county and it voted for President Trump. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=659.1s)]
*  It's kind of, you know, saying to people, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=661.7800000000001s)]
*  no, we're the real deal. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=663.86s)]
*  Pressler first got attention in 2017 [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=665.34s)]
*  when he worked for an anti-Muslim group [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=667.58s)]
*  and organized marches against Sharia, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=669.34s)]
*  despite there being no Sharia law. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=671.34s)]
*  Organized marches against Sharia, thank God, dude. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=673.38s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=676.46s)]
*  I'm organizing marches against all the fucking elephants [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=677.5s)]
*  that are destroying my backyard. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=680.58s)]
*  Law in America. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=683.22s)]
*  He was also involved with Gays for Trump. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=684.6999999999999s)]
*  You described yourself as a data guy. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=687.02s)]
*  Yes. But early in your career, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=689.4599999999999s)]
*  you were more of kind of like a social issues, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=690.6999999999999s)]
*  culture war guy, like Gays for Trump or Act for America. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=692.9s)]
*  Can you tell me about that shift in your career? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=696.6999999999999s)]
*  I have grown in how I approach politics. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=698.86s)]
*  I see my work and my evolution in politics [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=704.6999999999999s)]
*  as a later foundation, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=708.62s)]
*  and now I am meticulously building on that [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=710.18s)]
*  and esoteric understanding of how politics [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=713.26s)]
*  is going to win elections, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=716.3s)]
*  focusing on demographic groups, get them registered, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=717.9399999999999s)]
*  get them mobilized, get them out to vote. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=720.86s)]
*  Twice, RNC officials have indicated they would hire him, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=723.14s)]
*  but it hasn't worked out. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=726.46s)]
*  Still, he's built a loyal fan base. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=728.18s)]
*  Have you spoken to President Trump since the election? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=730.46s)]
*  I've spoken to Laura Trump. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=734.46s)]
*  What'd she say? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=736.18s)]
*  Our conversations out of respect to her [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=737.1s)]
*  and the Trump family are private, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=738.9s)]
*  but she was congratulatory. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=740.14s)]
*  And what about Elon Musk? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=741.58s)]
*  I think he's a wonderful human being. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=743.5s)]
*  Have you talked to him since the election? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=745.22s)]
*  We've messaged, nothing consequential. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=747.02s)]
*  God save America, hallelujah. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=749.66s)]
*  Tonight- [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=752.54s)]
*  It's not a hit piece, it's just a piece. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=753.38s)]
*  I appreciated talking to us [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=754.34s)]
*  and I think we had a good conversation. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=755.38s)]
*  Why are, I don't get why like they're, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=757.54s)]
*  why, like it literally was somewhat of a puff piece. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=760.82s)]
*  Why is he fucking mad? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=764.7s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=766.1s)]
*  Just a trillion dollars on its own. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=767.94s)]
*  Robbie Starbuck, a political commentator, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=769.62s)]
*  an anti-DEI activist celebrated the development. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=771.74s)]
*  He's previously pressured companies, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=774.7s)]
*  including Lowe's and John Deere, to change their policies. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=776.5s)]
*  We were able to have frank conversations with Walmart. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=780.0200000000001s)]
*  And as I've said for a long time, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't ask companies to take on my political views. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=783.38s)]
*  I am simply advocating for corporate neutrality. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=785.98s)]
*  Walmart says many of the changes to its DEI programs [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=788.3000000000001s)]
*  were already planned and not a result [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=791.26s)]
*  of conversations with Starbuck. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=793.46s)]
*  The company is pledging to better monitor [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=795.1800000000001s)]
*  third-party marketplace items [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=797.3000000000001s)]
*  to make sure they don't feature [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=798.98s)]
*  sexual and transgender products aimed at minors. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=800.42s)]
*  Walmart says it will also review its funding to pride events [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=803.38s)]
*  and will end racial equity training programs for staff. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=806.78s)]
*  GLAAD, an LGBTQ advocacy group, has said, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=809.9s)]
*  We cannot let fear and fringe anti-LGBTQ activists [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=813.26s)]
*  dilute the work that has been done [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=817.26s)]
*  in the name of visibility, acceptance, and opportunity. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=818.82s)]
*  Companies need to listen to our movement. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=822.18s)]
*  We are powerful and growing every single day. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=823.98s)]
*  We will not stop until we have eliminated [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=826.22s)]
*  wokeness in corporate America. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=828.22s)]
*  Walmart also says it will no longer consider race and gender [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=829.6999999999999s)]
*  as a way to increase diversity [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=832.86s)]
*  when offering supplier contracts. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=834.5799999999999s)]
*  Walmart is a great American company [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  and the nation's largest retailer. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=838.9399999999999s)]
*  More than 1.6 million American employees alone [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=840.86s)]
*  and annual global revenue of nearly $650 billion. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=844.66s)]
*  My controversial opinion is that nothing is gonna change, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=849.26s)]
*  at least in this sector. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=852.14s)]
*  Hey, isn't this that guy that hates Palestinians? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=853.62s)]

*  Yeah, he is. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=858.18s)]
*  That's Tony Two-Tone. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=860.1s)]
*  Mr. Two-Time. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=861.34s)]
*  Doublesirk, Tony DeCoppel. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=863.02s)]
*  So, oh, speaking of Tony Doublesirk, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=864.98s)]
*  I'm gonna have Ta-Nehisi Coates on tomorrow on the broadcast. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=867.26s)]
*  I'll be interviewing him, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=872.78s)]
*  but that's neither him nor there. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=874.06s)]
*  I wanted to talk about this specifically. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=877.66s)]
*  They're taking shit off the shelves. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=881.22s)]
*  They did this shit. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=882.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the garbage-like LGBTQ branded product [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=883.54s)]
*  that like, that's not moving the needle. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=886.82s)]
*  It's already bullshit to begin with. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=890.34s)]
*  It's like, oh, on Pride Month, we're doing this. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=891.6600000000001s)]
*  Now, the response, the response is worse. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=894.38s)]
*  They just like put out that garbage shit [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=897.5s)]
*  and then only to take it away [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=900.1800000000001s)]
*  as though you are caving and capitulating [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=903.7800000000001s)]
*  to this like right-wing mob. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=906.02s)]
*  I think that that is not good. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=908.1800000000001s)]
*  It's infinitely better to just never have this [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=910.1800000000001s)]
*  to begin with, or if you're gonna have it, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=912.34s)]
*  then just don't fucking take it off the shelves. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=915.02s)]
*  It's a cell phone. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=918.5400000000001s)]
*  It's an own goal for no fucking reason whatsoever. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=919.4200000000001s)]
*  But in terms of like, oh, we're stopping our DEI initiatives [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=922.3000000000001s)]
*  or whatever the fuck like, I think, I don't know. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=924.9000000000001s)]
*  I don't think this is gonna change anything. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=929.14s)]
*  LGBT books are nice, man. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=930.9000000000001s)]
*  No, I'm not talking about that. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=932.26s)]
*  I'm talking about fucking like rainbow colored t-shirts [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=933.46s)]
*  or whatever the fuck. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=938.1s)]
*  But overall, I don't think that they're going to change [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=939.58s)]
*  their hiring practices dramatically. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=942.86s)]
*  They're just saying that they're moving away [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=945.6999999999999s)]
*  from DEI initiatives, whatever the fuck that means. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=948.0999999999999s)]
*  I don't think that that's a real, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=950.78s)]
*  I don't think that there is any sort of real change, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=952.0999999999999s)]
*  especially because a lot of the DEI practices [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=955.42s)]
*  was simply just like HR shit. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=957.5s)]
*  Like they're not gonna be like, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=960.3s)]
*  we're no longer hiring gay people. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=961.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=963.54s)]
*  I'm happy to say we're joined now [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=964.38s)]
*  for an exclusive interview with John Ferner, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=965.2199999999999s)]
*  the president and CEO of Walmart US. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=967.4599999999999s)]
*  John, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=970.66s)]
*  I wanna get into holiday shopping. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=972.62s)]
*  I wanna get into grocery prices, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=974.14s)]
*  but I gotta ask you off the top to talk about [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=975.54s)]
*  this report I'm reading in today's Wall Street Journal [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=977.78s)]
*  about how Walmart is pulling back on diversity, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=980.26s)]
*  equity and inclusion programs under pressure [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=983.74s)]
*  from a conservative activist. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=986.8199999999999s)]
*  So a few of the changes here. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=988.1s)]
*  Like I hate that this is the peak of activism in America [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=989.66s)]
*  is like always centered around consumption. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=992.6999999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=997.78s)]
*  Walmart puts out like, I don't know, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=998.78s)]
*  gay t-shirts or something. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1000.78s)]
*  And then they're like, oh, I'm so sorry. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1002.38s)]
*  We're gonna take away the gay t-shirts. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1003.9s)]
*  Like was the initial act even all that significant [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1005.86s)]
*  in terms of progress? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1009.98s)]
*  They're phasing out the term DEI, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1012.02s)]
*  winding down the Center for Racial Equity, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1014.86s)]
*  no longer giving priority treatment to suppliers [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1018.18s)]
*  based on race or gender diversity [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1021.42s)]
*  and preventing sellers from listing some transgender related [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1024.3s)]
*  or themed items on the website. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1027.94s)]
*  So does that accurate from what you're hearing [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1029.7s)]
*  and why the changes? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1031.58s)]
*  Well, first of all, good morning and thanks for having me. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1033.18s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1035.22s)]
*  I'm in Houston, Texas and our friends with location. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1036.0600000000002s)]
*  So it's exciting to be in the store this time of year. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1038.1000000000001s)]
*  First, let me say like many companies [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1041.14s)]
*  all across the United States, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1043.5s)]
*  we've been on a journey and we continue to be on. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1045.5400000000002s)]
*  The other part of this that I fear is like that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1047.5400000000002s)]
*  right-wing Republicans see this as a massive victory. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1051.14s)]
*  And so they'll move on to other more nefarious things [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1053.7s)]
*  that actually do end up harming gay people [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1056.8200000000002s)]
*  and trans people and shit like that. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1058.7800000000002s)]
*  And also outside of that, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1060.22s)]
*  this is seen as like giving the go ahead [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1062.82s)]
*  to open up the faucet of hatred [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1065.86s)]
*  against marginalized communities in general [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1069.06s)]
*  that like corporations are no longer even aesthetically [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1071.3s)]
*  in support of these marginalized groups. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1075.7s)]
*  A journey. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1078.3s)]
*  And what we're trying to do is to ensure [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1079.34s)]
*  that every customer, every associate feels welcome [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1081.46s)]
*  here to shop and to feel like they belong. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1085.18s)]
*  And that term belong, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1087.62s)]
*  we've been talking about belonging now [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1089.02s)]
*  for almost two years. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1091.02s)]
*  CEOs coming in, stack the product like pyramids. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1092.38s)]
*  Yeah, those are, that's looking great. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1095.9s)]
*  His background looks great. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1098.3400000000001s)]
*  Here's early 2023, we started talking about belonging. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1099.46s)]
*  And we're gonna continue to make the best decisions we can [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1102.94s)]
*  that makes everyone, our customers, our associates [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1106.1000000000001s)]
*  feel like this is an environment [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1108.98s)]
*  they can shop in and thrive in. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1110.1000000000001s)]
*  Is diversity among your suppliers [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1111.66s)]
*  still important to you at Walmart, John? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1113.66s)]
*  Well, starting with our company back in 1962, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1116.18s)]
*  we were a small business, a single store [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1119.3000000000002s)]
*  that operated out of Rogers, Arkansas. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1121.26s)]
*  And so we'll continue to do the things that we can do [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1123.58s)]
*  to ensure that small suppliers have a path [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1126.46s)]
*  to being successful, not only at Walmart, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1129.22s)]
*  but in their business in total. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1131.3s)]
*  Every year we really focus on made in the USA, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1132.58s)]
*  about two thirds of what we sell is either made, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1136.26s)]
*  grown or assembled right here in the United States. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1139.78s)]
*  We have a program every summer called Open Call [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1142.1s)]
*  where we welcome in small suppliers [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1144.58s)]
*  and we welcome in people that have an idea, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1147.02s)]
*  that are not sure who are and they wanna learn. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1148.98s)]
*  So we're gonna continue to lean into ensuring [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1150.42s)]
*  that we provide the very best pathways for small businesses, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1152.46s)]
*  our suppliers to be successful here in the store. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1156.3000000000002s)]
*  If I had more time, I could take you around the store [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1159.42s)]
*  and show you a few of those examples, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1161.0600000000002s)]
*  but there are a lot of them and they'll continue to be more. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1163.18s)]
*  All right, John, you mentioned that two thirds [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1165.78s)]
*  of what you have is made in the US. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1167.38s)]
*  Let's talk about that other third. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1168.8200000000002s)]
*  President-elect Trump announced last night [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1170.3400000000001s)]
*  that on his first day in office, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1172.3400000000001s)]
*  he will impose a 25% tariff on all products [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1173.78s)]
*  imported from Canada and Mexico. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1176.42s)]
*  So how will that impact? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1178.8200000000002s)]
*  What have y'all done to actually prepare for that? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1180.98s)]
*  Have you guys been stockpiling [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1183.7s)]
*  in anticipation of these tariffs? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1185.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, first, I'll just say again, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1187.74s)]
*  about two thirds of what we sell is made, grown or assembled [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1190.26s)]
*  here in the United States and we've been very supportive [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1192.6200000000001s)]
*  all the way back to our founder of products [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1194.5800000000002s)]
*  that are made in the United States. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1196.5s)]
*  Just a couple of days ago, someone sent me a photo [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1198.3000000000002s)]
*  of Mr. Walton, actually my father, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1200.1000000000001s)]
*  who worked at the company with the president of Lodge, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1201.66s)]
*  one of our brands here in the store in Camp and Cookware. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1204.18s)]
*  So we'll be ready to be adjusted. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1206.9s)]
*  We'll adjust to any environment. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1210.74s)]
*  We've been in an environment with tariffs now [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1211.5800000000002s)]
*  for the last seven years and we have a team of people [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1212.94s)]
*  that are really experienced and managed. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1215.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, these avocados you see behind me [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1217.7800000000002s)]
*  have been assembled in the United States [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1220.02s)]
*  in an American facility, okay? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1222.5s)]
*  Yes, it was picked in Mexico [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1225.22s)]
*  and shipped into the United States from Mexico, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1228.6200000000001s)]
*  but we assembled it here. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1231.8600000000001s)]
*  Changes in the environment. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1233.94s)]
*  Now our role, our purpose is to try to keep prices low, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1235.0600000000002s)]
*  to help people save money and enable them to live better. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1238.74s)]
*  Now, certainly there'll be some occasions. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1242.22s)]
*  Damn dude, Walmart seems dope. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1244.7s)]
*  When you hear the CEO say, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1246.78s)]
*  oh, our main purpose is not to farm American subsidies [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1248.06s)]
*  paid for by the tax dollars and heavily rely, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1252.9s)]
*  heavily rely on the welfare state [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1256.38s)]
*  in an effort to refuse to pay any of our workers [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1261.46s)]
*  an honest wage where me and my brothers and sisters [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1264.5s)]
*  own like what, 50% of shares of the company. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1268.78s)]
*  So every single day we edge closer and closer [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1272.26s)]
*  to being the wealthiest Americans. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1275.38s)]
*  And as a collective, we are the wealthiest family in America, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1276.98s)]
*  but hey, we care about you. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1281.3400000000001s)]
*  We don't care about that. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1282.42s)]
*  We care about making sure costs are low. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1284.02s)]
*  That's one of the craziest parts about the Walton family [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1286.9s)]
*  is that like you directly, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1288.8600000000001s)]
*  like Walmart shares directly enrich them, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1290.3s)]
*  like seven people, okay? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1293.98s)]
*  When they make moves, seven total people are getting [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1296.5s)]
*  like billions of fucking dollars directly in their pockets. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1299.5800000000002s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1302.3s)]
*  It's not, oh, this guy's not a Walton. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1303.3400000000001s)]
*  I thought maybe he was one of the Wal... [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1305.26s)]
*  I thought one of the CEOs was a Walton. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1306.7s)]
*  No, I guess not. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1308.38s)]
*  My bad. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1310.3400000000001s)]
*  He's just a high paid, is he not? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1311.18s)]
*  Wait, hold on, let's look. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1315.1000000000001s)]

*  He looks very different here. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1321.94s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTipfxJaYE&t=1323.26s)]
