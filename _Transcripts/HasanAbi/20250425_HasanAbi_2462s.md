# Trump Begged Putin | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc)
*  Oh yeah, no. A country that still believes that they have global superpower status, meanwhile, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=0.0s)]
*  has completely lost all of its influential role in the global stage. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=9.6s)]
*  Karell, no! Karell, no! That's what he did. Vladimir, stop! [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=14.96s)]
*  Now to President Trump and the war in Ukraine. As Russia escalates its attacks... [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=22.64s)]
*  Unjustifiably going after someone for appearing on Fortnite Friday. Really f***ed up stuff, folks. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  Trump pushed back but also embraced Russia's goals in peace talks. Senior political correspondent [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=38.8s)]
*  Rachel Scott is at the White House with the story. Good morning, Rachel. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=43.28s)]
*  George, good morning to you. And the president has made it clear he's not happy with Russia's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  aggression against Ukraine, but overnight they launched another strike as the fighting continues. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=50.56s)]
*  This morning in Moscow, Russian officials claiming a car bomb killed a high-ranking [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=56.72s)]
*  Russian military general. This surveillance video showing the moment a parked vehicle [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  explodes as a person walks toward it. Ukraine is not taking credit for the attack. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  It comes as Russia launches another drone strike across Ukraine. Just one day after targeting... [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=70.64s)]
*  Not gonna lie, it's kind of wild watching Ukrainians get so much better at doing clandestine [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=75.84s)]
*  operations and doing terror and then thinking about what a potential 9-11 might look like in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=81.84s)]
*  the future. Like we're basically, we're basically watching these dudes take it to Russia first, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=88.08s)]
*  okay? But inevitably there is going to come a time when they're, you know, when they turn the crosshairs [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=93.92s)]
*  on an administration that sold them down the line, potentially. Just saying. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=100.8s)]
*  I've seen this one before. Yeah, that's what I mean. This is like, this is not a movie. This is just [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=107.36s)]
*  look at American history. Frankly, that's what we wanted last time. We almost got it and then [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  they backed out of that deal. But we had it to go into China and sell our product, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=118.88s)]
*  sell our wares. In other words, it's called to open China. That would be great. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=126.4s)]
*  But I'm not even sure I'm going to ask for it because they don't want it open. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=132.4s)]
*  But because of tariffs, I could possibly get that. What do you think? Opening up China would be a big [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=142.0s)]
*  win, right? The problem is no matter how big the win is, the press will not give me credit for it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=147.28s)]
*  If I got the greatest win in history, if I got, they'll pay us trillions and trillions of dollars. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=153.04s)]
*  They'll give us anything we want. The press will say Trump, he just had a terrible defeat. He [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=160.64s)]
*  suffered a terrible defeat. But the people know. Now I think we're going to have a lot of big wins. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=167.76s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to be covered that way by the fake news, but the wins are going to be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=174.72s)]
*  very substantial. You know, we're losing. We were losing. We're fighting. Five billion a day. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=178.56s)]
*  So President Trump speaking to reporters there on Air Force One as he makes his way [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=188.4s)]
*  to Rome for the Pope's funeral. They're cutting them, dude. It's quite hard to hear him over the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=193.2s)]
*  roar of the engines of Air Force One. But when it came to that meeting between the US envoy [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=198.96s)]
*  Steve Wicoff and President Putin, he said discussions went well. It was a good [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=204.64s)]
*  meeting. He also spoke about tariffs of course and making very good tariffs. Not sure if you saw [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=209.92s)]
*  Trump was going mask up about how much he cares about jeans and what it means for greatness and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  it's really awkward. And he was asked if he was going to have any meetings on the sidelines of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  the funeral. He said frankly, it's a little disrespectful to have meetings when you're at [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  the funeral of the Pope. But he said, I'll be talking to people. I'll be seeing lots of people. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=229.68s)]
*  One person he doesn't expect to bump into though is former President Joe Biden. It's not high on [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=234.56s)]
*  my list. It's really not, he said. We'll keep across those comments for you. Bring you any updates [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=241.28s)]
*  throughout the evening. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. He's got a dude. This is, we don't, we don't talk about the Brandonization of Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=248.88s)]
*  enough, nearly enough on this broadcast. We really don't talk about it, but there is certainly a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=256.16s)]
*  Brandonization of Donald Trump that's taken place, especially in the second term where [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=262.16s)]
*  his like, I did NATO Jack stuff is even dumber. Someone in the chat actually made a really funny [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=268.24s)]
*  comparison that I hadn't even thought of. And I'm like, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=273.52s)]
*  make a really funny comparison that I hadn't even thought of, which is everything that Brandon went [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=276.48s)]
*  through with BB and Israel. Donald Trump is ironically going through with Vladimir Putin, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=281.76s)]
*  where he's like, no Vladimir Putin. If I wag my finger at you, you will stop. I know it because [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=290.0s)]
*  you trust me and I trust you. And it's even dumber because at least like with Israel, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, in some ways it's dumber and in some ways it's, I guess like more desperate, understandably, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=304.48s)]
*  because like you don't have the same level of control over your foreign adversary as you do [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  over Israel, right? If you're the American government, but it is, it is quite funny that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=315.6s)]
*  as Biden was like, come on, Jack, don't do it. Don't stop these children. Oh, I will show you [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=320.8s)]
*  Jesus. Oh, you'll have a come to Jesus moment. Right. And then Benjamin and Yahoo will be like, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=328.88s)]
*  we are the children tomorrow. We will keep the children like every day that would, that is what [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=333.6s)]
*  would happen. And now Donald Trump is like, Oh dude, look at the sweetheart deal we gave you. Come on. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=340.88s)]
*  It's everything you ever wanted. Please don't keep coming. Give. And Vladimir Putin's like, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=346.8s)]
*  no, we're going to do that. We're going to keep keep actually you suck my dick. In some ways, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=353.6s)]
*  obviously you have way less motion with a guy like Vladimir Putin than you're supposed to have [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=360.08s)]
*  with Benjamin and Yahoo, but still dumb, still absolutely idiotic for him to put himself out there [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=364.32s)]
*  in this way to look like a fool. Anyway, let's get back to the Ukraine peace talks. Now the tax [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=374.32s)]
*  on the Capitol in months, president Trump posting on social media, Vladimir stop the peace deal done. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=380.88s)]
*  Yo, I'm sorry. This was awesome. Like in the background, in the background, horrifying events [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=387.92s)]
*  are taking place. 12 people were right in Kiev, but Donald Trump's response to this is to go [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=394.8s)]
*  Vladimir stop. Like what the are you saying? What are you doing? God damn. He literally is going, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  this isn't you Vladimir. This isn't your heart. It's like, bro, I don't know if you know this, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=412.96s)]
*  but he invaded the country. You know, this is absolutely his heart. What the do you mean? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  You saying that the US is turning the UK a country with no motion was an elite take. Oh yeah. No, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=425.84s)]
*  a country that still believes that they have like global superpower status. Meanwhile, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=431.12s)]
*  has has completely lost all of its influential role in the global stage. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=438.64000000000004s)]
*  That's what he, that's what he did. Vladimir stop. I was, and we're in the midst of talking [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=448.48s)]
*  peace and missiles were fired. And I was not happy with it. President Trump has repeatedly said he [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=455.36s)]
*  could end the war on day one. In an interview with time magazine, the president now saying, quote, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=461.36s)]
*  I said that as an exaggeration months into his second term, the war has not ended. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=466.64s)]
*  Oh, office. When asked what concessions Russia was giving up for peace, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=471.36s)]
*  the president says Putin is not taking the whole country, stopping the war, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=475.52s)]
*  stopping taking the whole country. Pretty big concern. Wow. What a concession. He's not nuking [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=480.8s)]
*  Germany. That's a concession too. If we're just making up stuff that Vladimir Putin may not even [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=488.48s)]
*  have the capability of doing, that's awesome. What an awesome way to talk about this deal. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=495.44s)]
*  You have so much motion, sir. Incredible, incredible deal maker, dude. Yeah. Well, it's okay. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=502.32s)]
*  He's not, he's not invading Poland. So that's the concession. He's not invading Poland. That's, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=508.56s)]
*  that's a big deal for me. I think the Trump administration has put forward a peace proposal [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=514.48s)]
*  that would prohibit NATO membership for Ukraine and force Ukraine to give up land that Russia has [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=519.28s)]
*  seized since its invasion. In addition to giving up Crimea, the president telling time [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=524.24s)]
*  Crimea will stay with Russia and Zelensky understands that and everybody understands [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=528.96s)]
*  that it's been with them for a long time. But Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky has rejected [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=533.44s)]
*  that idea and pushed back against the proposal saying we will negotiate. We will not surrender [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  for the white house. It's in a bound face from president Trump's first term. When his [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=544.96s)]
*  administration pledged that Crimea would remain a part of Ukraine and before becoming secretary [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=548.8s)]
*  of state, Marco Rubio spoke out about the danger allowing Russia to keep Crimea. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=553.76s)]
*  The president's special envoy to the middle East, Steve Witkoff is back in Russia meeting with [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=559.76s)]
*  Russian president Vladimir Putin. But again, George, this comes as Russia continues their aggression [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=564.08s)]
*  and their attacks against Ukraine. And Rachel, the president also in this trade war with China, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=568.56s)]
*  China made a couple of moves overnight, but also said there's no talks. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=573.52s)]
*  Exactly, George. And they're really pushing back hard against the president's repeated claims. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=577.36s)]
*  I'm sorry, but they're the funniest thing that has taken place so far that I'm noticing in [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=582.0s)]
*  mainstream outlets and mainstream reporting is that due to the overwhelming incompetence of the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=587.84s)]
*  Trump administration, even the media is forced to take a neutral stance towards China as opposed [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=598.0s)]
*  to consistently being like, well, you can't trust the Chinese. They're Chinese. Like normally, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=606.24s)]
*  if this was the branded administration and they were trying to enforce similar trade policies or [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=610.96s)]
*  whatever, like the way they would go about it would be a little bit more professional. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=617.44s)]
*  And therefore the media would do what they normally do. They'd be like, well, you can't [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  trust the Chinese for saying that they're not actually talking to the Biden envoys because [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=625.76s)]
*  they're Chinese. They're probably lying, blah, blah, blah. Right. They would be synophobic as [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  fuck. But because Trump is so belligerent and in broad daylight, transparently deliberate, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=634.64s)]
*  transparently belligerent that the media has basically been forced into a corner where they [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=642.0s)]
*  have to recognize the, the like, they have to recognize our Chinese enemies as a, as a [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=646.96s)]
*  more responsible party in this convo. Incredible. Donald Trump, the great unifier, just not in the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=655.36s)]
*  way that he thought it would work, has unified, has basically created a support system amongst [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=662.08s)]
*  China and Japan. Okay. That is, remember chat, when I went to Japan and I met with the Japanese [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=671.84s)]
*  communist party, one of the questions I asked the Japanese communist party, which is an opposition [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  party that is supposed to be, you know, fundamentally and functionally closer to China [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=685.36s)]
*  than any other Japanese party, there are the fucking communist party. And I asked them, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=691.68s)]
*  like, how do you feel about China? And they were like, nah, no, fuck. No, we don't, we don't fuck [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=696.8s)]

*  actually, we have an incredibly important trade relationship with China and we are not going to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=707.12s)]
*  compromise that despite the fact that we're a fucking vassal state for us empire. That he is [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=711.76s)]
*  in fact engaging in talks and negotiations with China to end this trade war that he started. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=716.64s)]
*  The president, a new interview with Time Magazine says that he has spoken to president Xi, but [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=722.08s)]
*  China is pushing back on that, calling it fake news, saying there are no negotiations on tariff [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=726.88s)]
*  issues and no agreement has been reached. George. Okay, Rachel. Thanks for arch. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=732.48s)]

*  Steve Witkoff told Vladimir Putin. This was his fourth meeting with the Russian president [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=746.64s)]
*  as Donald Trump continues his push for peace. But there wasn't any rush. Before the meeting, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=751.92s)]
*  Witkoff found time to go sightseeing with Kremlin envoy Kirill Demitriyev, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=757.92s)]
*  a visual demonstration of how Washington and Moscow appear increasingly in lockstep. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=762.88s)]
*  We're just reestablishing contacts. We're just trying to [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=769.12s)]
*  find the way out from this terrible crisis which was created by previous American administration. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=779.04s)]
*  Witkoff's visit coincided with a symbolic anniversary of Soviet American cooperation. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  80 years since their troops met in Germany before the end of World War II. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=795.2s)]
*  So are we poised for another historic collaboration? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=800.24s)]
*  It is difficult to say. History repeats itself. Let's hope that we will achieve victory. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=806.08s)]
*  Vladimir Vladimirovich will make the right decision. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=811.36s)]
*  I doubted because a lot was promised, but nothing has been done yet. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=816.88s)]
*  Speaking of promises, another from Donald Trump that he can end the war soon. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  I want to say 5,000 young men. They happen to be mostly Ukrainian, Russian. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  5,000 young. I love this universe that we exist in where all of the Harvard Yale graduate, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=835.2s)]
*  like think tank lovers that have spent years and years slaving away at the Atlantic Council [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=843.36s)]
*  have been cast aside by the administration for a fucking guy that plays golf with Donald Trump. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=852.08s)]
*  Oh my God. Remember, Steve Witkoff, his qualification for this position as the top [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  American diplomat is that he plays golf with Donald Trump. He's just a real estate guy before [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=868.4000000000001s)]
*  this. And in some respects, I think that calcified Atlantic Council approach, oops, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=876.24s)]
*  that calcified Atlantic Council approach on ironically has been a setback in negotiations. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=885.12s)]
*  So in some ways fucking Steve Witkoff is Steve Goatkoff. It's crazy because let's be real. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=891.84s)]
*  What he's doing is what he's doing is presenting himself as Donald Trump in every room. That's all [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=900.96s)]
*  he's doing. And Donald Trump has a lot of crazy ideas, but sometimes Donald Trump and his crazy [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=905.6s)]
*  ideas get to force a ceasefire. I mean, I think you're going to get a stalemate exchange for a [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=911.2s)]
*  slaughter. I think so too, but we'll see. Ukrainian and Russian men. And that's, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=916.32s)]
*  that's a big honor if I could do it. I think, I think we're pretty close. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=921.84s)]
*  The Kremlin called Witkoff's visit constructive and useful and said it brought their respective [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=926.08s)]
*  positions closer together. That's not good news for Ukraine. For them, Donald Trump's current [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=931.12s)]
*  peace plan is already far too one sided. How many it is? Not everything's going the Kremlin's way. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=937.12s)]
*  A senior general was killed in this car bomb outside Moscow, which Russia blamed on Ukraine. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=946.4000000000001s)]
*  But it seems there's not much Kiev could do right now to change the way things are heading. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=952.4000000000001s)]
*  Ivor Bennett, Sky News, Moscow. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=957.84s)]
*  Today, special envoy Steve Witkoff is meeting with Vladimir Putin again in Moscow. This follows [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=965.6s)]
*  Russia's attacks in Kiev. They were just abhorrent yesterday, leaving at least 12 innocent people [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=971.0400000000001s)]
*  dead. So funny. Again, I always remind people of this, but Brian killed me. The person who's [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=975.92s)]
*  speaking right now was a Ron DeSantis head. And these are the exact reasons why he was a Ron [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=982.64s)]
*  DeSantis head because he was worried that Donald Trump would do crazy shit and not toe the state [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  department agenda on Ukraine and, and do ridiculously irresponsible things like blow up global trade for [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=996.4799999999999s)]
*  no reason other than because he's fucking bored. Which is why every time he talks about the stuff, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1004.0s)]
*  he'll just like slot that in where he'll be like, it's abhorrent, abhorrent moment. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1009.44s)]
*  ... Steve Witkoff is meeting with Vladimir Putin again in Moscow. This follows Russia's attacks [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1013.2s)]
*  in Kiev. They were just abhorrent yesterday, leaving at least 12 innocent people dead, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1018.56s)]
*  with President Trump pushing for an end to the war. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1023.28s)]
*  I have no allegiance to anybody. I have allegiance to saving lives and I want to save a lot of lives. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1027.28s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people. It's the war. It's the soldiers. And if we can do that, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1033.44s)]
*  also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1039.68s)]
*  It's a killing field. 5,000 soldiers a week on average. And we want to stop that. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1046.16s)]
*  So Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keene. The president always makes that clear. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1054.16s)]
*  It's his objective to stop the killing. Are they in route to stopping the killing? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1058.88s)]
*  It doesn't appear so, based on where we are, for a couple of reasons. One, Zelensky and his team [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1066.8000000000002s)]
*  accepted a 30-day ceasefire and removed the condition. He wanted some kind of security [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1072.96s)]
*  guarantees to be able to do that. Russia was offered the same thing and they have rejected it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1079.1200000000001s)]
*  And not only that, they have continued to focus on killing civilians, targeting civilians, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1085.84s)]
*  because they want to break the will of the Ukrainian people and put pressure on Zelensky [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1092.96s)]
*  and also on our administration to make more concessions. That's what's going on. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1098.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is full throttle on the part of Putin. He is the problem here. He has been the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1103.76s)]
*  problem from the beginning because he obviously invaded the country illegally and he committed [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  genocide. He's a thug and he's a killer and he's a war criminal. And he certainly only wants to go [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1113.6s)]
*  to that negotiating table and probably make a deal. I'm not gonna lie. All these fucking guys [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1119.6s)]
*  deserve Donald Trump more than anybody else because now they're perma stuck in a position. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1126.0s)]
*  Talk about how fucked up what Russia is doing because these are all okay. I'm going to keep it [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1133.12s)]
*  a buck fifty with you. Okay, Brian killed me. This guy, all of these fucking think tank guys, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1139.6s)]
*  they're all full throw to support to Ukraine guys. Okay. But they have to also Dick ride Donald Trump. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1144.24s)]
*  It's what they did. Like their ambition and their motivation is partly responsible for [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1151.84s)]
*  Ukraine being in the position that it's in right now. And it's not just because like Vladimir Putin [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1158.24s)]
*  invaded. I'm saying like they're constant egging on of Ukraine. The false claims that Ukraine was [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1162.08s)]
*  going to join NATO when everybody knew that that was never going to fucking happen. All this stuff [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1168.08s)]
*  has played a major role and they've quite literally lost the war. They've lost the battle. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1172.6399999999999s)]
*  They lost the battle at the very least. Like the battle lines are not in favor of their proxy in [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1179.12s)]
*  this process and they have to, they have to still under normal circumstances, they would be like [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1182.8s)]
*  Vladimir Pootler. We need to kill him. Like we need to keep doing this. We need to keep doing this. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  We need to urge Ukrainians to lower their age of conscription to fucking 18. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1195.04s)]
*  But because it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump is talking about how, you know, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1200.96s)]
*  Vladimir stop. They have to present this in a way where on the one hand, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1206.32s)]
*  Pootler is evil, but also it's cool that our president is besties with him. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1211.76s)]
*  So they're just like stuck in this weird, they're stuck in this weird bind on the one hand, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1217.2s)]
*  they want the war to continue. On the other hand, they have to make it seem like Donald Trump is [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1222.72s)]
*  awesome in the way that he's dealing with it. And he is demonstrably not awesome in the way that he's [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1228.08s)]
*  dealing with it. Unless he's able to get concessions that make Ukraine very vulnerable to a future [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1232.56s)]
*  attack because he has not given up one iota. Our intelligence services publicly have released [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1240.56s)]
*  information that demonstrates the fact that Russia fully intends to take control of Ukraine [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1247.84s)]
*  and then also other countries in Eastern Europe. That's his objective. And we have to keep that in [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1254.8s)]
*  mind when we're dealing with him. General, you just told me something in the break. I did not [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1260.0s)]
*  think it was possible. The Ukrainians want to write a check to buy Patriot missiles, a defense [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1266.1599999999999s)]
*  battery. And we said no. Yeah, we did. I'm not sure the reason why, but it opens up the door [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1271.28s)]
*  for an avenue that we really need to take advantage of. The State Department has a program called [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1280.72s)]
*  foreign military financing. That is direct loans where you can get military equipment, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1286.96s)]
*  you pay back the loan at interest. So the government makes money here. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1293.68s)]
*  Poland is buying tanks, helicopters, air defense system, high Mars, etc. Over $10 billion worth of [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1298.3999999999999s)]
*  stuff. The Ukrainians can do the same because now they have collateral in the mineral, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1305.84s)]
*  rare mineral development and other things in the country. And also they obviously have. Oh my God, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1311.4399999999998s)]
*  bro, I'm not gonna lie when I hear this kind of shit from this admin. Or when I hear this kind [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1318.1599999999999s)]
*  of shit from like generals and stuff, I'm like, you are also just as stupid and awful and evil [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1324.64s)]
*  as Donald Trump is. Like the proper way to go about this is to shit on Donald Trump and to tell [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1332.72s)]
*  Donald Trump to shut the fuck up about Zelensky and to try to manage this, manage the situation [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1338.5600000000002s)]
*  in a way that Ukraine, in a way where Ukraine doesn't get fucked over in the process, where [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1346.48s)]
*  we're not just like literally picking apart Ukraine for scraps, except these guys literally [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1350.0800000000002s)]
*  are just like, dude, it's awesome. We can give them high Mars. Like who's going to fucking use, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1354.4s)]
*  who's going to use the Patriot missiles, dude? Like they've, they've run out of, it's like, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1359.2800000000002s)]
*  you look at a situation rare. Well, raw earth is mine now. And this guy's saying, oh, they can use [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1363.76s)]
*  the raw earth as collateral to purchase Patriot missiles. So fucking fantastic opportunities. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1371.92s)]
*  Just a missile salesman. Like I know I shit on Donald Trump a lot. I know I shit on Donald Trump [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1378.3200000000002s)]
*  a lot and he is fucking worthy of being shitted on, but it's not like this guy's alternative is, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1383.68s)]
*  is more intelligent either. Like his alternative is to, to farm Ukraine even fucking further. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1390.0s)]
*  It's crazy. Some money because people have been giving them money and that's what they wanted to [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1397.04s)]
*  do with the, the Patriot systems. We can take the American taxpayer out of this and following [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1401.44s)]
*  Steve Witkoff's meeting in Moscow, president Trump says he believes it's time for president [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1407.68s)]
*  Zelensky and president Putin to meet just later in Rome, a good day in talks and meetings with [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1410.64s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine. They are very close to a deal and the two sides should now meet at very high [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1415.92s)]
*  levels to finish it off. Most of the major points are agreed to stop the bloodshed. Now we will be [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1423.92s)]
*  wherever is necessary to help facilitate the end to this cruel and senseless war. Following Steve [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1431.2s)]

*  age of conscription to 18? I know what the Atlantic council's position is. That's why I [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1575.04s)]
*  directly called out the Atlantic council in this process. I'm asking you why you think the [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1580.1599999999999s)]
*  Brandonian position looking at the writing on the wall was to say, you need to lower your age of [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1586.24s)]
*  conscription to 18. How much, how much more can you withstand in that process? I know why the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1594.0s)]
*  Atlantic council would have a more militant attitude towards Ukraine. That's kind of their [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1601.28s)]
*  whole shtick. I do not know nor have an answer for that, but I do know that answer. The US government [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  is strange and slightly off hinge regardless. Okay. That's why I didn't just, that is why I didn't [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1612.32s)]
*  just ask you about Trump's position on this by way of Mike Walz. I asked you about Brandon and his [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1619.04s)]
*  position on this because Brandon did NATO. He's the NATO guy, right? He loved sticking it to [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1626.64s)]
*  Russia. That was his major thing. He was like, Oh yeah. I love unlimited baby murder in Gaza. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1633.76s)]
*  And I love sticking it to Russia. We're, we're, we're destroying our foreign adversaries military [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1639.68s)]

*  He's August Jack. He did it. So why did that guy also simultaneously say, well, given the situation [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1658.24s)]
*  on the battlefield, you're going to have to either lower your age of conscription to 18, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1665.12s)]
*  or we're going to have to reconsider it. Don't tell us how far you are trans. Oh no. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1672.0s)]

*  And fun Ukraine's military buildup rather significantly. Look at it. Putin is going to [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1695.44s)]
*  reject, which I think he's going to do the deal. What then do we do? One, crippling sanctions would [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1701.92s)]
*  be option one. And two, up gun Ukraine, up gun Ukraine to bring Putin to the negotiating table. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1708.4s)]
*  Not so Ukraine can continue to fight, but Putin pays attention to that military equation and who [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1716.0s)]
*  has an advantage there more than anything else, actually more than sanctions. I just hope the [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1723.04s)]
*  president knows. These are levers that we can use. We can use these levers. I hope the president [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1728.16s)]
*  knows that this happens. Sometimes it happens beneath his level because this is defense. Who [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1732.48s)]
*  would not want to from going into a city? Lavrov told the Face the Nation that he says the president [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1736.96s)]
*  of the United States and I think rightly so that we are moving in the right direction and they are [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1745.6000000000001s)]
*  heading towards peace. They are ready to. Yeah, dude, Trump just hasn't seen your coverage on it. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1750.4s)]
*  That's what it is. Bro tweeted out Vladimir stop not 24 hours ago and this dumbass thinks like, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1755.92s)]
*  oh, maybe I'll be able to get to him by way of a good deal by talking about how good of a deal this [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1764.4s)]
*  is. Amazing. I feel like Trump is just cooked on this process. And even then, when I hear stuff [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1770.96s)]
*  like this, I'm like, damn, like even Trump is in all of his idiocy is further along a more [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1778.4s)]
*  manageable position than these fucking monsters are because the reality of the matter is glazing [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1786.5600000000002s)]
*  Adolf Pootler aside. And by the way, there is no guarantee that Vladimir Putin is even going to [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1793.0400000000002s)]
*  abide by any ceasefire, let alone, you know, sign off on a fucking ceasefire. Make no mistake. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1798.24s)]
*  And I do think that Trump's way of managing this situation is actually working against that. Okay, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1805.28s)]
*  but having said that a ceasefire or some sort of treaty is inevitable. It's just you're you're [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1811.84s)]
*  basically moving the you're moving how many people dies in the process. That's why I was in favor of [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1819.44s)]
*  the Ontario program, the 15 point ceasefire negotiation, when Ukraine had tremendously [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1826.1599999999999s)]
*  more leverage back then, who I think that Vladimir Putin has the capacity to take over [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1832.48s)]
*  the entirety of Ukraine. I don't. But that doesn't matter. What matters is how many [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1837.28s)]
*  Ukrainians will die. Because even if they were to lower the age of conscription to 18, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1842.24s)]
*  and then America started sending in weapons again. Okay, a steady flow of weapons, there is no [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1848.48s)]
*  guarantee that they'd be able to train the military fast enough, have enough appetite to fight back. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1855.2s)]
*  And be able to be able to push Russia out of these territories that they've have established [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1862.64s)]
*  hardened positions inside of. So there's no guarantee that this is going to work anyway. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1868.64s)]
*  So in that regard, I think if Donald Trump was not a fucking asshole, I think him pushing for [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1875.68s)]
*  some kind of ceasefire while also trying to figure out concessions to give to Ukraine. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1883.28s)]
*  So it doesn't. So it doesn't come across as though they're just like discarding [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1888.8s)]
*  discarding these people as though they're nothing. Oh shit. So many text messages from [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1894.56s)]
*  my family in the process. This is crazy. Anyway, what do you think? Trump cares about humanity? No, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1900.56s)]
*  I think Trump's ambition for this is totally artificial. He thinks that the situation is lost [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1906.72s)]
*  and he foolishly thinks that as long as he can pass this on to the previous administration as [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1914.8799999999999s)]
*  a mistake that he just closed off, then he will look like a hero. He doesn't give a fuck about [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1919.1999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine or Ukrainians. I'd go, I go so far as to say he probably cares about being liked by [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1926.8s)]
*  Vladimir Putin more than he cares about Ukrainians in general. He's just looking for a W there. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1932.96s)]
*  And he thinks if he sucks Vladimir Putin as hard as he has thus far, then Vladimir Putin will give [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1938.6399999999999s)]
*  him that W. Ironically enough, the very fact that he's sucking Vladimir Putin and the statements [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1944.6399999999999s)]
*  that he's made leading up to the election is the reason why Vladimir Putin has more leverage now [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1950.24s)]
*  than he did even before. Beyond the battlefield, I mean, leverage in the diplomacy side, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1955.9199999999998s)]
*  art of the deal, baby. Reach a deal. Do you believe the foreign minister of Russia? Just real quick, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1961.6799999999998s)]
*  because I want to get to Iran too. No, he lies through his teeth. He's been lying for 25 years, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1966.64s)]
*  just like the guy he works for. This is all the Russians narrative, their playbook, their propaganda. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1973.0400000000002s)]
*  Where's the evidence of that to date? They didn't, they walked away from that. What was reasonable, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1978.8000000000002s)]
*  the president offered them a 30 day ceasefire, not six months, not a year, not permanent 30 days. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1985.68s)]
*  Zelensky says, yes, the Russians say no, that's where they really are. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1992.3200000000002s)]
*  By going this far, the president took political risk and giving Vladimir Putin a chance at peace. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=1996.64s)]
*  He's better not embarrass the president in my view, because he'll feel the backlash. He already [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2001.2s)]
*  got rebuked. Yes. He already got rebuked. The president looked like a giant pussy, dude. What [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2005.6000000000001s)]
*  are you talking about? He got rebuked. Oh, you mean when he said Vladimir stop? That was the rebuked, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2011.44s)]
*  dude? What an incredible rebuked that was. Didn't we all? Yeah. Everyone remembers that historical [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2017.68s)]
*  moment when the American president said Vladimir stop. Wow. Such tremendous backlash. This is the [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2025.68s)]
*  most Brandonized moment. This is literally CNN saying Brandon is actually having a come to Jesus [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2032.88s)]
*  moment with Benjamin Netanyahu. Incredible yesterday. So now tomorrow, third, third of [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2040.8s)]
*  nuke talks with Iran. They gave Michael Anton, senior state department official to lead the [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2047.2s)]
*  technical team on Iran's nuclear negotiations. How do you feel about where we're at right now? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2051.92s)]
*  What do your sources tell you? What kind of progress is being made? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2057.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, we'll have to see. I mean, we know a couple of things. One, Iran's not going to dismantle the [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2063.04s)]
*  program as we asked them to do, you know, by a date certain with inspections and verification. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2068.64s)]
*  Obviously, that's not happening. That's the same thing that Obama did, by the way, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2076.2400000000002s)]
*  when they began negotiations in 2013, they told Iran to dismantle your program, give up. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2080.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other side of the story. That's really funny is that Donald Trump, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2085.68s)]
*  who delivered the death blow to Barack Obama's signature foreign policy accomplishment has now [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2090.3999999999996s)]
*  turned around and is trying to do Barack Obama's Iran denuclearization agreement. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2097.04s)]
*  I fucking love that, dude. That is awesome. Up in Richmond, give up the centrifuges, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2102.16s)]
*  give up your ballistic missiles. They balked. And then we accepted civil nuclear power in [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2107.28s)]
*  Richmond. They kept their centrifuges and they kept their ballistic missiles. They eventually got [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2114.4s)]
*  real close to a nuclear weapon, as we all know, which is the concern we have today. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2118.88s)]
*  The Iranians are masters at working these negotiations to their favor. So we have to [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2123.6800000000003s)]
*  keep an eye on this. Certainly this guy has straightforwardly the worst positions [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2129.6000000000004s)]
*  on everything, by the way. He's like, I don't know about this Iran denuclearization agreement. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2133.76s)]
*  Maybe we should just nuke Iran ahead of time. The administration wants a nuclear program that [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2139.36s)]
*  cannot even come close to weaponization. But even if you take away all the enrichment and leave the [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2147.28s)]
*  centrifuges and the ballistic missiles, they can get an enriched uranium for many countries. We, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2152.88s)]
*  we get it from four or five different countries to include Russia. China, Russia, and North Korea [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2159.68s)]
*  all have enriched uranium. Why? Because they all have nuclear weapons and they're their closest [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2166.3199999999997s)]
*  allies. So clandestinely, they can still get enriched uranium and they keep the centrifuges [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2170.7999999999997s)]
*  to spin that and get it to weaponization grade. And they keep the ballistic missiles so they [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2177.68s)]
*  can deliver it. That's what we have to be very careful of going forward here. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2183.8399999999997s)]
*  We got, it got to be Americans on the ground watching the dismantling. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2188.24s)]
*  Maybe people will yell at me for saying this, but I do think that the region will be way more [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2191.6s)]
*  stable if Iran had fucking nukes. This is not just my take. This is the Mercheimer protocol. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2195.52s)]
*  He says this as well. I think Jeffrey Sachs might've said this too. It's kind of insane to think [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2201.52s)]
*  that I could get away with saying this shit. I mean, I have before, but [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2208.3199999999997s)]
*  but like the Hassan Abed, the Hassan Abed doctrine remains true. And it's low key part. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2211.44s)]
*  It's the only reason why the only reason why I think this is because Israel has nukes. I feel [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2219.6000000000004s)]
*  like if Israel did not have nukes, which they have, and it's too late and they've had it for a very [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2225.1200000000003s)]
*  long time. If Israel did not have nukes, then I would not have this exact same perspective. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2229.6000000000004s)]
*  Do you think nuclear winter will be beneficial for climate change? I mean, as it stands, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2234.96s)]
*  you either have a fucking nuke or you don't. You know what I mean? If you don't have a nuke, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2240.56s)]
*  you get walked over. What are nations supposed to do? Don't make me tap the sign, dude. Don't [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2244.24s)]
*  make me tap the fucking sign. There it is. The Hassan Abed doctrine, a guide for nation building. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2249.36s)]
*  Rule number one, get nukes. Rule number two, do not give up the nukes. You know who did the [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2254.4s)]
*  rule number two? You know who violated rule number two? Ukraine, bitch. That's who violated rule [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2258.48s)]
*  number two. Ukraine fucked up. And you're over here talking about, oh, dude, countries can't have [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2263.6s)]
*  nukes. What are you talking about? Okay. Rule number three, if you're accused of having nukes, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2269.12s)]
*  drop everything and immediately find some nukes. Especially if America says you have nukes, you [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2273.6s)]
*  have to find nukes. If you don't have nukes after America says you have nukes, you're fucked. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2280.64s)]
*  Countries that have gone through this process and did not find nukes leadership like Gaddafi. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2284.7999999999997s)]
*  Gaddafi learned the problem with rule number three. Okay. Saddam Hussein, a different version of that. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2290.56s)]
*  Both of those guys went out in not so great ways. Okay. Ukraine is a violator of rule number two, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2298.56s)]
*  gave up the fucking nukes. I'm not a I'm not Mr. nukes have actually created global stability and [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2306.08s)]
*  global peace. But as it stands, you look at countries that don't have nukes, and you look [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2311.8399999999997s)]
*  at countries that do have nukes. Okay. And it kind of feels like countries that don't have nukes are [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2316.96s)]
*  getting dominated by countries that do. When do Ukraine have nukes? I mean, technically it was [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2323.2799999999997s)]
*  USSR nukes that were in Ukraine way of using them, but it doesn't matter. You should have just on [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2329.12s)]
*  principle never given up the nukes. Bro, Soviet soldier literally prevented nuclear Holocaust [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2335.04s)]
*  like his defo, not a force of stability. That's right. You admit the glory of the Soviets. I've [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2339.6s)]
*  never not admitted the glory of the Soviets. What are you talking about? Technically USSR [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2343.7599999999998s)]
*  cease to exist and they belong to Ukraine. Yeah. But the, the, like the launching platform was [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2348.24s)]
*  still in control of Russia in the control of Russia. So they couldn't technically use it. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2353.52s)]
*  Yeah. The white fascist South African government denuked South Africa for this reason. They [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2359.68s)]
*  didn't want to black left this government to have nukes. Why did they want to denuclearize Iran? So [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2363.2799999999997s)]
*  bad. I'm a zoomer. So I'm not caught up. I mean, it's because it's because when a country has nukes, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2367.9199999999996s)]
*  they have full blown autonomy, full blown sovereignty, and they can get away with [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2374.24s)]
*  being treated differently. They get treated differently than countries that are devoid of [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2378.3199999999997s)]
*  nukes. I mean, look at Ukraine, look at Ukraine, look at what's happening to Ukraine. Yeah. That [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2383.9199999999996s)]
*  program in the way Libya did in South Africa did and Ukraine did. And that's just the beginning. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2390.64s)]
*  I'm not sure the Israelis are going to sit on the side if they think it's a bad deal. General [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2396.7999999999997s)]
*  Jack Keane, there's so much going on. The Institute of study of war helps unwind it on a daily basis [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2401.76s)]
*  and you're chairman of that. Thanks so much, general. Have a great weekend. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2406.32s)]
*  So NATO chief Amar, did you say Vietnam doesn't have nukes? Yeah, dude. What happened? I mean, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2411.76s)]

*  it. The Vietnamese population. That's what happens when you don't have nukes. When you don't have nukes, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2424.5600000000004s)]
*  you get fucking genocide. It's so hard that even currently almost half a century later. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2431.36s)]
*  Okay, you still you still have disabilities in the in the upcoming generation like that. They're [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2439.28s)]
*  still born with birth defects. Sorry, I saw XQC duking it out in my replies with mighty Keef. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_vCzpmNjc&t=2449.6800000000003s)]
