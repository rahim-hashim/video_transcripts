*  I don't like him. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  I don't dislike him. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=212.02s)]
*  I just just surprised that he's having a rally right now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he's doing a you know, it's time to get up off our asses and get back to work rally to try to get people to you know. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=217.52s)]
*  To try to get people to ensure that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=231.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  He's like he's got smoke for everybody right now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=234.22s)]
*  He's got smoke for the Democrats. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=237.32s)]
*  He's got smoke for the Republicans. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=239.72s)]
*  He's saying like we got to do more for the citizens, you know, for the American citizens. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=241.22s)]
*  And I feel like the administration do some scary stuff in general with the with the administrative state and talk about this guy's talking about abolishing the Department of Education today. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=245.22s)]
*  So, you know, it's more of a critique on that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=260.92s)]
*  And how to move forward, try to figure out a way to to get out of the bind that we're in. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=266.82s)]
*  Well, like when it comes to the Department of Education. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=273.42s)]
*  What are they what are they doing for us? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=278.32s)]
*  What because I know there's the education. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=281.12s)]
*  They're not helping the kids. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=283.42s)]
*  What is it doing? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=285.02s)]
*  What is the Department of Education doing? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=287.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  There's a there's a lot of. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=290.82s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff that it does specifically for like disabled students like setting. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=292.42s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of there's a lot of funding that it there's there's a lot of funding on the program such as that one. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=296.72s)]
*  There is, you know, some kind of regulatory mechanism that it it maintains over over school. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=306.62s)]
*  So people aren't just like teaching random crazy shit. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=313.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=315.82s)]
*  It's schools stuff like that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  Big part of it is also student loans, obviously. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=318.72s)]
*  Trump is definitely keeping that part. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  He's not abolishing student loan debt, it seems. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think he's going to get rid of helping kids get, you know, special needs kids and stuff, too. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  See, he already got a bunch of they just passed a continued resolution that gave Trump the power to cut a bunch of these programs like mental health programs that that they're doing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  Programs that that help people struggling with like mental health and things like that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=347.12s)]
*  So some of the challenges I see right now in all of it is that this last administration went through and I mean how much money is being spent on stupid stuff. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=351.72s)]
*  But a lot of the stupid stuff like a trans Sesame Street in Iraq, why are we spending money on that? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's that you're talking about the USA stuff. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=374.42s)]
*  Yeah, you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=376.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but that's the thing is if you're spending that kind of money, you know, the kids are our school. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=377.62s)]
*  We test the bottom of the barrel. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=385.12s)]
*  Yeah, get that better when you're spending that much money on it and the US United States kids are just dumb as a box of rocks compared to the majority of the other countries and we spend more money than anybody. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  What's wrong with it? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=400.92s)]
*  How do we fix it? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=402.32s)]
*  No, I agree. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=403.92s)]
*  I think our education system is absolutely awful. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=405.12s)]
*  This thing is like Trump always talks about Norway and talks about like China is like these guys have so much better education than we do. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=409.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=415.32s)]
*  He's always talking about that and it's like those countries don't have private education. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=415.62s)]
*  We do they have a they have a very different approach. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=419.42s)]
*  They understand that the next generation must be properly educated so that we can have a competitive labor force. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=422.82s)]
*  And I feel like I feel like we're moving in the opposite direction. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=430.12s)]
*  If we want to fix education, I think the real the real solution is to to make sure that you know, we have a proper regulatory mechanism and no room for private schools or charter schools and things like that and to bring up the public structure to resemble some of these other countries that have significantly better outcomes. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=432.92s)]
*  You know, yeah, I know it sounds like a dream in America. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  But well, the other thing that you see right now is those those countries you're talking about like China and you know Asians and stuff like that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=459.12s)]
*  It's not just the schools. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=468.72s)]
*  It's the it's the family unit is also that way. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=470.12s)]
*  You know, it's a big deal to be, you know, educated and smart and take care of your parents are on top of the kids to make sure that they study and you know, it's it's all it's just normal for them to wear here in the US. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=474.82s)]
*  It's just like we can go skateboarding today by mom, you know, the is your homework done? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=488.02s)]
*  I'll do it later. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=493.62s)]
*  I mean, it's a part of it's the family unit to sure. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=495.52s)]
*  But you know, you can't you can't control you can't like enforce culture, right? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  If that's the problem, like the best you can do is still try to bring up the at the government level at least. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=507.41999999999996s)]
*  I try to bring up the quality of education to the best of your ability and and make it so that people actually enjoy going to school, you know, like one of the big problems in America is school classroom sizes. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  Schools are so underfunded. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=526.32s)]
*  They got 40 students to a classroom. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=528.72s)]
*  Teachers can't deal with 40 students, you know, that's like that's it's crazy. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=532.22s)]
*  It's disastrous. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=536.12s)]
*  And when the product is bad, then the teachers are already overworked. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=537.62s)]
*  They're not getting paid enough. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=544.12s)]
*  And on top of that, they have to take care of 40 kids. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=546.02s)]
*  Nobody wants to nobody wants to go to school. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=548.72s)]
*  Nobody wants to pay attention and then it reflects in the results. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=550.62s)]
*  We're also more prone to pay a guy playing football or baseball millions of dollars. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=555.32s)]
*  That's who yeah crap about the people shaping our children. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=561.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean like my grandson, we have custody of him. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=568.02s)]
*  He's here in the North District. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=570.52s)]
*  When he first got there, you went and met, you know, the teacher meetings and stuff. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=572.72s)]
*  His math teacher. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=577.62s)]
*  122 kids for one woman. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=579.62s)]
*  That's yeah, she has three classes and she goes well, at least he's in my class. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=582.62s)]
*  Or does he goes no, he'll I'm visiting in that classroom. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=588.22s)]
*  She has his classroom where she's at. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=592.22s)]
*  Then there's a camera that projects her under two other classes. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=594.32s)]
*  That's insane where they use aids to help. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=598.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's unacceptable. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  That's so totally utterly insane. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=606.72s)]
*  But see, that's what I mean. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=609.82s)]
*  Like they don't that's not happening in Sweden. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=610.72s)]
*  That's not happening in Norway. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=612.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, as a matter of fact, what is happening here? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=614.12s)]
*  They did that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=617.22s)]
*  Vegas. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=617.82s)]
*  That's the other parts of fishing up to because we get the federal. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=618.32s)]
*  But we also have state funds. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=621.52s)]
*  This place generates over a billion dollars a month. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=623.02s)]
*  Yeah, and you can't help the kids here. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=625.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=627.52s)]
*  Well, they built stadiums with that money, you know, yeah, exactly. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  I think our expenditure priorities are completely out of whack. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=634.72s)]
*  And all of that serves the interest of corporations of the wealthy rather than like regular old citizens. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=639.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=646.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah, definitely. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=646.42s)]
*  It's a big part of what Bernie talks about. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=647.22s)]
*  I think is basically like getting back to some kind of common sense, some kind of normalcy in the way that the government works. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=649.02s)]
*  Because like the USA funding stuff when you talk about like, you know, trans sesame. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=657.52s)]
*  What is it? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=665.12s)]
*  Sesame Street or whatever like all that stuff is it's pennies, right? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=665.52s)]
*  Like that's it's nothing as a matter of fact, like the doge stuff that they were talking about, like Elon was coming out. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=670.42s)]
*  Being like, oh, you know, we are cutting eight billion dollars here and ten billion dollars there. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=677.02s)]
*  Like there was an investigation that was conducted and they looked into like the actual dollar value of things. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=682.42s)]
*  They cut. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=688.22s)]
*  It's not even a billion dollars. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=688.62s)]
*  Like they were saying they were cutting, you know, hundreds of billion. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=690.12s)]
*  They haven't even cut a billion dollars in expenditures and the USA funding got restored by by the Supreme Court anyway. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=693.12s)]
*  So it's the one area where like I don't even necessarily disagree all that much in terms of foreign aid and in terms of like where the money gets spent. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=701.9200000000001s)]
*  But that's the one thing that the Supreme Court restored already. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=711.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm more scared about the federal government layoffs because like there's a lot of people who are underemployed in this country. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=715.5200000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people who don't make enough money. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=725.22s)]
*  There's a lot of people that, you know, don't have any benefits package because they're not like regular W-2 wage laborers with any protection whatsoever. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=726.82s)]
*  And on top of that, you got the one like bastion, the last bastion of like middle class jobs in the federal government and you're cutting that by the tens of thousands for no discernible reason. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=739.02s)]
*  I'm like, things are going to start breaking, you know. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=752.22s)]
*  Well, the interesting thing is what the first the first round of them was just saying you had to come back into the office and they lost like 75 million of them or some amazing amount. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=756.62s)]
*  Just saying you have to come back to the office and work. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=769.12s)]
*  No, no, they they they wanted to they wanted to change the remote work structure back to like office back to office work. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=772.02s)]
*  Which I don't really care about to be to be honest, like I don't really care if people work from home. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=780.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I get the word from home. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=785.62s)]
*  Depending on what it is, in my opinion, when it comes to work from home and stuff, I think you get more done in an office setting than you do sitting at home. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=787.3199999999999s)]
*  But it also depends on what the career is. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=797.42s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it I mean, if you're just adding up numbers in the column, it doesn't matter where you do it at. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=800.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's mostly jobs like that. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=806.52s)]
*  I don't think that I don't think the federal people that need to go and like check the factory floor or whatever to make sure that everything is up to par work from home and be like, all right, I made it up. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=808.82s)]
*  I'm doing I'm doing regulation from my house. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=819.62s)]
*  Well, then you get the guys who are sitting there, you know, they're they have their government job, but they're also working a second job because they're only doing a little bit of work on the government stuff. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=823.12s)]
*  That doesn't make me happy. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=832.9200000000001s)]
*  Now, that lost my career when Biden took over. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=835.82s)]
*  Well, what did you do? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=838.5200000000001s)]
*  I used to work in the oil and gas industry. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=839.62s)]
*  Oh, you were in the oil and gas? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=841.32s)]
*  Wait, in Vegas or? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=842.4200000000001s)]
*  In Pennsylvania. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=844.32s)]
*  Oh, you did. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=846.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=847.22s)]
*  You worked in fragging? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=847.62s)]
*  Not kind of. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=849.12s)]
*  Well, we did. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=850.0200000000001s)]
*  We dealt with explosives on our end of it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=851.62s)]
*  They were we were the ones who put the holes in the casing and the earth. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=854.0200000000001s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=857.32s)]
*  And then they would, if it's fragged, if it's something that needs to be fragged, they would frack through our holes. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=857.9200000000001s)]
*  If not, it's just where the conventional oil and gas comes through. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=863.4200000000001s)]
*  So you're originally from Pennsylvania? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=866.72s)]
*  No, I'm originally from Southern California, but for 22 years I worked in the oil and gas industry. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=868.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=874.22s)]
*  And then you moved to Pennsylvania for that. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=874.4200000000001s)]
*  I lost my whole career, my whole life due to that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=876.22s)]
*  I lost all my pension, all of that over losing my job back when he took over. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=879.82s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=885.72s)]
*  Like the company cut the company to layoffs because they were worried? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=886.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, most of ours was all federal work with 70% of what our company did was on federal lands. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=889.92s)]
*  And once Biden took over, he didn't sign any federal land leases till like the last three months of his presidency. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=895.8199999999999s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=903.62s)]
*  So when you make, you know, I made a good wage and got taken care of. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=905.62s)]
*  It's funny because you drive a Tesla. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=910.62s)]
*  Actually, I have to rent. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=912.92s)]
*  I work, I work 105 hours a week now. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=914.2199999999999s)]
*  And I rent this. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=918.3199999999999s)]
*  This is the only way I can survive. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=919.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=921.22s)]
*  Yeah, I work 715s. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=922.22s)]
*  So why, wait, why did you, so why, why did you rent a Tesla? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=924.02s)]
*  Because there's no maintenance on it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=927.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=929.22s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=930.72s)]
*  I mean tires and windshield wipers are fluid. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=932.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=934.52s)]
*  I mean, I started off with my Nissan Murano, but I put a hundred and, a hundred and fourteen thousand miles in 11 months on it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=934.92s)]
*  And then you're talking about within that, you're talking oil changes about every 10 to 12 days. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=941.92s)]
*  You're talking transmission services and all that. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=949.22s)]
*  Every time you do that, like the oil changes two hours for me. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=953.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=957.22s)]
*  By the time I go drive there and get it done, get back. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=957.42s)]
*  But that's two hours I lose working. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=959.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=961.72s)]
*  So this, I have none. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=962.72s)]
*  Yeah, no, for sure. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=965.22s)]
*  About every 60,000 miles I'll get new tires. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=966.12s)]
*  Plus is, plus is a rent. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=968.52s)]
*  You said you rent this. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=970.02s)]
*  So I guess like worst case, the only, the only downside from what I understand is that like if something goes wrong in a Tesla, it just like kind [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=971.52s)]
*  of bricks the car. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=979.02s)]
*  So you have to just like send it in and you have to wait a long period of time to get it back. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=979.8199999999999s)]
*  But since you're renting it, you just like rent another. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=982.8199999999999s)]
*  I assume. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=984.92s)]
*  Well, if something happens, I just get a new car. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=985.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=987.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=987.8199999999999s)]
*  No, and that's one of the nice things I've never had that. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=988.52s)]
*  I've never had that happen yet. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=993.42s)]
*  I mean, I've had, I've had to switch in cars. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=994.92s)]
*  Like I got almost a hundred and sixty one thousand miles on this, man. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=997.02s)]
*  You know, I'll drive the crap out of this thing till it's done. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1001.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1003.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1004.22s)]
*  Yeah, I got a, I got an EV2 for my, for my daily driving. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1007.4200000000001s)]
*  It's a, it's pretty, it's pretty easy. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1013.32s)]
*  I'm not like a big car guy though. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1015.52s)]
*  So that's, that's why I don't really care. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1017.02s)]
*  Well, I think these are great for daily drivers. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1020.22s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1022.62s)]
*  If you like want to do like road trips and stuff. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1023.52s)]
*  Yeah, you can't. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1026.42s)]
*  It's a big headache. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1027.22s)]
*  I've done a couple little guys like seven, eight hour drives. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1028.02s)]
*  It just adds so much to the drive. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1031.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you got to like sit there, wait, have a charge. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1033.42s)]
*  But if you're just going to drive around your city or a few hours from your city, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1037.02s)]
*  I mean you can't beat them. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1041.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1043.72s)]
*  I mean, this is a lot. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1045.22s)]
*  You do a lot of driving though, because I mean in the Uber you're driving a lot. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1046.1200000000001s)]
*  Is charging a lot of issue in the, in Vegas? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1051.42s)]
*  There's a lot of fast chargers, right? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1054.3200000000002s)]
*  Superchargers are a lot of recall. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1055.72s)]
*  Yeah, superchargers. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1056.6200000000001s)]
*  That's still, it's still a kind of a pain, but I've got it used to like, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1057.22s)]
*  I will stop at lunchtime. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  Go charge and I'll go get lunch. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1063.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1065.72s)]
*  So I kind of combine my time together with that. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1066.02s)]
*  How long is the, how long is the supercharging? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1068.32s)]
*  How long does that take? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1072.12s)]
*  Typically about 40 minutes is an average. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1072.82s)]
*  Now in the summer it gets a lot longer and I have to charge more often. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1075.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, because you got the AC on. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1080.32s)]
*  No, not just the AC. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1082.4199999999998s)]
*  It's the, the, the car's trying to keep the battery at a temperature. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1083.4199999999998s)]
*  And so I'm fighting that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1088.02s)]
*  It's trying to keep it at a certain temperature. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1089.12s)]
*  I mean, we get to 120 degrees here. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1091.52s)]
*  True. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1093.92s)]
*  And that battery is just, the AC is, or the AC for that, it puts all the power to that first. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1094.32s)]
*  It's trying to save the battery. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1100.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1102.12s)]
*  And then whatever they got left is out here. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1102.62s)]
*  There's sometimes you'll be like, AC, but this is lukewarm at best. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1104.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1108.52s)]
*  And I feel like the more usage you have on the battery, the more the battery life is, is worse, right? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1110.02s)]
*  Like. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1117.52s)]
*  Yeah, it does go down, but you know, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1118.42s)]
*  60,000 on here. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1121.02s)]
*  This thing, full battery originally was about 290 miles is what it said. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1122.62s)]
*  And right now, even at full charge, it says it's like 250. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1129.52s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1134.92s)]
*  260. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1135.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't ever pay attention to miles. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1136.52s)]
*  I always, my percentages are more important to me. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1138.52s)]
*  Have you ever seen the crazy stuff that they, they're doing in China? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1141.02s)]
*  They got like, they got cars now. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1144.32s)]
*  They just like roll up. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1146.72s)]
*  And then there's a platform that like raises the car a little bit and battery swaps it in a second. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1148.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1153.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, they've been talking about doing that here. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1153.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1155.52s)]
*  That would be kind of cool. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1156.22s)]
*  Something you can pull out and redo. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1157.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1159.92s)]
*  I think it's just like, it's probably too costly for us. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1160.52s)]
*  So we can't do it, you know. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1163.6200000000001s)]
*  They just got to figure out, they, they, what they got to do is they got some kind of, they got to get their transfer rates down. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1165.3200000000002s)]
*  They got to find a way to make, make it get into the battery quicker. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1171.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, that's one of the biggest problems with these is just the time it takes. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1176.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1181.4199999999998s)]
*  You probably have to redo all the cars too. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1182.12s)]
*  That's like, I suspect that that would be too costly. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1184.4199999999998s)]
*  We don't do that. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1189.32s)]
*  Hey, there's places in Germany now that are making the, putting recharges on the roads so they can recharge batteries when you drive over certain. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1190.82s)]
*  I've heard that too. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1199.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1200.82s)]
*  I think it was the Netherlands that they try to do that. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1201.02s)]
*  But I don't, I don't know how, I don't know how that works to be honest. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1203.42s)]
*  I don't know how like, how well that would work. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1206.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1209.52s)]
*  I don't know either. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1209.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1210.92s)]
*  How would that affect other vehicles on it? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1212.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1214.02s)]
*  It's like, I don't even understand how the iPhone charges when you put the MagSafe thing. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1217.42s)]
*  Like you put it on top of a thing and it charges the battery. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1223.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know how that works either. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1225.92s)]
*  It's magic. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1226.92s)]
*  So where are you guys coming from? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1228.6200000000001s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1231.3200000000002s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1232.02s)]
*  How long have you known about this rally? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1233.42s)]
*  How long ago was it announced? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1237.72s)]
*  Is it months ago? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1240.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, is it been planned for a while? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1241.8200000000002s)]
*  No, no, no, it wasn't. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1243.22s)]
*  It wasn't months ago. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1244.02s)]
*  No, it's recent. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1244.8200000000002s)]
*  Bernie decided, you know, he's taken it to the road like maybe a month ago and he's been going all around the country to different places. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1246.6200000000001s)]
*  Like he's in Nevada today for a couple hours and then flying out to Arizona. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1253.52s)]
*  He's doing one in Tucson. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1260.3200000000002s)]
*  Tomorrow he's doing one in Denver. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1261.62s)]
*  So he's going all around. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1263.9199999999998s)]
*  He first did the East Coast. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1266.52s)]
*  Now he's doing like, you know, the West Coast up and down the West Coast. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1267.52s)]
*  Trying to try to get trying to get people to, you know, be a little bit more agitated about all the things that are going on. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1276.12s)]
*  Trump did it too. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1288.62s)]
*  So, yeah, well Trump, they were the Republicans talk to everybody, mainly the podcasts. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1290.52s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the thing is you're a big podcast fan. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1301.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1304.62s)]
*  Who do you watch? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1305.82s)]
*  A lot of you watch Theo Von. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1306.62s)]
*  I have yeah. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1310.82s)]
*  Yeah, I was on Theo Von. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1312.62s)]
*  Maybe you saw it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1315.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1315.92s)]
*  Yeah, I was after Candace Owens. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1316.82s)]
*  Okay, I'll look it up. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1319.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, but sandwich between Candace Owens and what's the guy from Righteous Gemstones? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1320.32s)]
*  Yeah, he's a cool dude. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1327.4199999999998s)]
*  No, I see like they even Rogan offered Kamala and Biden to come on there. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1332.62s)]
*  Yeah, but they just wouldn't do it. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1339.62s)]
*  I what was it? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1341.9199999999998s)]
*  I forget what it was, but like I think she should have done it. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1343.32s)]
*  Yeah, it was a big mistake. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1346.32s)]
*  Well, the problem is with her she she was all scripted. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1348.3200000000002s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1351.22s)]
*  You can't she can't sit there and talk by herself for three hours. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1351.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, she's really good if she's got a script in front of her. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1356.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't even think she's really good when she's got a script in front of her. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1359.42s)]
*  Sorry, she was better with a script in front of her. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1362.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, there's there's definitely a crisis of how disingenuous a lot of Democrats seem on camera for sure. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1365.02s)]
*  I think overall though, I mean, it's also policies like they don't they don't have any discernible policies. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1374.52s)]
*  So then they can be humiliated by the Republicans. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1380.82s)]
*  So regularly they'll say like, oh you care about here. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1384.42s)]
*  I'll give you an example like the ads about offering bottom surgery to transgender undocumented migrants, right? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1388.22s)]
*  Like that was like a big thing, you know, is you laugh but like that that was happening under the Trump administration, too. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1397.02s)]
*  It's just like such a minor part that no one ever even focuses on. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1402.82s)]
*  It's like a normal it's a normal part of the process. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1406.32s)]
*  Except when Kamala didn't have any like discernible policies you could point to then that's the only thing the Republicans point to then people are going to be like, oh, yeah, that's all she cares about. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1409.52s)]
*  That's all she stands for. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1419.52s)]
*  Well, the whole thing about I think the big Democrats really lost it when two things they went after the kids. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1420.9199999999998s)]
*  And they couldn't even tell people what a woman was. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1429.62s)]
*  I mean that kind of stuff is I think that kind of stuff is just distraction. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1433.12s)]
*  It's distraction by the Republicans really like where they're like they constantly they constantly talk about this stuff. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1438.62s)]
*  But is that putting is that putting food on your table? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1444.4199999999998s)]
*  Is that putting money in your pocket? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1446.7199999999998s)]
*  No, how would you feel if your kid goes to school and he leaves and comes back as a girl and you had no control over it? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1449.32s)]
*  I don't think that's how it works. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1456.7199999999998s)]
*  Well, no, they would they would actually talk to the children about their what they thought, you know, and they could actually get in the you know, it's not exactly. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1457.92s)]
*  It's not exactly how that works. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1467.8200000000002s)]
*  It's just like it's like the gay stuff in the 90s, right? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1469.02s)]
*  Like when there was an initiative to be more open minded towards gay people schools would schools would also be more open minded towards gay people to make sure that there wasn't like bullying or you know, because there's like a big teenage suicide [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1473.72s)]
*  crisis happening in America to like in order to avoid that sort of stuff. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1487.4199999999998s)]
*  But they're not like trans in the children. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1491.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1494.4199999999998s)]
*  You don't like turn trans the same as same as being gay. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1494.9199999999998s)]
*  If you want to I don't care what you do behind your door. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1498.62s)]
*  I really don't you want to be whatever do it. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1501.32s)]
*  I really don't care as long as you're not hurting anybody else. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1504.32s)]
*  Exactly or some, you know, I don't care. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1507.9199999999998s)]
*  But here I'll tell you I'll tell you this much right. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1510.82s)]
*  There's a what do you think the number of like Trump did this thing with trans athletes, right? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1512.62s)]
*  I think this is it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1518.82s)]
*  Yeah, this is yeah, this is where this is where it's taken. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1519.82s)]
*  Yeah, do you happen to know where the amphitheater is? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1523.12s)]
*  No, no, we'll figure it out. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1525.82s)]
*  We'll figure it out. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1528.32s)]
*  But yeah, last thing I was going to say is Trump's whole thing with trans athletes, you know, you know the number of trans athletes. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1529.52s)]
*  I know. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1537.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's 49. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1538.32s)]
*  I just remember seeing like what's your name get beat by a male on the I know they're going to see the boxer get punched and it's like, yeah. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1541.12s)]
*  Well, that's the thing is just that is a distraction. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1547.82s)]
*  It's just like it's the Republican method of being like we're not going to do shit that actually puts more money in your pocket. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1550.22s)]
*  So just focus on this. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1556.62s)]
*  I have a good one, sir. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1558.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1560.32s)]

*  You too. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1563.82s)]
*  Let me text the. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1572.02s)]
*  The camera being used with your package streaming 4K TVU doesn't downscale. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1579.52s)]
*  So streaming 4K out is it a Sony? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1583.52s)]
*  What was all that? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1587.52s)]
*  That was cool. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1592.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1594.52s)]
*  In your settings, you have to change the HDMI output resolution to 1080. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1596.02s)]
*  That's what Taylor is saying. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1600.02s)]
*  Is it fucked up right now? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1601.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1602.52s)]
*  It's probably eating up more bandwidth than necessary. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1604.02s)]
*  That's why he's saying like fix it. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1606.52s)]
*  Oh, this is fine though. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1608.02s)]
*  I think it already is to 1080. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1612.52s)]
*  Yeah, but in both the HDMI resolution settings and then in the menu under it HDMI output settings, you got to change it to 1080. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1614.02s)]
*  I was about to defend Kamala with his life. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1629.52s)]
*  Is it f-ing? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1637.52s)]
*  Oh, it f-ed, I think. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1638.52s)]
*  It's back. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1639.52s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1640.52s)]
*  It's it after it's back now. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1641.52s)]
*  Sorry for the shaky. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1643.52s)]

*  Whoops, that's awkward. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1724.52s)]

*  Mark, you got to let me see the knife. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1832.52s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1835.52s)]
*  You get a lot of good use out of that? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1837.52s)]
*  Not as much as I probably should for how much I spend on it. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1839.52s)]
*  I mean, it looks cool. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1842.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1843.52s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1844.52s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1845.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1846.52s)]
*  How was your travel in? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1848.52s)]
*  It's great. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1849.52s)]
*  I mean, it's super simple. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1850.52s)]
*  One hour, half an hour flight, basically. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1851.52s)]
*  Driving over here, we had a wonderful conversation with an Uber driver who was talking about Trans-Sesame Street [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1855.52s)]
*  and how much the federal government is a waste of money. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1865.52s)]
*  I don't know how to respond to that. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1869.52s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1872.52s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1873.52s)]
*  That's all I respond to. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1874.52s)]
*  It was like, hell yeah, brother. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1875.52s)]
*  You're right. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1877.52s)]
*  I love you a lot. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1878.52s)]
*  You can do that. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1879.52s)]
*  I feel like if I do that, I'm going to get in trouble with my boss. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1880.52s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1883.52s)]
*  If someone finds out. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1884.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1885.52s)]
*  I'm still going to do it, but you know. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1886.52s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1888.52s)]
*  So, oh, you said we're waiting for someone else? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1890.52s)]
*  Yeah, just waiting for the Bernie livestream guy who said he's walking over right now. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1892.52s)]
*  Wait, Bernie has a livestream guy? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1898.52s)]
*  Of course Bernie has a livestream guy. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1899.52s)]
*  Bernie has a marketing. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1901.52s)]
*  Bernie's a Twitch streamer. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1902.52s)]
*  That's why we're doing this interview. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1903.52s)]
*  We're going to talk to him about Twitch streaming. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1904.52s)]
*  Well, he's not full time with Bernie anymore. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1906.52s)]
*  He's the whole old campaign crew. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1908.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1910.52s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1911.52s)]
*  Hey, what's up? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1914.52s)]
*  Bringing the gang back together. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1915.52s)]
*  One last hurrah. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1917.52s)]
*  Yeah, just come back to the time. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1919.52s)]
*  Wait, Oliver is calling. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1923.52s)]
*  Hey, what's up? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1925.52s)]
*  Actually, I'm inside the gate in the backstage right now, but we're waiting. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1926.52s)]
*  Oh, we're moving now. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1930.52s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1932.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1933.52s)]
*  Oh, you're right there. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1934.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1935.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1939.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1940.52s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1941.52s)]
*  Welcome to the Murriachi Band. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1943.52s)]
*  What up? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1947.52s)]
*  So from what I understand, this rally is going to be a little bit smaller than the normal [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1952.52s)]
*  Bernie rallies that they do. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1957.52s)]
*  The ones in Denver is going to be like 22,000 people, I think. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1959.52s)]
*  Like, insane. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1964.52s)]
*  This is a relatively small one, but it was the one that I, it was the one that was the [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1965.52s)]
*  easiest for us to just like fly into and that they have like a little bit of time to talk [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1971.52s)]
*  to us. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1975.52s)]
*  So that's why we came to this one rather than going all, going to Denver or any of the other [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1976.52s)]
*  places. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1982.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1983.52s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1984.52s)]
*  We're live already. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1985.52s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1986.52s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1987.52s)]
*  Thanks for coming out. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1988.52s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1989.52s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1990.52s)]
*  Oh, we're going to talk over there, right? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1991.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1992.52s)]
*  Oh, perfect. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1993.52s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1994.52s)]
*  Look at this line. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=1995.52s)]
*  How big is this rally in comparison to the other ones? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2004.52s)]
*  I think Denver will be the biggest one. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2006.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2010.52s)]
*  This was actually going to be really big. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2011.52s)]
*  I think we are just burning 20, 20 of that. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2015.52s)]
*  We've got some people in Vegas. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2018.52s)]
*  So we'll see how it goes out today. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2019.52s)]
*  It's great. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2022.52s)]
*  Crowd so far for midday. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2023.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2024.52s)]
*  Oh, midday too. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2025.52s)]

*  Oh. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2059.52s)]
*  It's too big, so we have to move a little bit. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2060.52s)]
*  So we have this spot where we have space in the hall too, which is a little potentially [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2061.52s)]
*  quieter. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2062.52s)]

*  We can just do it here. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2078.52s)]
*  Actually, one thing, if you have it, no big deal if you don't, but just take a basic light [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2079.52s)]
*  stand or a tiny tripod. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2083.56s)]
*  I can pop this on. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2085.48s)]
*  Or even just a chair I can extend this onto to get eye level when they're sitting. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2086.6s)]
*  I definitely have a chair. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2091.48s)]
*  I could even use this, honestly. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2092.48s)]
*  Something... [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2095.48s)]
*  Or that table would be perfect. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2096.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2098.48s)]
*  Well, that's for... [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2099.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2100.48s)]
*  I meant light stand out C stand. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2101.48s)]
*  I don't even think he was putting that up for me. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2102.48s)]
*  Sorry for assuming that. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2105.24s)]
*  I think he was. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2106.24s)]
*  No, he wasn't. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2107.9599999999996s)]
*  He had a van burn? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2108.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2110.9599999999996s)]
*  Well, hopefully. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2111.9599999999996s)]
*  We'll see if he has time. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2112.9599999999996s)]
*  He's just... [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2113.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't know if he's even laying it down. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2114.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2117.9599999999996s)]
*  Busy guy. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2118.9599999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2119.9599999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2120.9599999999996s)]
*  We'll be here. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2121.9599999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2122.9599999999996s)]
*  Do you think table about that height is something? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2123.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2126.9599999999996s)]
*  I think that table would probably work. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2127.9599999999996s)]
*  We could just pop it over here. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2128.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2129.9599999999996s)]
*  Also, there is one. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2130.9599999999996s)]
*  Look. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2131.9599999999996s)]
*  Oh, that doesn't have a... [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2132.9599999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2133.9599999999996s)]
*  And they're probably using that for something else. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2135.68s)]
*  What are you guys doing here? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2138.68s)]
*  I'm doing an interview for PBS with Bernie. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2139.68s)]

*  And yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2147.96s)]
*  These lights aren't going to do shit. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2148.96s)]
*  I like this. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2149.96s)]
*  Nope. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2150.96s)]
*  At the time we're going to do it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2151.96s)]
*  This one's going to be great back there. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2152.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2154.96s)]
*  But it looks good, I guess. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2155.96s)]
*  Hey. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2158.96s)]
*  I say that shit all the time. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2159.96s)]
*  Look. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2160.96s)]
*  We... [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2161.96s)]
*  Do what you can. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2162.96s)]
*  We're significantly less professional than yours. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2163.96s)]
*  And we're kind of stealing your... [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2165.96s)]
*  We're kind of stealing your shit right now, as a matter of fact. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2167.96s)]
*  I think I'm going to move the... [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2176.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2178.96s)]
*  I mean, if you want a manny camera, I can move things too. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2179.96s)]
*  Which side is better? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2182.96s)]
*  This angle or the other? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2184.96s)]
*  Oh, I have the ND filter so we can shoot out. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2185.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2187.96s)]
*  Can I move your jacket? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2189.96s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2190.96s)]
*  I'll get all this shit out of here. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2192.96s)]
*  We can steal your chairs, right? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2194.96s)]
*  Like, that's fine. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2196.96s)]
*  Because we're going to do it right now. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2197.96s)]
*  Yeah, I have the plastic go. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2198.96s)]
*  What? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2199.96s)]
*  Do you need to use the chair or what? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2200.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2201.96s)]

*  Cool. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2205.96s)]
*  Let me see how that looks. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2206.96s)]
*  We got it. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2208.96s)]
*  20 minutes. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2209.96s)]
*  That's shit. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2213.96s)]
*  This will work. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2215.96s)]
*  It might still look cool in the wide shot, at least. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2217.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2219.96s)]

*  Totally. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2221.96s)]
*  A meta shot. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2222.96s)]
*  I love that, personally. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2223.96s)]
*  Do you think it's good? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2226.96s)]
*  Do you need help? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2227.96s)]
*  You want to punch it in? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2228.96s)]
*  Where do you want to put it? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2229.96s)]
*  Yeah, like, literally right there. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2230.96s)]
*  And then we can scoot the chairs a bit closer together. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2231.96s)]
*  Here, sit in for me. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2241.96s)]
*  I mean, we still have time, but... [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2244.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2246.96s)]
*  Dirty as hell. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2251.96s)]
*  We'll rearrange these chairs a bit. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2268.96s)]
*  Do you have tape if you want to mark them, if we move them? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2275.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's good to do that. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2278.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2279.96s)]
*  It gets both? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2285.96s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2287.96s)]
*  It's wide enough? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2288.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2289.96s)]
*  If anything, it's just a little off-center, but that's fine. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2291.96s)]
*  It's supposed to be... [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2300.96s)]
*  I would say if we want to do it, it would be like angled towards camera, kind of. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2309.96s)]
*  Do you mind if I arrange this a bit? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2316.96s)]
*  He already placed the marker, so it's good. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2318.96s)]
*  Like this. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2321.96s)]
*  And then plug your phone so you can see how it looks right now. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2325.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2327.96s)]
*  And we can just do something like... [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2328.96s)]
*  It's a little bit blown onto the top, but it's not the end of the world. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2330.96s)]
*  I can adjust, for sure. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2333.96s)]
*  Yeah, this seems great. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2338.96s)]
*  It's backlit. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2354.96s)]
*  You guys don't know anything, okay, chat? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2355.96s)]
*  Don't even act like... [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2357.96s)]
*  We got real professionals here. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2361.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, this is live right now. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2363.96s)]
*  This is live right now. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2365.96s)]
*  There's 42,000 people watching you at this very moment. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2366.96s)]
*  For the record, I'm not putting the camera on you. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2370.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2372.96s)]
*  Not to freak you out. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2373.96s)]
*  PBS will see this. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2375.96s)]
*  At least something. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2379.96s)]
*  Good scene. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2381.96s)]
*  No, I... [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2382.96s)]
*  You know, I watch all the time. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2384.96s)]
*  I love it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2386.96s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2389.96s)]
*  I'm keeping it alive. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2390.96s)]
*  Nice, I've been doing so much true crime shit lately. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2392.96s)]
*  It's something meaningful. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2394.96s)]
*  True crime pays the bills, though. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2399.96s)]
*  People love true crime. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2401.96s)]
*  True crime train. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2402.96s)]
*  White ladies love true crime. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2403.96s)]
*  You need to switch the table? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2410.96s)]
*  What? Why? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2412.96s)]
*  They want it to be facing this way, but... [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2414.96s)]
*  It's so boring, though. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2417.96s)]
*  I mean, the thing is, if it wasn't for this filter, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2423.96s)]
*  this wouldn't even be an option. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2426.96s)]
*  We would have to shoot that way. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2427.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2429.96s)]
*  The backdrop the other way around is boring, Chet. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2430.96s)]
*  The backdrop the other way around is very boring. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2437.96s)]
*  Also, with the lighting, it actually does look fine. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2440.96s)]
*  Yeah, it helps a lot. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2442.96s)]
*  Oh, it's auto-adjusting a little bit, but... [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2443.96s)]
*  I did that. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2447.96s)]
*  Oh, you did that, okay. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2449.96s)]
*  Trying to put it in the right spot. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2450.96s)]
*  Or like right there. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2452.96s)]
*  I mean, I'll write it and check it while it's going. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2453.96s)]
*  People saying it's super exposed, it's blinding, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2457.96s)]
*  but it's because you sit in a dark basement all day. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2460.96s)]
*  Oh, actually... [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2465.96s)]
*  You sit in a dark basement all day, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2467.96s)]
*  and all of a sudden you're like, there's sunlight. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2468.96s)]
*  It hurts my eyes. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2470.96s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2472.96s)]
*  It should be a little better. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2473.96s)]
*  The thing is, the exposure on the monitor [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2483.96s)]
*  is not the same as the exposure that you get on... [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2486.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2488.96s)]
*  For some reason it's brighter on Twitch than what you see over here. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2489.96s)]
*  So I just have to compensate for that. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2492.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a little better. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2494.96s)]
*  It's a little better. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2496.96s)]
*  It's a little better. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2497.96s)]
*  It's a little better. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2498.96s)]
*  So this is what you see over here. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2499.96s)]
*  So I just have to compensate for that. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2500.96s)]
*  Yeah, just like making it darker, I guess. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2502.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2504.96s)]
*  They're saying it's good they're pogging. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2509.96s)]
*  Chat overlay. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2516.96s)]
*  Like right here. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2518.96s)]
*  How do I... [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2524.96s)]
*  How do I hide the chat? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2525.96s)]
*  I don't want to see the chat. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2527.96s)]
*  I think this looks good. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2532.96s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2533.96s)]
*  At least mine two cents. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2537.96s)]
*  What did the professional say he said? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2540.96s)]
*  Good enough. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2542.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2543.96s)]
*  Good enough for government work. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2546.96s)]
*  That's the meta. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2548.96s)]
*  That's what you gotta say. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2549.96s)]
*  Look, less exposed than Fox News interviewing the president. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2550.96s)]
*  That's true. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2553.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2554.96s)]
*  That's... [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2556.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2557.96s)]
*  I just cooked Laura Ingraham's camera operator for no reason. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2558.96s)]
*  And then here we are having a similar predicament. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2562.96s)]
*  A little dark, not gonna lie. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2569.96s)]
*  That chatter's vindicated. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2570.96s)]
*  I think there's also auto exposure on it, right? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2571.96s)]
*  Did you put it on auto exposure? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2574.96s)]
*  I mean, it is, but it's not changing right now. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2575.96s)]
*  Because when I move around, it kind of changes. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2577.96s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2580.96s)]
*  But it's all good. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2581.96s)]
*  All right, so chatters, what we're going to be doing is first, we're going to talk to AOC. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2583.96s)]
*  And then if time permits, we're going to have Bernard come on as well. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2590.96s)]
*  And I think that there will be some time, but they're both running a little late. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2595.96s)]
*  Normally we were supposed to start at 12 on the dot, but it actually worked out in our favor that they were a little late because... [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2600.96s)]
*  I'm adjusting it. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2611.96s)]
*  Whoa, it is dark as hell. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2612.96s)]
*  I'm just chill. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2614.96s)]
*  I'm freaking out. It's dark. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2615.96s)]
*  Chad, stop freaking out. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2616.96s)]
*  Your faces are a little dark and the background is kind of bright. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2619.96s)]
*  Don't think you can do much about it. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2622.96s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2623.96s)]
*  I mean, he's blasting me with these, so... [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2624.96s)]
*  Something's going to be very different. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2630.96s)]
*  Are you getting the AOC before the rally? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2633.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2635.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing it now. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2636.96s)]
*  AOC stuck in a MAGA Uber? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2638.96s)]
*  Probably. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2639.96s)]
*  Probably. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2641.96s)]
*  What was it? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2642.96s)]
*  DNC? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2643.96s)]
*  She was motorcade? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2644.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2645.96s)]
*  We were supposed to do an in-person at DNC and we couldn't because she was stuck behind the motorcade. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2646.96s)]
*  The chair is fucked? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2656.96s)]
*  Dude, that's the better chair. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2657.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2660.96s)]
*  This one was dusty as hell. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2661.96s)]
*  I put my... [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2663.96s)]
*  I put my... [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2664.96s)]
*  This one was dusty as hell. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2665.96s)]
*  I put my ass on this so that we could clean it up for future interviews. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2667.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2680.96s)]
*  All right, this works. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2687.96s)]
*  I'm happy with this. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2688.96s)]
*  Suck me, Chad. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2691.96s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2692.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2693.96s)]
*  I'm the fucking producer, not you. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2694.96s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2699.96s)]
*  The guy behind the camera is giving us a nod of approval. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2701.96s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2704.96s)]
*  That's two professionals against two. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2705.96s)]

*  Honestly, if you want to juice these, yeah. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2710.96s)]
*  Pretty max juiced right now. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2712.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2713.96s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2714.96s)]
*  I mean, that's fine. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2716.96s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2718.96s)]
*  Light is in the shot now, by the way, March. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2725.96s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2728.96s)]
*  I figured. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2729.96s)]
*  Not that one, this one. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2730.96s)]
*  But it's fine. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2731.96s)]
*  We'll fix it. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2732.96s)]
*  I don't know why your face is lit perfectly, but mine is dark. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2736.96s)]
*  And I don't know what that is. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2741.96s)]
*  Maybe if I scoot closer. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2743.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2749.96s)]

*  You're going to maybe do it in there. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2776.96s)]
*  No, no, this is perfect. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2778.96s)]
*  We like the amphitheater background. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2779.96s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2781.96s)]

*  And then are you all set up? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2785.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to run back to the podium now. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2786.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2787.96s)]
*  Do I have a volunteer that can show me? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2788.96s)]
*  Yes, the three. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2789.96s)]
*  Who's doing the three? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2790.96s)]
*  Okay, you? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2791.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2792.96s)]
*  What's up? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2793.96s)]
*  PBS. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2794.96s)]
*  Who's doing the three? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2795.96s)]
*  Oh, that's me. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2796.96s)]
*  That's me. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2797.96s)]
*  Okay, so this is going to be the next step. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2798.96s)]
*  Hi. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2799.96s)]
*  Sabrina. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2800.96s)]

*  Sorry, is this me? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2802.96s)]
*  No, no, not at all. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2803.96s)]
*  We're just freestyling. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2804.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're just freestyling. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2805.96s)]
*  People like it. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2806.96s)]
*  They like seeing, you know, how the sausage is made. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2807.96s)]
*  Yeah, because I have glowing skin. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2812.96s)]
*  I didn't want to tell them that. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2813.96s)]
*  Nice to meet you, Dan. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2816.96s)]
*  See you soon. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2821.96s)]
*  Thank you, Dan. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2822.96s)]
*  Dan the man. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2823.96s)]
*  Dan actually came in so clutch. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2824.96s)]
*  I know. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2827.96s)]
*  Without him, we would be lost. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2828.96s)]
*  Rudderless. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2831.96s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2832.96s)]
*  I had that shit on. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2835.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of messed up that Marge is showing me up big time as always. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2837.96s)]
*  Thank you, Dan. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2845.96s)]
*  Yeah, fun PBS is right. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2847.96s)]
*  Fun PBS. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2850.96s)]
*  Sabrina's going to take me back over there. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2851.96s)]
*  And then how much time do you think I'm going to have? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2853.96s)]
*  Marge is styling on you? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2861.96s)]
*  I know, dude. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2862.96s)]
*  I know. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2863.96s)]
*  Why you got to bring that up? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2864.96s)]
*  I know. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2865.96s)]
*  When is he not styling on me? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2866.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think it will be alright. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2868.96s)]
*  It's the filter that's causing the dark spot? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2873.96s)]
*  Oh, you're good. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2878.96s)]
*  I think I know it. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2879.96s)]
*  Could be. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2880.96s)]
*  It's not the end of the world, I don't think. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2881.96s)]
*  Should I still cover my five minute slot? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2884.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2887.96s)]
*  PBS is funded by viewers like you. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2888.96s)]
*  Open app? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2892.96s)]
*  This one chatter is actually right. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2893.96s)]
*  This one guy is actually right. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2895.96s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2897.96s)]
*  What, the filter itself? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2898.96s)]
*  No, but the solution I know. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2899.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2904.96s)]
*  Marge gave... [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2908.96s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2909.96s)]
*  No, I fucked up. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2910.96s)]
*  I shouldn't have said anything. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2911.96s)]
*  Chad is going to ride on that collectively. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2912.96s)]
*  No, they're going to make it seem like they've been right all along, nonstop and forever. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2915.96s)]
*  Put your face up. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2920.96s)]
*  Like this. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2924.96s)]
*  My skin is still glowing compared to yours. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2925.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what it is. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2927.96s)]
*  That's a little better. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2929.96s)]
*  You see I actually have a skincare routine. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2930.96s)]
*  I'm 29, so... [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2934.96s)]
*  You're old. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2937.96s)]
*  You're old. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2938.96s)]
*  29 is pretty... [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2939.96s)]
*  You're up there, dude. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2941.96s)]
*  You're up there. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2943.96s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2945.96s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2947.96s)]
*  I can see us on clearly. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2952.96s)]
*  Marge is a vampire. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2953.96s)]
*  Keg W. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2954.96s)]
*  29 is basically dead, dude. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2955.96s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2957.96s)]
*  29. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2959.96s)]
*  So we're going to have to go darker in the camera than what's seen on Twitch. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2969.96s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2973.96s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2974.96s)]
*  We have loud mics, it'll be fine. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2975.96s)]
*  Thank you, though. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2977.96s)]
*  If Marge is washed out, then Bernie is flashbanged? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=2985.96s)]

*  Sorry, Chad, I tried. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3255.96s)]
*  The reason why... [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3256.96s)]
*  If it's good enough for PBS, it's good enough for us. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3257.96s)]
*  That is true. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3259.96s)]
*  Why are Chatters chirping? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3260.96s)]
*  Why are you listening to Chatters chirping? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3261.96s)]
*  You said production Andes are the most annoying, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3263.96s)]

*  Production Andes are the most annoying. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3269.96s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3270.96s)]
*  I forgot my first time working on sets when productions and shoots would run 30 minutes, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3273.96s)]
*  an hour late, just because people would be trying to hide a wire that nobody would ever [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3282.96s)]
*  give a fuck about or care about. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3286.96s)]
*  And that's when I realized I was like, not only am I not built from the same cloth as [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3287.96s)]
*  these production Andes, but I don't want to be. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3291.96s)]

*  I want to go pet the geese. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3302.96s)]
*  Can you pet geese? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3306.96s)]
*  Or are they violent? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3308.96s)]
*  Is geese violent? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3309.96s)]
*  Is this the kind of violent geese? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3310.96s)]
*  While we wait? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3314.96s)]
*  Oh, the mariachi band started. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3315.96s)]

*  Let's see. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3407.96s)]
*  Let's walk around. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3408.96s)]
*  This seems like a good idea. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3410.96s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3418.96s)]

*  It's a little peak. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3426.96s)]
*  Oh my God, it's so blown out. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3428.96s)]
*  You guys have no idea how bright it is in the middle of the goddamn day. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3430.96s)]
*  I'm doing the Lord's work out here. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3433.96s)]
*  They don't know how bright it is in the middle of the day [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3435.96s)]
*  because they don't go outside. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3437.96s)]
*  Clearly. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3440.96s)]
*  Okay, so is there a way to get there to talk to the people that are in line? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3444.96s)]
*  I think we're intentionally separated from them. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3452.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3455.96s)]
*  And we don't have escorts. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3458.96s)]
*  I mean, we could... [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3461.96s)]
*  That's a lot of people, yeah. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3463.96s)]

*  I can't. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3469.96s)]
*  It's too deep. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3470.96s)]
*  Kingdom come deliverance. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3471.96s)]
*  I can only walk up to a certain point in the pond. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3472.96s)]
*  Beyond it goes, oh, it's too deep. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3476.96s)]
*  Oh, it's too deep. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3481.96s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3485.96s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3487.96s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3488.96s)]
*  I'm going to text them and say... [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3491.96s)]
*  It'd be real terrible if one of these birds shat on us. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3505.96s)]
*  Go talk to the geese. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3510.96s)]
*  Okay, but what if it attacks me? [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3512.96s)]
*  I don't want to get banned on... [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3515.96s)]

*  Naya, I know you're watching. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3525.96s)]
*  Turn the stream off. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3526.96s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3528.96s)]
*  They're fighting each other. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3529.96s)]

*  Maybe we back away from this. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3534.96s)]
*  Maybe we don't fuck with the geese. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3536.96s)]
*  Because that... [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3539.96s)]

*  Good to meet you. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3676.96s)]
*  I'm like... [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3677.96s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3678.96s)]
*  Hi. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3679.96s)]
*  Can I get a picture with you? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3680.96s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3681.96s)]
*  We can do it over the fence. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3682.96s)]
*  I'll hold the bars like I'm picking friends. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3683.96s)]
*  Like you're in jail. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3684.96s)]
*  Love it. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3685.96s)]
*  All right. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3686.96s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3687.96s)]
*  No problem. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3688.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to do it in a little bit. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3689.96s)]
*  They're not here yet. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3691.6s)]
*  So, we're just trying to figure out what to do. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3692.6s)]
*  What are you looking forward to today? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3694.6s)]
*  Hopefully know Israel glazing. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3696.6s)]
*  That's true. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3699.6s)]
*  That's the number one thing. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3700.6s)]
*  I almost didn't come today. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3701.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3702.6s)]
*  I don't think he'll do that. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3703.6s)]
*  I don't think he's going to randomly bring up Israel and be like, Israel's great. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3704.6s)]
*  I love it. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3708.6s)]
*  It's the most moral nation. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3709.6s)]
*  I don't think he's... [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3710.6s)]
*  I don't think that's a part of his routine. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3711.6s)]
*  It's true. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3713.92s)]
*  It's true. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3714.92s)]
*  I think he did say after Israel broke the ceasefire that he was against it. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3715.92s)]
*  But still, I'm just so sick of all these democratic leaders saying that they are against the genocide [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3721.92s)]
*  and then just not being against it. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3728.92s)]
*  It's tiring. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3731.92s)]
*  With that said though, I love Bernie. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3733.92s)]
*  I'm so glad he's touring like this. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3735.92s)]
*  I mean, we're just in the throes of fascism, right? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3738.92s)]
*  And there's just... [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3741.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3742.92s)]
*  There's no better way to start fighting it than organizing, right? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3743.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3747.92s)]
*  Oh damn, she got the merch and everything. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3748.92s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3752.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3753.92s)]

*  What's up, guys? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3757.92s)]
*  I saw him in line in front of me and then I saw him on the stream and I was like, no [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3758.92s)]
*  shit. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3762.92s)]

*  This is a huge... [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3764.92s)]
*  So the first RTP I got for this... [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3765.92s)]
*  Can I show the pin? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3766.92s)]
*  It had hook? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3767.92s)]
*  Can I show the pin? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3768.92s)]
*  Yeah, she got a Hoss raid pin. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3769.92s)]
*  Can I take a picture? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3770.92s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3775.92s)]
*  Hi. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3776.92s)]
*  The first invite I got for this event was at a significantly smaller place and then [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3777.92s)]
*  I RSVP'd and then they sent me an email back and they were like, actually it's at this [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3783.92s)]
*  other place. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3786.92s)]
*  And I was like, that place is huge. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3787.92s)]
*  It was at the city of Las Vegas first. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3788.92s)]
*  I worked there. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3789.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3790.92s)]
*  It was 500, room for 500 and then the next day they had the... [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3791.92s)]
*  Yeah, and this is one of the smaller rallies. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3795.92s)]
*  The Denver one's going to have apparently like 20,000 people. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3798.92s)]

*  didn't know what was going on. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3915.92s)]

*  Because I grew up very, very conservative in a conservative family. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3926.92s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3929.92s)]

*  Uh-huh. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3933.92s)]
*  So I got the biggest tattoos all over me, actually, and I don't think about it. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3934.92s)]
*  But yeah, I'm just excited to hear what they have to say about, you know, everything going [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3937.92s)]
*  on and getting a different perspective since I feel like I've only heard one my whole life. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3941.92s)]
*  So. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=3946.92s)]

*  I saw it on your Twitter account. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4165.28s)]
*  And I was like, Craig Ranch, that's right here. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4168.44s)]
*  Literally, I'm 10 minutes away. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4170.88s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4172.0s)]
*  I got out of line, so I don't know if I'll come back into it. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4173.0s)]
*  I honestly just came here to see you for sure. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4175.4s)]
*  No, definitely go listen to the speeches. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4177.16s)]

*  We might have to dip. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4182.72s)]

*  Let's see. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4189.04s)]
*  The ND filter on the lens could do with being adjusted. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4191.04s)]
*  It's causing there to be a dark corner in the top left. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4195.84s)]
*  If it persists, you can consider getting a higher quality filter. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4197.64s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4200.04s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4201.04s)]

*  All right, take care, guys. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4370.92s)]
*  Are they coming? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4372.92s)]
*  Probably any minute now, yeah. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4375.92s)]
*  Haven't gotten the word, but... [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4378.92s)]
*  We still need to set back up and all that. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4381.92s)]
*  I don't think we're going to have 30 minutes to talk at this point. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4395.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4400.92s)]

*  It's all good. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4406.92s)]
*  Dude, I'm starting to get thirsty. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4419.92s)]
*  I mean, once I set up the camera, I can run out and grab water and shit. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4422.92s)]
*  And I gotta pee, which I assume there's a bathroom in here somewhere. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4425.92s)]
*  I might actually look for that while you set up the camera. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4431.92s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to rub a piss mic real quick? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4434.92s)]
*  I'm going to piss mic it. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4436.92s)]
*  Here. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4438.92s)]
*  I see a car. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4439.92s)]
*  That might be them. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4440.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4441.92s)]
*  I'll conduct this interview if I have to. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4442.92s)]
*  One of us has to, chat. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4445.92s)]
*  Well, Hassan continues to do crowd work outside. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4449.92s)]
*  Don't worry. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4452.92s)]
*  I'll talk to the politicians. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4455.92s)]
*  I don't really want it anyway, I know. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4459.92s)]
*  Now I know it's blown out. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4462.92s)]
*  Please hold. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4478.92s)]
*  Stop freaking out, chat. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4492.92s)]
*  It's going to get darker. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4515.92s)]
*  Waiting. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4518.92s)]
*  Sorry, this is ASMR. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4520.92s)]
*  I'm like so focused. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4522.92s)]
*  I forgot I was live. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4524.92s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4526.92s)]
*  Glorp, glorp, glorp. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4529.92s)]
*  Why are you guys typing that? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4532.92s)]
*  Waiting, waiting. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4535.92s)]
*  It's hot out here. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4537.92s)]
*  It's so hot. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4539.92s)]
*  Waiting, waiting. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4541.92s)]
*  It's hot out here standing in the sun. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4544.92s)]
*  Okay, let's see how this looks tilted. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4546.92s)]
*  I'm going to... [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4548.92s)]
*  I'm going to thank you for putting that out because you're right. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4556.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4571.92s)]
*  It's looking pretty good. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4576.92s)]
*  Oh, you're back. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4583.92s)]
*  Yeah, the bathroom's right there. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4585.92s)]
*  Nice. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4587.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't have to go. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4588.92s)]
*  It's good to know. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4590.92s)]
*  Go ahead and take a seat, champ. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4593.92s)]
*  The tape, the tape. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4596.92s)]
*  Why are they saying the tape? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4597.92s)]
*  I didn't even notice that. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4600.92s)]
*  Oh, the gaff tape. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4603.92s)]
*  If only we had that Bernie Sanders presidency and expanded broadband. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4605.92s)]
*  But here we are, nevertheless. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4617.92s)]
*  Gonzo streaming. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4623.92s)]
*  Fearing streaming in Las Vegas. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4625.92s)]
*  Yeah, we just got to do more drugs. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4628.92s)]
*  Well... [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4631.92s)]
*  Yeah, we do need to both do that. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4633.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think you do enough for both of us, actually, now that I think about it. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4635.92s)]
*  Don't know what you're talking about. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4639.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4641.92s)]
*  What is happening with my freaking internet? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4642.92s)]
*  Why isn't it working? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4645.92s)]
*  Do you have service? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4656.92s)]
*  Yeah, chilling. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4658.92s)]
*  Why am I not getting any service? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4660.92s)]
*  It's good. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4663.92s)]
*  They're almost here. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4665.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4666.92s)]
*  How much time are we going to have? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4667.92s)]
*  Are they pushing back the speaking? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4669.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4672.92s)]

*  Is there more people than expected? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4677.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4681.92s)]
*  I don't know how you can wear it, but I'll check. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4682.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4684.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4685.92s)]
*  I hear the music of my people. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4701.92s)]
*  Do you guys hear the mariachi band off in the distance? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4704.92s)]
*  March interview time. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4709.92s)]
*  That's right. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4711.92s)]
*  March what review? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4714.92s)]
*  Mariachi review? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4715.92s)]
*  March interview time. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4716.92s)]
*  Bro, we should get... [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4717.92s)]
*  We should start a podcast. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4719.92s)]
*  Yeah, that seems like a good idea. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4720.92s)]
*  Maybe get a couple more people in here, though. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4722.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4724.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4726.92s)]
*  A couple more people. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4729.92s)]
*  I should probably take the Eva jacket from behind me. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4730.92s)]
*  Why? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4734.92s)]
*  Because it just looks weird. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4735.92s)]
*  It might be... [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4738.92s)]
*  I thought it... [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4739.92s)]
*  I mean, it... [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4740.92s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4746.92s)]
*  All right, never mind. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4747.92s)]
*  I'll keep it. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4748.92s)]
*  You know what I want? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4750.92s)]
*  I want some dank-ass Mexican food. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4751.92s)]
*  That's what I want. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4753.92s)]
*  Maybe hit that taco truck up afterwards. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4755.92s)]
*  I had chilaquiles while you were streaming. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4757.92s)]
*  Oof. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4759.92s)]
*  Chilaquiles. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4760.92s)]
*  With some steak and a fried egg. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4761.92s)]
*  Nice. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4763.92s)]
*  And I did charge it to the room. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4764.92s)]
*  You did? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4766.92s)]

*  It's what he would have wanted. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4823.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's true. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4824.92s)]
*  It is. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4828.92s)]
*  It always is. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4829.92s)]
*  Is this when he tells you you pay for Japan out of the Hassan pile money? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4831.92s)]
*  March. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4837.92s)]
*  Only for the days you were there. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4839.92s)]
*  Not for the extensions. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4842.92s)]
*  It turns out I did pay for it. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4843.92s)]
*  I didn't even know. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4845.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4847.92s)]
*  One fucker's like, I was there for 25 days actually and you paid. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4849.92s)]
*  You actually comped the whole month. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4853.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4855.92s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't even think about that. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4856.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't really give a shit. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4858.92s)]
*  No, only for days I work. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4860.92s)]
*  Whenever I do anything extension, it's out of pocket. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4864.92s)]
*  Tal Mitnick just DM'd me, the Israeli Conscientious Objector, and said that the other person that I interviewed in that [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4867.92s)]
*  Revisional interview that we did, Ella is, she is just sentenced to 30 days. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4888.92s)]
*  She's going to prison, Israeli prison. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4897.92s)]
*  She's in prison now. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4899.92s)]
*  She was just sentenced for 30 days for refusing to serve. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4900.92s)]
*  Ella posted a day ago, on my way to the arrest cell at the enlistment base, then to trial and prison for my refusal to enlist in the IOF. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4905.92s)]
*  Thank you for all the support. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4913.92s)]
*  See you on the other side. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4914.92s)]
*  Xoxo. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4915.92s)]
*  She is a part of Messer Vot. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4919.92s)]
*  Update, Ella has been sentenced to 30 days in military prison for the first time. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4921.92s)]
*  There's comrades out there, everywhere. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4930.92s)]
*  What a world we live in. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4939.92s)]
*  What a cruel world we live in. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4941.92s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4942.92s)]
*  Why is my chat not working? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4948.92s)]
*  Come on chat. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4949.92s)]
*  Figure it out. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4950.92s)]
*  What? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4951.92s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4952.92s)]
*  It's working now. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4953.92s)]
*  Am I going to lie? [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4954.92s)]
*  Dude, I thought the punishment would be even worse. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4955.92s)]
*  No, it's a 30 day into, what? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4957.92s)]
*  Nothing, sorry. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4959.92s)]
*  It's a, so the way it works in Israel is, I mean, it's different for every single person depending on the country. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4960.92s)]
*  The severity of their quote unquote crime. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4967.92s)]
*  But basically it's 30 days and then they do an extension and they do another extension and it can go along for months. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4970.92s)]
*  Another part of countries with conscription, this is something that I've been doing for a long time. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4981.92s)]
*  And it can go along for, it can go along for months. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4988.92s)]
*  Another part of countries with conscription, this is something that Americans don't know, but this happens in Turkey as well, is that there's like, you don't, you can't get a job. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=4992.92s)]
*  Like there's no more gainful employment opportunities if you refuse to serve. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5002.92s)]
*  Or if you don't serve for one reason or another. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5006.92s)]
*  Unless you have a really good, unless you have a really good reason, if you don't serve in the military, in most of these countries, they just won't offer you a job. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5009.92s)]
*  There's like a lot of social stigma associated with it. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5018.92s)]
*  So it's not just, it's not just the prison sentence that can be lengthy. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5023.92s)]
*  Not like, you know, 10 years or whatever, but still lengthy for something as simple as like refusing to serve. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5031.92s)]
*  Because there are ways that you can get out of service in general. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5039.92s)]
*  Like there are conscientious objectors are making a political choice. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5043.92s)]
*  They are saying deliberately that I object to serving in the Israeli military. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5050.92s)]
*  And that comes with it a penalty. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5055.92s)]
*  Otherwise you could just like, I don't know, say that you have some sort of disability or try to get out of it with like other exemptions. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5058.92s)]
*  Like for me in Turkey, because I am a dual citizen and I worked in a foreign country, the United States of America for any set of period of time, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5069.92s)]
*  Turkey oftentimes offers pardons for not serving in the military. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5078.92s)]
*  And you can just, it's called off. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5083.92s)]
*  So you pay a fee basically ahead of time. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5086.92s)]
*  And if you pay that fee and you have the other qualifications, then you don't ever have to serve. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5091.92s)]
*  So I legally, I legally don't have to serve because I have dual citizenship and I worked overseas for an extended period of time. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5098.92s)]
*  Also, I need the pants ID please. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5113.92s)]
*  People don't like the pants. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5115.92s)]
*  They're complaining about it before. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5116.92s)]
*  They were like the jacket is sick, but the pants are, the pants are Y3. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5118.92s)]
*  Because you're rich, yes. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5122.92s)]
*  I think it was like $2,000, something along those lines that the fee I needed to pay to not serve. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5125.92s)]
*  There's also like if you go to college, you're, you're the length of your service in Turkey is shortened in comparison to if you are a high school graduate. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5133.92s)]
*  If you're a high school graduate, then you serve, I think like almost two years. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5144.92s)]
*  I don't know what the rules are now. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5147.92s)]
*  They probably changed it because they always change it. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5149.92s)]
*  $2,000 pants? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5153.92s)]
*  No, they're not $2,000 pants. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5154.92s)]
*  No, the pants are not $2,000 chat. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5157.92s)]
*  The fuck? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5159.92s)]
*  They're $10,000. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5160.92s)]
*  No, $2,000 is the cost of avoiding service. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5161.92s)]
*  The pants are $1 million. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5169.92s)]
*  $2,000 is the, the cost of not serving. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5176.92s)]
*  If you really cared about your fans, you would kiss them on the lips in front of everyone on the stream. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5182.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going to do that. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5186.92s)]
*  I guess I don't care about my fans. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5187.92s)]
*  MC Hammer garage sale. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5196.92s)]
*  Yeah, they're so comfy. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5197.92s)]
*  And they're, I think they're like, they're great because they're simultaneously cozy, but they also look like they're made of a material. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5199.92s)]
*  They're made of a material that makes them look more fancy than they are. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5211.92s)]
*  Do people in Turkey look down? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5218.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5220.92s)]
*  They're coming back with both Bernie and AOC. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5221.92s)]
*  Oh shit, we might need a third chair. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5223.92s)]
*  We didn't even think about this. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5226.92s)]
*  Oh, we didn't think about a third chair dynamic. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5228.92s)]
*  I'm going to give me your backpack. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5231.92s)]
*  Wait. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5233.92s)]
*  Okay, we need to. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5235.92s)]
*  So we need a third chair now. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5236.92s)]
*  We can grab some. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5238.92s)]
*  We have a bunch of these. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5239.92s)]
*  That's perfect. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5240.92s)]
*  A much nicer chair. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5241.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5242.92s)]
*  All right. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5243.92s)]
*  I'll set up the mics. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5244.92s)]
*  You set up the chairs. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5245.92s)]
*  Hassan. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5246.92s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5247.92s)]
*  We'll have them both facing this way and then I'll be on the right side. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVCYtk5Mk64&t=5248.92s)]
