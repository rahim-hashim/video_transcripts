# Medicaid Is OVER | HasánAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s)
*  No, they don't. No, they don't. You want to know why? Because the SEC is a carcass now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay. They don't even do that anymore because guess what? Donald Trump and the vultures [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=6.36s)]
*  that he brought into office gutted every institution, every regulatory body, including the SEC. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=12.5s)]
*  You're going to give me anxiety moving away from the vote like this, right? As the gap [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=25.68s)]
*  narrowed, dude, what did here? What anxiety? What, what do you, it's, it's over. Okay. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=28.56s)]
*  It's G G's G G no re you feel me here? We'll, we'll just tune into Fox news and here they [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=35.44s)]
*  were just barely hanging on that. They were really just trying to laboratory and then [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=42.2s)]
*  get to the party caucus. The freedom car, the freedom, 207 days, 209. The, the, the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=46.28s)]
*  Okay. So like, like we're just a few votes shy, seven votes of nine votes shy of that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=55.6s)]
*  magic number. Uh, we're doing the math in real time. We go into journalism so we don't [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=61.4s)]
*  have to do math. So I apologize if my counting is off, but the, uh, all indications here [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=65.04s)]
*  that speaker Johnson is still on track for the victory. I saw a white house. They just [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=69.4s)]
*  a minute ago walk by and I, you know, I've been bugging this guy all day and I've just [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=73.12s)]
*  said, you know, as cautiously optimistic as they can Sandra, but as speaker Johnson made [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=76.28s)]
*  it very clear, he was going to get this to the president's desk and ready for the president's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=84.06s)]
*  pen at any moment. Fair enough. We heard that confidence from him. Uh, we heard that confidence [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  from Kevin Hassett who advises the president on the economy at the white house top of the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=91.3s)]
*  hour. He said he's a hundred percent sure that this will go through. Uh, Mark Meredith, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=95.46s)]
*  we're watching the count 208 yeas now for the Republicans on the house floor. A couple [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=100.74s)]
*  of minutes left in voting. Trey Gowdy want to bring you back in here. Mark jump back [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=105.34s)]
*  in if you get a lawmaker who walks by you fresh off their vote. I will certainly welcome [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  their thoughts. Uh, but as far as the promise promises made by the Republicans, including [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=113.06s)]
*  what you just heard from the house speaker, uh, a few moments ago, the promises for economic [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  growth and prosperity that they are promising Americans will result from this bill. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  It won't. It'll shrink the GDP is what they're saying. So it's ironically not even [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=128.18s)]
*  economic prosperity on that end. Do we have a blast off name or what? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think the thing that we may not see is that the revenue actually, I mean, there [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=135.54s)]
*  are two ways to reduce the deficit. You can cut spending or you can increase revenue. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=140.54s)]
*  I don't know that you're going to see that much increase in revenue. The president is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=146.02s)]
*  trying to get manufacturing here. That's going to take a while. But in terms of your [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=149.86s)]
*  tax returns, the Republicans would be smart to send out a mailer and say, this is what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=153.74s)]
*  your tax returns would have been had the Democrats. So that's their best point. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=159.02s)]
*  Look at this kooky ass. Look at this haircut, bro. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=165.94s)]
*  The value of your life, but they do need to talk about safety. The number that matters [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=167.66s)]
*  there is the nine, not voting nine. Now they're in their offices, they're working their [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=172.18s)]
*  way over or they're on the phone with James Blair and the White House. Suzy, while saying, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=176.3s)]
*  okay, we lost this round. Can you help us with X in the future? But there's not a chance [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=181.94s)]
*  in the world. Mike Johnson is going to put this bill on the floor if he doesn't have [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=187.9s)]
*  the votes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, these guys are great vote counters. You don't put a bill on the floor unless you [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  know what's going to pass. That's the game on Capitol Hill. And you know, Trey, you talked [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=195.82s)]
*  a little bit about, you know what I just realized? Donald Trump wanted to cut Medicare or wanted [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=199.89999999999998s)]
*  to cut Medicaid and end Obama care. His first, his first time around. And it literally didn't [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  pass because of John McCain. And he hated John McCain every step of the way. And I just [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=213.42s)]
*  realized he it's over. Like they just passed, they just passed a bill that guts Medicaid [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=219.02s)]
*  in its entirety. It's done. It's over. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=227.9s)]
*  And South Carolina, if that's Ralph. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=232.46s)]
*  Okay, Trey, it's Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=235.02s)]
*  Who did vote against the procedural vote in the middle of the night as well. So that's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  Brian Fitzpatrick in a very moderate district. I believe President Biden won his district [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=242.78s)]
*  in 2024. But Trey, go ahead. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=247.82s)]
*  RIP to people who are on SNAP. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=249.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think the thing with the deficit, I mean, what drives our deficit and our debt's [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=252.06s)]
*  mandatory spending, and I've sat through many State of the Union addresses where it just [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=256.94s)]
*  didn't come up because it's not politically popular. I mean, Paul Ryan ran on entitlement [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=261.58s)]
*  reform and they, and they, and they ran ads with him pushing granny off a cliff in a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=267.26s)]
*  wheelchair. So everybody talks about debt and deficits, but it's much more popular to spend [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=271.58s)]
*  than to cut. So I don't until there is, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=277.18s)]
*  dude, he's talking about it. Like it's a, this is a fantastic accomplishment. He's like, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=280.62s)]
*  it's much more popular to spend than the cut. He's right, which is crazy. But he's literally [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=285.58s)]
*  talking about spend expenditures for people like life saving expenditures for people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=293.02s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder why it's more popular to fund these programs and to cut them, dude. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=298.78s)]
*  To your point, Eli. Yeah. Big NATO. I mean, it's a list of when Trump is preparing to put together. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=303.82s)]
*  I'm going to lose my mind. They're talking about this. Like it's a major W for Donald Trump. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=309.41999999999996s)]
*  God damn it. Oh my God. These people are so incredibly stupid. They are so dumb. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=313.26s)]
*  Everyone is so stupid. They just, Oh, another great victory for Donald Trump. Another he's, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=321.02s)]
*  is he becoming president? Is he president Trump? Now is he president Trump? Like, please just factor [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=327.9s)]
*  in the impact. Please just do impacts only going forward, please for the love of Christ. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=333.9s)]
*  And that is going to be a very big, visible kind of party for him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=339.34s)]
*  Right. And again, this is a guy who, I mean, this is the guy who yesterday went to alligator [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=346.14s)]
*  Alcatraz, right? This is a guy who knows how to brand and how to reach people and how to, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=350.06s)]
*  how to have a simple message, how to capture the public's imagination. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=354.62s)]
*  And he's going to be standing next to the troops and celebrating the troops who did that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=358.46s)]
*  He's going to be talking about a major legislative accomplishment for him and Republicans. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=363.74s)]
*  And those are really significant things again, down the road. We will see, right? A lot of the, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=368.86s)]
*  the deportations and the immigration stuff, you know, the ICE actions, those are not polling as [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=375.66s)]
*  though they appear to be all that popular. So if ICE gets supercharged and we see a lot more of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  those, and that's what's on voters mind, eight months from now, a year from now, we could be [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=385.5s)]
*  talking about a different story, right? You can celebrate anything at the bill signing. Joe Biden [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  had a lot of celebrations for bill signings too. Didn't mean he was, he ended up being able to, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=394.22s)]
*  or the Democrats ended up being able to hold onto the White House. And here we are. So I think, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=398.06s)]
*  you know, give the administration, the white house, the Republican party it's due because they do [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=402.14s)]
*  appear like they are going to get this to the finish line. And it has been a string of dude [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=406.3s)]
*  as they would say over the last week or two. Hey, thanks. There is a long way to go. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=411.82s)]
*  I fantastic, by the way, this Congressman representative, Robert Bresnahan sold his [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=416.7s)]
*  centine stock, dumped it. Okay. Sentine provides healthcare exchanges for Medicaid. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=423.97999999999996s)]
*  This Congressman literally dumps stock in a Medicaid provider company right before this bill [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=430.06s)]
*  came to the floor. Don't be fooled. These guys know exactly what they're doing. Now, before you [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=434.46s)]
*  say insider trading chat, it's worse than insider trading. Do you want to know why it's worse than [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=439.5s)]
*  insider trading? Because he's literally like, he has the capacity to make or break this as a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=446.86s)]
*  Congress person. Okay. It's not just that like, Oh, he knows that they have the votes for it. So [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=453.66s)]
*  this is the most opportune time to dump it. It's worse. It's market manipulation. When you think [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=459.34s)]
*  about it, the fact that Congress persons have the, the power to literally rig the market, like, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=464.38s)]
*  because they do, they have this power. They have the power to rig the market. Okay. It is market [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=473.82s)]
*  manipulation. It's not even like insider trading. It's like one step above. What's crazy is I saw a [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=479.41999999999996s)]
*  post on one of those stupid Twitter, like, you know, Wall Street bet style accounts where they [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=485.58s)]
*  were like, damn, I can't believe Trump predicted exactly the point of market recovery. And it had [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=491.82s)]
*  like a hundred thousand likes. And I didn't see anyone go, yeah, he didn't predict it. He caused [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=499.26s)]
*  it. Like it was showing the, it was showing the stock market dip and then Trump going by now, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=505.74s)]
*  this is the best time for you to buy. And then the stock market goes back on a, on a rally. Right. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  And now it's finally recovered back to the point it was at before Donald Trump talked about the, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=518.7s)]
*  the tariffs. And it's like, Oh, someone, Oh, thank God someone actually responded to it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=524.14s)]
*  Cause this is what I saw. And it's like, he literally called the bottom. And I was like, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=530.38s)]
*  yeah, I wonder why he called the bottom. Yep. Because he's the president. He didn't call the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=535.34s)]
*  bottom. He created the bottom. And then he literally tweaked the faucet that was making [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=541.66s)]
*  the market bottom out. And right before he tweaked the faucet, he said, great time to buy the, are [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=548.54s)]
*  these people that dumb? Are they this stupid? I guess the answer is yes. Thank God someone [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=554.62s)]
*  responded to his, wait, why does this have 32 K likes law? Of course he called the bottom. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=559.9s)]
*  He caused the bottom and then he decided to end it. Guy who single-handedly destroyed the economy [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=564.06s)]
*  tells everyone he is done destroying the economy. Anyone else does this in the SEC rails their brains [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=569.66s)]
*  out? No, they don't know. They don't. You want to know why? Because the SEC is a carcass now. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=574.62s)]
*  Okay. They don't even do that anymore because guess what? Donald Trump and the vultures that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=581.26s)]
*  he brought into office, gutted every institution, every regulatory body, including the sec like, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=587.3399999999999s)]
*  yes, in a functioning government, the sec is supposed to go, hold on. What do you mean? This [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=595.9000000000001s)]
*  is like all of this stuff is doesn't seem too legal to me. I think what's one of the, one of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=601.5s)]
*  the craziest parts about all of this is that like, there is an end shitification of government. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=607.9000000000001s)]

*  you know, in those competitive houses passed in the mid the house initially came out with deep cuts [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=651.74s)]
*  slammed it over to the Senate. The Senate literally added additional cuts that were even [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=656.94s)]
*  worse than the house's initial cuts. Then they passed it back to the house. The house said, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=663.02s)]
*  okay, but this still has ginormous deficits. Maybe we won't vote for it because you have the tea party [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=668.0600000000001s)]

*  They're not obviously they turned around and they said they voted on it. Okay. So now it's going to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=678.38s)]
*  go to Donald Trump's desk and he's going to sign it and he's going to make a big show of it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=687.9s)]

*  rely on Medicaid for long-term nursing home care for their grandparents not have to, I guess, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=711.42s)]
*  do additional paperwork once a month. And if they don't, they're kicked off that coverage. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=716.86s)]
*  And what happens then? What happens to people that don't have Medicaid? It's already an insane [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=722.06s)]
*  process to qualify for this stuff. There are chatters in here who qualify for it. Good luck [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=729.26s)]

*  you know, are on Medicaid, but they don't realize that they're on Medicaid because every state has [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=747.18s)]
*  a different name for it. Like that's the other side of the story. People don't even realize that [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=752.14s)]
*  they're on Medicaid. They think, Oh, I don't have Medicaid. I have like, you know, our Kansas care [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=758.54s)]
*  or whatever the is called. Right? So they, in their minds, they think, Oh, that's a totally [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=762.86s)]
*  separate thing. I'm fine. It's like, no dude, you're cooked. You're cooked. Three Democrats who died [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=766.62s)]
*  this year would have sunk Trump's big, beautiful bill. The deaths of Jerry Connolly, Sylvester [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=772.78s)]
*  Turner, raw Graval, Graval, Grigiova, Grahalva, and their impact on Trump's sprawling spending plan [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=776.7s)]
*  have reignited fears about an aging democratic party. President Donald Trump's big, beautiful [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=783.5s)]
*  bill spending squeaked through the house on Thursday morning in a 2015 and 2014 vote to [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=787.82s)]
*  Republicans Thomas Massey and Warren Davidson voted against it. GOP rep, Andy Harris of Maryland [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=792.06s)]
*  chair of the hardline house freedom caucus voted present and two other Republican reps [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=798.4599999999999s)]
*  as well. Our home is the name. Okay. Open RSS. I don't know how to do that. I'm just going to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=803.5s)]

*  all the house Democrats voted against Trump's sprawling spending plan, but they were missing [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=817.42s)]
*  three congressmen who could have sunk the bill. Bill's passage Thursday, just a day before the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=820.78s)]
*  vote, the family of representative Jerry Connolly confirmed the Virginia Democrat had died at age [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=826.14s)]
*  75 weeks after announcing his esophagal cancer had returned. Connolly had first revealed his [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=829.74s)]
*  diagnosis shortly after winning reelection last November. His passage was the third in a string [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=834.62s)]
*  of Democrat deaths in the house over the past three months following the deaths of representative [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=838.9399999999999s)]
*  Sylvester Turner, 70 representative Raul Graval, Graval, 77 in March had all three been alive and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=841.98s)]
*  voting as expected. The bill would have failed by a vote of 2017 to 2015 or not 2015, sorry, 215, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=848.54s)]
*  217 versus 215. Now, of course, in that process with the freedom caucus actually play ball, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=856.14s)]
*  most likely, of course, other factors come into play when imagining a scenario where Connolly, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=862.14s)]
*  Turner and Graval were still present for Thursday's vote in the frantic days leading up to the vote. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=866.14s)]
*  Several house Republicans threatened to oppose the bill over issues like the state and local [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=870.78s)]
*  tax deduction cap only to ultimately fall in line. It's impossible to whether it's [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=873.9s)]
*  impossible to say whether Massey, Davison and Harris would have still withheld support [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=878.22s)]
*  if they didn't believe the bill could prevail without them. Still Connolly's death is reignited [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=881.74s)]
*  concerns about the democratic party being run by a gerontography with few signs of the generational [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=886.14s)]
*  change needed. Wake of the party's crushing defeat in the 2024 election. Fitzpatrick and Massey were [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=890.86s)]
*  the only no votes. This is before, this is when the bill was first passing for the record. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=899.02s)]
*  This is when the bill first passed the house of representatives and made its way to set it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=904.54s)]
*  How many Republicans have died? Evil never dies. I mean, or I guess evil only dies if they're on [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=909.98s)]
*  the democratic side. Okay. But yeah, it's passed. It's over the new agenda. The mega bill is, is now [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=915.26s)]
*  in motion. Now there are a lot of unique things that the Republicans did that a democratic party [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=922.9399999999999s)]
*  could potentially take advantage of, but I'm holding out. I'm holding my breath. I'm not, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=928.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm not holding my breath on waiting for the Democrats to take advantage of that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=933.82s)]
*  A new calculation trick that they implemented was the idea that the pre-existing tax cuts that were [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=937.4200000000001s)]
*  supposed to, that were supposed to expire, okay. Should not be factored into the deficit and should [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=946.7800000000001s)]
*  be made permanent. That was the, that was the new math that they decided to apply, which is just [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=957.1s)]
*  bullshit. Okay. That's not how this works. Obviously there's a, there's a reason why those tax cuts are [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=962.14s)]
*  calculated in the way in, in 10 year increments. That is because they have to pass the CBO [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=970.78s)]
*  estimations and they also have to pass a budget reconciliation, a more rigid analysis of budget [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=976.78s)]
*  reconciliation has. And that's the reason why they sunset those. That's the reason why tax cuts are [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=985.18s)]
*  slated to sunset. And now they've made that permanent with a simple vote in the Senate. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=991.9s)]
*  They just pass, they just rammed it through. They were like, this technically doesn't impact the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=997.66s)]
*  deficit because it's already pre-existing tax cuts. Okay. The filibuster obviously is a silly tool that [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1002.14s)]
*  doesn't work because you have the budget reconciliation that was the, the modus operandi in the past [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1009.18s)]
*  a multiple administrations at this point, because it's the only way you can get a majority vote to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1017.98s)]
*  win shit to pass shit. And yeah, in spite of all of it, in spite of it all, they did it. They did [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1023.1800000000001s)]
*  the damn thing. Trump was able to whip the votes. Ice is going to go ham this weekend. 100%. Oh, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1031.66s)]
*  for sure. Do you think America is still robust to weather this? What? No, no, I think this is [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1037.26s)]
*  horrible. You are not aware of the Dems game. Yeah, he did it, dude. He did the dang thing. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1042.86s)]
*  My goat. This is called sex appeal. Okay. I don't want you ladies look away. You are not going to [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1047.9799999999998s)]
*  be able to pay attention to politics any longer because I'm showing you the sexiest man in Congress, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1054.3799999999999s)]
*  a big bad-ass over here. Yes. And also of course, some of the Republicans that went no turned yes [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1059.34s)]
*  because they got assurances about future promises down the line. It's bullshit. They were going to [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1066.22s)]
*  do that anyway. There was never a point where they were not voting on this. Okay. Please make [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1073.1000000000001s)]
*  no mistake. It's the same as Lisa Murkowski. Oh, Lisa Murkowski is very concerned. She's a moderate [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1078.14s)]
*  after all. She cares about Alaska. What happened? They always fall in fucking line. You know, who [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1086.14s)]
*  never falls in line? The goddamn Democrats, dude, the fucking Democrats. They never fall in line. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1093.82s)]
*  Democrats have comprehensive agenda items. They have all of these things that they promise during [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1100.62s)]
*  the campaign trail during the election cycle. And then when push comes to shove, when they actually [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1106.54s)]
*  have to act Kirsten cinema, Joe mansion, Maggie Hassan, there are a million fucking Democratic [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1112.62s)]
*  senators and Democratic Congress persons that love to play the role of a spoiler. Republicans do [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1119.66s)]
*  not have this same predicament. Maybe they have Massey and they have Rand. Okay. They have Rand [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1125.1000000000001s)]
*  Paul in the Senate and Thomas Massey in the house of representatives, but that's pretty much it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1131.18s)]
*  All of the other stuff is just a back and forth. All of the other stuff is just silly back and forth [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1137.18s)]
*  like a little bit of drama. Just remember that a Dem takes office. It takes them four years to pass [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSQVVEFo5s&t=1142.7s)]
