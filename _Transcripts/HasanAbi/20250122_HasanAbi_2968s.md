# Trump Evades Responsibility In First Interview | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k)
*  how insane it is that the former president tried to do an insurrection. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=0.0s)]
*  When Republicans talk about January 6, I unironically become the most [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=3.64s)]
*  lived up person on the planet because I'm like, dude, you did it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=7.96s)]
*  And you're like, you're not even bragging about doing it, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  even though you did it, got away with it cleanly and then released everyone [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=16.2s)]
*  that was arrested for doing some of the more heinous stuff. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=20.52s)]
*  And you're still like talking about how Nancy Pelosi did January 6, actually. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=24.6s)]
*  It's bigger than any other thing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=29.8s)]
*  It's bigger than if it were more traditional. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=31.8s)]
*  Only the second time in history. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=39.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=41.28s)]
*  Somebody didn't have consecutive terms. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=42.08s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they say it's historically bigger. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=44.28s)]
*  I don't know about that, but I can say it showed us a couple of things. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=46.32s)]
*  It showed us that the radical left, their philosophies and policies are horrible. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=51.2s)]
*  They don't work. You look at crime. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=56.56s)]
*  You look at what's gone on the border. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=58.84s)]
*  Guys, I think this guy's a right winger. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  I mean, that's going to happen. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=62.28s)]
*  But I think we got there just in the nick of time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=64.0s)]
*  But we still have you covered better than anybody. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=66.56s)]
*  We have terrorists in our country by the thousands. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=69.28s)]
*  We have murders in our country by the tens of thousands. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=72.76s)]
*  We have numbers that came out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=77.28s)]
*  Eleven thousand people are now free and walking around in our country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=79.16s)]
*  And of them, I think 48 percent, they say, killed more than one person. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  And they're walking around. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=88.48s)]
*  They came out of jails from other countries and, you know, people, they've emptied their jails. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=89.4s)]
*  I would if I were the president or prime minister or something of another country, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  I'd empty my jails right into America, into the United States. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=98.68s)]
*  Why not? And many of them did it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=102.36s)]
*  If you look at Venezuela, their rate is down now 78 percent [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  because they took their street gangs and they moved them into the United States. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  And you're seeing that in Colorado and Los Angeles and other places. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=114.12s)]
*  And we're going to take care of it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=118.48s)]
*  So did Biden really say to you when you came up to the front of the White House, welcome home? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  No, did somebody say that? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=129.32s)]
*  I read it somewhere. I don't know. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=131.4s)]
*  Maybe I really don't know. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=132.8s)]
*  So you left him a letter. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=134.4s)]
*  It was funny with Peter Doocy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=135.84s)]
*  And Peter said, Oh, Mr. President, did Joe Biden leave you a letter? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=137.32s)]
*  Did he? He did leave you a letter. He did. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=141.28s)]
*  And you left him one. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=143.2s)]
*  But you've never disclosed either one of them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=144.56s)]
*  Well, a lot of people now would be a great time. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=147.32s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=149.56s)]
*  A lot of people thought it was sort of like a set up with Peter Doocy and myself. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=150.6s)]
*  And I have a lot of respect for Peter. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=154.04s)]
*  But he just asked me a question about the letter. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=155.84s)]
*  And then I remember that, you know, like a custom, you leave it right in the drawer [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=158.48s)]
*  of that beautiful desk right alongside of us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=162.6s)]
*  And so I opened it up and I actually gave the letter to Peter. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=164.8s)]
*  And did he got to read it? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=171.84s)]
*  I guess I don't. I haven't. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=174.12s)]
*  You just said that to him a little while ago. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=175.64s)]
*  Before we get into this, so much substance. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=178.72s)]
*  You are inheriting a lot of problems, a lot of things that actually scare me. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=181.11999999999998s)]
*  And I want to get to all that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=185.88s)]
*  But I want to and I will get to all of that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  They're all solvable problems. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=190.48s)]
*  I agree. They're all solvable. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=193.6s)]
*  Not easy with time, effort, money, unfortunately, but they're all solvable. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=195.16s)]
*  We can get our country back. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=201.48s)]
*  But if we didn't win this race, I really believe our country would have been lost forever. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=203.04s)]
*  Were there moments, I mean, when you think of what they threw at you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=208.16s)]
*  And I know you signed this declaration about no more weaponization. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=212.44s)]
*  And we know that the preemptive pardons came up on Joe's way out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=217.64s)]
*  But you were facing a civil trial, a criminal trial, conviction, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=223.4s)]
*  sentencing, Jack Smith, D.C., Florida, Fannie Wallace. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=228.68s)]
*  I mean, you you fought through all of that to get back right here in this office. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=234.88s)]
*  What people don't know is over there's a little red button you push. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=242.16s)]
*  You scare people. People think it's the nuclear button, but it's really, you know, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=245.32s)]
*  something else. It's it's a user for a different purpose. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  But the question I have was at any point, did you doubt you would be back here? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=253.48s)]
*  So it's a great question. It's something I don't think about. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=261.16s)]
*  I never really thought about it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=264.16s)]
*  I don't think about you. Will I be back? I just do it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=266.36s)]
*  I get it done. I get things done. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=269.48s)]
*  I'm good at getting things done. And I set my mind to it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=271.84s)]
*  As you know, we had a great election in 2016. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=275.36s)]
*  I had a much better election in 2020. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=278.96s)]
*  And if I didn't have that election, I wouldn't have run. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=281.88s)]
*  If I thought that I didn't get the number of votes and it was reported that I got [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=285.4s)]
*  almost 75 million votes and that was their numbers, that wasn't the numbers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=289.92s)]
*  It was their numbers. That was more than anybody has gotten in history. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=293.84s)]
*  Any sitting president had ever gotten and you lost. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=298.0s)]
*  Had I got gotten like 50 million, 40 million or 60 million, I would never have run. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=302.32s)]
*  But that was like a poll. So but I had a different attitude. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  Too big to rig. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=313.88s)]
*  Poll came out just in the last 24 hours by insider advantage. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  That's Matt Towery. He nailed 2016, 2020 and 2024. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=319.6s)]
*  Great pollsters, you know, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=324.92s)]
*  And he gave you a 56 percent approval rating. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  He also said of Congress and I had a town hall with members of Congress last night [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  that that 70 percent of respondents want Congress to unite behind your agenda. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=334.8s)]
*  I watched that show. It was a great show. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=342.68s)]
*  And you had some great people in the background. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=344.44s)]
*  I know every one of them. And they're really patriots. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  I just saw the love, you know, as the speaker who is doing a terrific job, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  the speaker is answering questions and I saw the like the acknowledgement and the love they had. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=356.8s)]
*  And those are tough people behind him. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=362.88s)]
*  These are not easy people. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=364.6s)]
*  There are others that are tougher. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=365.88s)]
*  I said, well, I don't know that this is a tough group if they want to be there. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=367.36s)]
*  Not nobody much. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=371.12s)]
*  Trump not know his beat. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=372.04s)]
*  I know we can do a great job. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=373.56s)]
*  But they have a small majority. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=375.96s)]
*  You went through over 200 since we've got here and we have breaking news today that we'll get to in a minute. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=378.08s)]
*  And especially as it relates to the border and some other issues. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=384.08s)]
*  And but you're going to need to do some of these things legislatively. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=389.28s)]
*  How you you will probably play the largest role in uniting the both. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=394.44s)]
*  Why is he looking at it like that? Because they have sex chatter. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  They literally like this isn't even homophobia. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=402.24s)]
*  This is just like straight up like the truth. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=405.24s)]
*  They have the craziest sex in the Oval Office. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=407.76s)]
*  I like the concept of the one bill. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=412.08s)]
*  I guess I said one big beautiful and that's what everyone faced. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=414.76s)]
*  Actually, it's sort of a nice sound to it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  But I do like that concept. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  It could be something else. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=422.16s)]
*  It could be a smaller bill and a big bill. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  But as long as we get to the right answer now, I will say that Los Angeles has changed everything [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  because a lot of money is going to be necessary for Los Angeles. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=433.8s)]
*  And a lot of people on the other side want that to happen. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=438.44s)]
*  And North Carolina, too. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=441.04s)]
*  Well, they don't care about North Carolina. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=442.76s)]
*  The Democrats don't care about North Carolina. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=444.64s)]
*  What they've done with FEMA is so bad. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=446.72s)]
*  FEMA is a whole other discussion. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=449.12s)]
*  Do I think Trump is redeemable? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=451.12s)]
*  All it does is complicate everything. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  FEMA has not done their job for the last four years. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=454.72s)]
*  You know, I had FEMA working really well. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=458.32000000000005s)]
*  We had hurricanes in Florida. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=460.16s)]
*  We had Alabama tornadoes with. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=461.76000000000005s)]
*  But unless you have certain types of leadership, it's really it gets in the way. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=464.56s)]
*  And FEMA is going to be a whole big discussion very shortly because I'd rather see the states [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=469.92s)]
*  take care of their own problems. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=475.04s)]
*  If they have a tornado someplace and if they let that state Oklahoma is very competent. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=476.4s)]
*  I love Oklahoma. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=482.72s)]
*  Seventy seven out of seventy seven districts. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=483.92s)]
*  And that's never been done before. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=488.2s)]
*  I did it three times. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=490.04s)]
*  I mean, think of it three times. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=490.96s)]
*  Never been done. Ronald Reagan had the record fifty six, fifty six out of seventy seven. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=492.8s)]
*  I got seventy seven out of seventy seven. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=497.72s)]
*  So you have to love a place like that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=500.68s)]
*  I love Oklahoma. But you know what? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=502.08s)]
*  If they get hit with a tornado or something, let Oklahoma fix it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  You don't need and then the federal government can help them out with the money. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=507.08000000000004s)]
*  What do you know? The FEMA is getting in the way of everything. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=510.84000000000003s)]
*  And the Democrats actually use FEMA not to help North Carolina. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=514.24s)]
*  It makes no sense. So I'm stopping on Friday. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=519.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm stopping in North Carolina. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  First stop, because those people were treated very badly by Democrats. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=524.9200000000001s)]
*  And I'm stopping there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=529.6s)]
*  We're going to get that thing straightened out because they're still suffering from a hurricane from months ago. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=530.7199999999999s)]
*  And then I'm going to then I'm going to go to California. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=536.9599999999999s)]
*  I'll go to meet with Gavin. I don't know. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=540.12s)]
*  I haven't even thought about it. Look, Gavin's got one thing he can do. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=542.56s)]
*  He can release the water. There is massive amounts of water, rainwater and mountain water that comes through with the snow comes down as it melts. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  There's so much water they're releasing it into the Pacific Ocean. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  And I told him for it's a political thing for the Democrats. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=560.44s)]
*  I don't know the tape. You said it to him in front of him in 2018. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=563.8800000000001s)]
*  I said it to him in front of the media and everything else. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=567.36s)]
*  And nobody talks about it. The media never picks it up. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=569.8000000000001s)]
*  You pick you put it out. I was so happy to see that tape because some people said, is that possible? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=572.32s)]
*  They have they have water coming down from the Pacific Northwest. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=578.96s)]
*  I'm talking about a water so much water that they'd have to let some of it go at some point. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=583.5200000000001s)]
*  They don't need reservoirs. They don't need any. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=588.8s)]
*  They're spending all this money on these reservoirs. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=591.08s)]
*  If and they're fake reservoirs, you know, they're but the reservoirs were empty. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=593.2s)]
*  The hydrants didn't work and they're not practicing the science of forestry, which is sprinklers didn't work in the homes because they had no water. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=597.56s)]
*  Think of it. We have sprinklers. Think of it with no water. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=604.28s)]
*  They didn't have any water. The fire hydrants. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  You have to live in hard to believe the place has sprinklers. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=609.48s)]
*  It's nice. But you don't want to lose this office. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=611.84s)]
*  By the way, how do you like it? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  It's well, I'm glad it's great to be back. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=618.76s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. You know, I've had the biggest people in the world come here and they come into the Oval Office. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=621.0s)]
*  And they just look and and they want time to look. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=629.04s)]
*  They're looking around. So Washington, Able, Honest Abe. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=632.92s)]
*  One day maybe we could do a tour. We had a conversation and maybe I shouldn't disclose this, but I will. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=637.4s)]
*  And it was after the 2020 election. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=644.4s)]
*  And you asked me a question and we've known each other for 30 years. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  So we have a friendship and we have a professional relationship. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  And the question you asked me, maybe in the end, it will be better that if I came back in four years and we talked about history after World War two, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=654.72s)]
*  Winston Churchill was thrown out, but they brought him back over Cleveland. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=667.56s)]
*  He's the only other American president that did not serve consecutive terms. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=672.32s)]
*  And my answer to you was I thought it would be bigger if you came back. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=676.88s)]
*  It's turning out to be bigger. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=682.0400000000001s)]
*  And I think one thing is happening is people are learning that they can't govern and that their policies are terrible. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=684.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, they don't want to see. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=691.5200000000001s)]
*  A woman get pummeled by a man in a boxing ring. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=695.24s)]
*  They don't want to see men in women's sports and otherwise. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=699.76s)]
*  They don't want to see men. They don't want to have transgender for everyone. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=702.28s)]
*  They don't want a child leave home as a boy and come back two days later as a girl. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=705.84s)]
*  A parent doesn't want to see that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=712.48s)]
*  And there are states where that can happen. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=714.52s)]
*  They don't want to see taxes go through the roof. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=716.68s)]
*  Like this is the only group of people they want to raise your taxes. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=720.12s)]
*  They say we want to raise your taxes. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=722.88s)]
*  You know, if they don't work with us on the Trump tax cuts extending, that would mean we go back to the taxes. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=726.8399999999999s)]
*  We've got the largest tax cut in history. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=734.0s)]
*  That would mean the taxes would go up more than any tax hike in the history of our country. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=736.1999999999999s)]
*  And normally you'd say that's got to be the easiest negotiation in history, because if they did that, how could they ever win an election? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=742.12s)]
*  But they'll fight us on that. They fight us on things. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=751.12s)]
*  It's incredible. You don't use common sense. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=753.3199999999999s)]
*  In my opinion, the Democrats don't use common sense. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=756.4s)]
*  And that's why... [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=759.32s)]
*  Common sense won the day in the election. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=759.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but you know the amazing thing? I'm watching now. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=761.8000000000001s)]
*  Now it's time and, you know, a few months have passed and the election's over and you see what happened. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=763.88s)]
*  And it was a rout. I want all seven swing states that we won by millions of votes. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=768.92s)]
*  The popular vote millions. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=772.36s)]
*  And nobody can even believe some of the numbers. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=773.96s)]
*  And how about with African Americans, with Hispanics, with with everything, how well we did. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=777.44s)]
*  Nobody can believe the numbers. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=782.88s)]
*  How about with youth? I won youth by 36 points. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=786.28s)]
*  Now, maybe that's because I went on TikTok. I don't know. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=790.1999999999999s)]
*  But I'm starting to have a very warm... [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=792.48s)]
*  TikTok is going to be sold, right? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=794.1999999999999s)]
*  I think TikTok's going to be sold. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=796.16s)]
*  People want to buy it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=797.92s)]
*  But those that say they know, say a spying app for the communist Chinese. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=800.9599999999999s)]
*  But you can say that about everything made in China. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=807.64s)]
*  Look, we have our telephones made in China, for the most part. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=810.4399999999999s)]
*  We have so many things made in China. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=813.4s)]
*  So why don't they mention that? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=815.52s)]
*  You know, the interesting thing with TikTok, though, is you're dealing with a lot of young people. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=817.36s)]
*  So they love it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=821.4s)]
*  Is it that important for China to be spying on young people and young kids watching crazy videos? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=822.4s)]
*  I don't want China spying on anybody. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=827.92s)]
*  No, no. But but but they make you have telephones and they make your computers and they make a lot of other things. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=829.44s)]
*  Isn't that a bigger threat? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=834.96s)]
*  I'm sure that'll be part of your discussions with President Xi, which I'm going to talk about in a moment. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=836.2s)]
*  Let me go to the border. We do have breaking news today. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  I ran into Tom Holman as I was walking in today and so far, three hundred and eight total arrests, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=842.56s)]
*  296 detained detainees and the first deployment of military assets to the U.S. border. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=849.8s)]
*  The deployment includes active duty troops and the National Guard. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=858.16s)]
*  And here's my biggest fear and concern beyond the Iranian assassination squads is we now know 14 million. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=862.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't know how many gotaways. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=872.28s)]
*  We don't know the total number, but we have known terrorists in our country. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=873.76s)]
*  We have known murderers, rapists. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  We have violent criminals, cartel members, gang members. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  Now, I would imagine if you came to me that they just like genuinely say that the Democratic government [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=887.04s)]
*  deliberately and knowingly and the law enforcement agencies deliberately and knowingly brought these people into the country. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=893.52s)]
*  An attack on our homeland like it's such a [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=900.36s)]
*  mistake, but it's actually extra crazy that we don't even like think that's a weird thing that they're saying, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=904.2s)]
*  because notice how they just say it so much that it's now become the truth. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=911.12s)]
*  That's what I'm so frustrated by. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=916.0s)]
*  We're like, it's just completely insane under normal circumstances. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=918.08s)]
*  When someone says something like that, you're supposed to go, what are you? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=923.64s)]
*  What? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=926.12s)]
*  You need to get lithium pronto, dog. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=927.48s)]
*  What the fuck are you saying? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=930.48s)]
*  For years, and you actually make one statement before you say that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=931.96s)]
*  You say 100 percent certain. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=935.32s)]
*  I do. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=938.12s)]
*  That's a pretty big statement. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=938.6s)]
*  And then I say, I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=939.6s)]
*  Yeah, I hope you're wrong, too. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=941.28s)]
*  And I won't comment, but I tend to agree with you. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=942.48s)]
*  It depends. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=946.88s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=947.44s)]
*  Look, we have a lot of great people right now, a lot of great, great people on this situation. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=948.24s)]
*  This was a gross miscarriage of common sense to allow people to come in. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=954.36s)]
*  And I believe the number is 21 million people, and a large percentage of them are criminals. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=960.44s)]
*  All over the world. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=966.96s)]
*  This is not just South America. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=967.64s)]
*  This isn't, you know, we talk Venezuela. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=969.04s)]
*  That's a big abuser. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=970.6800000000001s)]
*  But these are countries from Iran, Syria, the countries that you don't even think of. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=971.72s)]
*  The Congo has emptied their prisons out into the United States. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=978.2s)]
*  We're not thinking about the Congo. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=982.2s)]
*  We're thinking about South America. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=983.6s)]
*  It's much more than South America. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=984.9200000000001s)]
*  But prisons from all over the world have been emptied out into our country by Biden, allowing [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=987.0400000000001s)]
*  it to happen. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=992.64s)]
*  I don't even know if he knew what the hell was going on. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=993.6s)]
*  But but who would want this? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=995.72s)]
*  I always say to people, you know, you always like to understand, like in a business, you [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=998.48s)]
*  want to understand the other side. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1001.76s)]
*  Why do they want something, you know, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1003.0s)]
*  And you figure it out. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1004.96s)]
*  And there's usually an answer almost always. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1006.28s)]
*  I don't understand why does somebody want open borders where they say the vote. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1008.6s)]
*  But I did well with the Hispanic vote. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1013.4399999999999s)]
*  If you're looking at Hispanic, they say they do it because they want to think they're going [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1015.24s)]
*  to stay in power. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  It's going to be better for Democrats. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1021.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't really believe that. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1023.1999999999999s)]
*  Besides that, they cheat so much. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1024.32s)]
*  They don't have to do that. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1025.52s)]
*  They cheat so well. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1026.52s)]
*  They're very good at cheating. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1027.52s)]
*  The only thing they're good at really is cheating. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1028.52s)]
*  But here's the thing I ask. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1030.04s)]
*  Why would somebody say that open borders are good where jails and mental institutions from [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1031.92s)]
*  other countries and gang members right off the streets of the toughest cities in the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1036.8s)]
*  world are being brought to the United States of America and emptied out into our country? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1040.76s)]
*  Why would anybody that even likes, you don't have to love our country. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1047.48s)]
*  You have to like it. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1050.68s)]
*  Why would anybody that likes our country, the Democrats allow that to happen? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1052.52s)]
*  And even now I watch them on television. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1057.66s)]
*  They're trying to justify it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1060.28s)]
*  I love again, false premise that is now completely just seen as the truth that migras are coming [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1061.68s)]
*  in with hatred for this country. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1068.4s)]
*  Where the fuck would they come here, dude? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1070.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh, it's not stupid. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1071.68s)]
*  You're either stupid or you hate the country. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1073.96s)]
*  Migrants that are coming in that hate this country and the Democrats are letting them [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1076.64s)]
*  have letting them in and they must also hate the country because they're letting in the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1079.76s)]
*  people that hate this country into the country on purpose. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  And it's like it's just so insane. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  It's such an insane thing like the notion that like all these people that are coming [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1089.64s)]
*  into America actually despise America as someone who came to America. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1093.04s)]
*  Let me tell you, OK, I learned. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1096.64s)]
*  I learned the cold, hard truth about America after I came here. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1099.44s)]
*  I came here because I wanted to come here and I was very fortunate. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1103.52s)]
*  OK, I come from a relatively affluent background and it was still a difficult thing to just [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1107.04s)]
*  like leave your family and your friends behind or whatever. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1113.28s)]
*  But like these people are leaving so much else behind and they're not coming in here [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1115.68s)]
*  with like a warm reception. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1120.8s)]
*  Like I came here for college. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1123.72s)]
*  I promise you those people don't hate America. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1125.52s)]
*  OK. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1127.72s)]
*  And neither did I. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1129.56s)]
*  When I first came here, I wanted to live here really bad. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1130.84s)]
*  And I still want to live here as a matter of fact. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1135.28s)]
*  But the reality of the matter is I definitely learned all of the problems that American [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1137.44s)]
*  modern American society had fairly quickly as a matter of fact. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1144.24s)]
*  And also, that is precisely the reason why undocumented migrants for that and also because [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1149.2s)]
*  they want to avoid any sort of legal scrutiny whatsoever are not responsible for share the [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1155.28s)]
*  crimes per capita than natural born US citizens. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1160.68s)]
*  You understand? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1163.8s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1164.72s)]
*  New immigrants like America more than I do. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1165.56s)]
*  And I was born here. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1167.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1168.48s)]
*  You always say conservatives have their Lord down pat. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1168.92s)]
*  The Lord is repeated so much. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1171.0800000000002s)]
*  They're believers to admit that they're not going to be able to do anything. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1172.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1176.52s)]
*  It's just crazy that like it just sucks that you could just like repeat something that's [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1176.8s)]
*  a falsehood over and over again. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1180.96s)]
*  And as long as there's no like active counter messaging against it, people will just believe [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1183.44s)]
*  it and it becomes the truth, even if it's just completely untrue. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1188.08s)]
*  And no matter how much evidence is presented against it by the likes of someone like myself [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1192.8799999999999s)]
*  or maybe some other places like the United States, the United States, the United States, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1198.92s)]
*  maybe some other places like it just doesn't matter. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1204.56s)]
*  People are like, nah, I'm invested in the narrative and the narrative has become the truth for [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1207.52s)]
*  me. It truly sucks. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1211.04s)]
*  It's just I don't know. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1212.92s)]
*  Wasn't that Hitler strategy? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1214.44s)]
*  I mean, a lot of politicians do this and not just Adolf Hitler. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1215.32s)]
*  Adolf Hitler did not invent the concept of lying as a political figure. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1218.52s)]
*  But yes, specifically as it pertains to lying about certain minority groups being responsible [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1223.56s)]
*  for crimes and all of the evils of society. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1228.84s)]
*  Yes, that is very Hitlerian. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1231.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1233.44s)]
*  Germany says Hitler was a communist. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1234.04s)]
*  Yeah. No, they don't. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1236.2s)]
*  That's the AFD that says that. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1237.2s)]
*  And even they don't say communist. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1239.0s)]
*  They say socialist. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1240.08s)]
*  Wasn't there something we were going to watch it live at six or was that for another day? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1241.28s)]
*  We're watching it right now. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1244.76s)]
*  It's just the ad break, which, by the way, reminds me that you can subscribe for six [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1245.96s)]

*  We're trying to end them and a lot of the people in those communities don't want them. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1373.84s)]
*  You know, California is a big example. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1377.12s)]
*  Cut off their money. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1379.04s)]
*  I might have to do that. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1380.3999999999999s)]
*  Sometimes that's the only thing you can do. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1381.76s)]
*  Look, California is a great example of it. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1383.48s)]
*  If you actually polled the people, they don't want sanctuary cities. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1386.56s)]
*  But Gavin Newsom does and these radical left politicians do. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1390.24s)]
*  And, you know, if you asked them why they couldn't even. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1395.12s)]
*  I watched Gavin Newsom try to answer that question. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1397.36s)]
*  He was unable to even answer. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1400.24s)]

*  He was unable to answer. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1402.92s)]
*  I ask him one other question. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1404.36s)]
*  Why is it that you don't want millions of gallons of water a day [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1406.52s)]
*  pouring throughout California? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1410.84s)]
*  You know, the farmland in California is, they say, the equivalent of Iowa, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1412.52s)]
*  great land, but it's got no water. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1417.04s)]
*  And you sit there and it's it's literally you can see it burning. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1419.72s)]
*  It's on flame. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1423.04s)]
*  All they need is water in that big farmland. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1424.36s)]
*  And I ask him why? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1426.72s)]
*  How is it possible that you're not allowing this water? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1428.24s)]
*  They diverted out to the Pacific Ocean where it drops into the ocean. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1431.44s)]
*  And you know what it's like? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1435.72s)]
*  It's like nothing to the Pacific Ocean. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1436.96s)]
*  It's like it's like two glasses of water. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1439.6s)]
*  It's nothing. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1442.68s)]
*  Millions of gallons of water is diverted [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1443.96s)]
*  way up north in California into the Pacific Ocean. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1448.08s)]
*  They have the pipes and it's half pipes. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1452.44s)]
*  You see them all the time. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1455.08s)]
*  Half pipes. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1456.48s)]
*  People live in those half pipes now. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1457.92s)]
*  You know, they have homeless living in those half type. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1459.96s)]
*  But this is water that millions of gallons of water a week and a day, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1462.44s)]
*  in some cases, you know, depending on the flow, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1469.9199999999998s)]
*  so much water, they wouldn't know what to do with it. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1472.56s)]
*  Your sprinklers would be filled. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1474.84s)]
*  They can even remember when I took criticism [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1476.96s)]
*  because they said you have to manage your manage your forest. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1479.3999999999999s)]
*  The head of a country that lives in forests, a number of them, actually. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1482.72s)]
*  Finland told me this. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1487.4s)]
*  Austria told me this. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1489.44s)]
*  The head of Austria, head of Finland. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1491.48s)]
*  And it was beautiful the way they expressed it. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1493.64s)]
*  They said, we live in a forest. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1495.48s)]
*  We are a forest nation. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1498.24s)]
*  That's beautiful, isn't it? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1500.16s)]
*  To say that we have trees that are. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1501.4s)]
*  The most magnificent in the world, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1504.76s)]
*  far more beautiful than what they have in California and much more flammable. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1507.1200000000001s)]
*  He said, we don't have forest fires. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1511.88s)]
*  We manage our forests. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1514.04s)]
*  You get a degree in forestry. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1515.56s)]
*  They'll do cuts. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1517.04s)]
*  Yeah. Can you imagine? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1518.2s)]
*  But you don't need much. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1519.2s)]
*  You have to clean the floors of the forest. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1521.48s)]
*  You know, when when they had forests, I go to see some of the sites. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1524.6s)]
*  I watched it. California. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1528.52s)]
*  They use billions of dollars of money and they do set. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1530.04s)]
*  And look at what happened. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1533.3999999999999s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1534.96s)]
*  That's like a nuclear weapon. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1536.8799999999999s)]
*  What's happened to Los Angeles. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1538.68s)]
*  And, you know, that thing went for four or five days. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1540.8799999999999s)]
*  Nobody was even fighting it because they didn't have any water. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1543.1599999999999s)]
*  Their fire departments aren't funded properly. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1546.84s)]
*  And the firefighters were brave as hell. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1550.12s)]
*  They were fighting without water. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1552.36s)]
*  I mean, they turn on a fire hydrant. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1554.1599999999999s)]
*  There's no water that comes out. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1556.04s)]
*  And they're sitting and the fires are rushing at them at 30, 40 miles an hour. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1557.6s)]
*  Those firefighters were brave. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1562.1599999999999s)]
*  What happened to that state is incredible. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1564.56s)]

*  There was nothing. It took a week and a half. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1671.56s)]
*  And and I've never seen anything like it. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1674.1200000000001s)]
*  We look so weak. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1677.04s)]
*  Will you give obviously Americans want to help other Americans in need? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1678.44s)]
*  OK, fair enough. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1683.56s)]
*  We do that. We got to help the people of North Carolina. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1684.8s)]
*  They've been suffering. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1687.16s)]
*  Well, you know, that's what I want to do. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1687.96s)]
*  That's why I'm stopping there first. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1689.4s)]
*  You're going to stop in California. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1690.72s)]
*  I'm stopping in North Carolina. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1692.08s)]
*  Should the money be contingent on on them practicing the science of forestry? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1693.68s)]
*  Well, I think this I'm going to put a statement out today, I think. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1698.68s)]
*  And maybe it's already written. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1703.16s)]
*  I said, I don't think we should give California anything until they let water [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1704.48s)]
*  flow down into their system, the north to the south. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1708.68s)]
*  This is a political thing. I don't know what it is. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1711.04s)]
*  You know, they talk about the Delta smelt. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1713.0s)]
*  It's a little tiny fish like this. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1714.8s)]
*  I want to say it's an endangered species. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1716.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, how is it endangered? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1718.68s)]
*  No wonder it's endangered. It's not getting any water. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1720.16s)]
*  How do you if you have a fish and you're [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1722.6s)]
*  stopping the water is not going to hurt the fish. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1725.16s)]
*  I did a show in 2009 from the San Joaquin Valley, Devin Nunes' district. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1727.68s)]
*  Right. And they wouldn't give thousands of acres of farmland water to protect that. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1732.72s)]
*  By the way, you see that now. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1738.28s)]
*  I drove up the highway with Devin Nunes and other Republican congressmen. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1739.96s)]
*  And I looked at these vast areas of land and it looked like it was just burning. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1745.08s)]
*  It was dark. It was dry. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1749.4s)]
*  And then there'd be a little patch, a little tiny patch of green, beautiful green. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1752.0800000000002s)]
*  And I said, why? How come all this land has these little patches? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1757.3200000000002s)]
*  They said that's all that we're allowed to farm because we have no water. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1760.8000000000002s)]
*  I said, are you having a drought? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1764.48s)]
*  No, they've turned off the water. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1766.24s)]
*  They turned off the spigot from up north in order to protect the Delta smelt. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1768.2800000000002s)]
*  And we will go into the economy. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1773.68s)]
*  I don't really believe it's the Delta smelt because nobody could do that. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1775.04s)]
*  Just well, it's not endangered either. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1780.16s)]
*  They have it in other locations, etc. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1782.28s)]
*  They're doing seemingly everything they [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1784.6s)]
*  could do, like New York is in many ways to chase people away. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1786.52s)]
*  No, but could you imagine today? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1790.72s)]
*  It's crazy when people and the press doesn't like when I talk about the water [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1792.24s)]
*  that they're turning into the Pacific, the press never wants to put it on. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1796.16s)]
*  The fake news, they don't want to put it on show. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1800.92s)]
*  You do realize that you have permanently [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1803.52s)]
*  tattooed into the forehead of legacy media the term fake news. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1806.32s)]
*  You do realize they spent nine years, nine years attacking you from the moment [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1812.72s)]
*  you came down that escalator and they didn't stop. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1820.32s)]
*  And here's the interesting part to me is that all of the attacks, all the [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1823.8799999999999s)]
*  weaponization, all the FISA warrants, all the Russia, Russia and we can go on. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1828.9599999999998s)]
*  All the various venues, the J-6 committee, which kept out a lot of pertinent. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1835.4399999999998s)]
*  And how about the J-6 committee? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1841.08s)]
*  I say I got the unselect, you know, they say to say they didn't win. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1843.04s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1846.32s)]
*  What they did was criminal. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1847.84s)]
*  That's why they got pardoned. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1849.0s)]
*  No, they deleted and destroyed all of the information that they collect. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1850.24s)]
*  I know they need a pardon. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1854.6s)]
*  And he tries to keep the conversation on the rails so hard. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1855.6s)]
*  And Trump is just like not he's not even remotely having all of the information [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1859.28s)]
*  having to do with the ten thousand soldiers that I offered to Nancy Pelosi. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1864.08s)]
*  And she's now like, Mr. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1867.6s)]
*  President, please, sir, let's get back on track. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1869.28s)]
*  Please. I beg of you. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1871.8s)]
*  He's like, no, you saying that you authorized it in the days leading up. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1873.12s)]
*  The Capitol Police chief asked for [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1876.92s)]
*  the guard was begging for the guard, Muriel Bowser. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1880.12s)]
*  Are we still talking about January 6? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1883.28s)]
*  Like liberals talking about January 6 is annoying, but at least they're on the [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1885.72s)]
*  right side of being like, look at how insane it is that the former president [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1889.48s)]
*  tried to do an insurrection when Republicans talk about January 6. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1893.2s)]
*  I unironically become the most lived up person on the planet because I'm like, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1897.16s)]
*  dude, you did it and you're like, you're not even bragging about doing it, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1901.24s)]
*  even though you did it, got away with it cleanly and then released everyone that, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1907.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, was arrested for doing some of the more heinous stuff. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1912.0s)]
*  And you're still like talking about how Nancy Pelosi did January 6, actually. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1915.72s)]
*  Than any person in the history of Congress, she was by a number that nobody has ever [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1921.16s)]
*  like the Republican January 6 position is so insane. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1928.0800000000002s)]
*  It's done by Antifa. It's done by Nancy Pelosi. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1930.68s)]
*  It's done by my most loyal servants and therefore they must be released. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1933.24s)]
*  It wasn't actually an insurrection, but if it was, it was done by Antifa and the FBI. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1937.8000000000002s)]
*  Even though the FBI was under my control at the time because I was a fucking [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1942.04s)]
*  president and also Nancy Pelosi personally called off the National Guard knowing [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1945.68s)]
*  full well how Antifa would operate. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1950.72s)]
*  But it's also my fans because I released them from prison. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1952.3600000000001s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1955.16s)]
*  The Wuhan virology lab, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1956.68s)]
*  there seems to be text and messages and emails that went back and forth. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1958.8400000000001s)]
*  The you talk about the unselect committee, as you call it, the January 6 committee. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1962.88s)]
*  They had a predetermined outcome. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1968.24s)]
*  General Milley, all these people, the Biden family members. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1971.0s)]
*  Joe Biden ran and said he would never do preemptive pardons. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1975.12s)]
*  It was an issue that came up when you were leaving your first time. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1978.84s)]
*  He thought he heard that I was going to do I didn't want to do it. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1981.3999999999999s)]
*  I was given the option. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1984.84s)]
*  They said, sir, would you like to pardon everybody, including yourself? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1986.52s)]
*  I said, I'm not going to pardon anybody. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1990.48s)]
*  We didn't do anything wrong. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1992.6s)]
*  And we had people that suffered their incredible patriots. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1994.28s)]
*  We had people that suffered. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=1997.32s)]
*  You had Bannon put in jail. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2000.24s)]
*  You had Peter Navarro put in jail. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2002.28s)]
*  You had people that suffered. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2004.3999999999999s)]
*  And and far worse than that, they've lost their fortunes. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2007.52s)]
*  They've lost their whatever their nest egg, paying it to lawyers. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2012.12s)]
*  And those people and people said, and they don't even they wouldn't have even taken [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2016.04s)]
*  most of those people, they wouldn't have even taken a part. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2021.8s)]
*  This guy went around giving everybody pardons. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2024.96s)]
*  And, you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing is he didn't give himself a [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2027.1200000000001s)]
*  pardon. And if you look at it, it all had to do with him. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2033.92s)]
*  I mean, the money went to him. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2039.16s)]
*  Should Congress investigate that? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2041.28s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2042.88s)]
*  It's you know, I ordered the deal. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2043.88s)]
*  I've always been. Look. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2045.8400000000001s)]
*  He didn't give himself a pardon and he didn't give some other people a pardon [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2048.08s)]
*  that needed it. And I heard Schiff went to him and just begged him for a pardon [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2052.32s)]
*  because Schiff is a crook. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2056.84s)]
*  Schiff is a crooked guy. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2058.6400000000003s)]
*  He's a crooked politician. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2060.48s)]
*  He made up the story about Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2062.5600000000004s)]
*  Totally made it up. He's a storyteller. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2065.0800000000004s)]
*  And then after he made it up, they found out that there was a tape of the [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2067.5600000000004s)]
*  conversation made by, you know, I guess the State Department. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2073.0s)]
*  I don't know. When you make calls, they make tapes sometimes, not all the time. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2078.4s)]
*  He was the one talking to the Russians. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2081.6400000000003s)]
*  So he in the meantime made up the conversation, totally made it up. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2083.4s)]
*  There was no quid pro quo. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2086.96s)]
*  Just the idea was a perfect. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2088.76s)]

*  but there was a lot of patriotism with those people, a lot of patriotism. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2538.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, they did a recording and, you know, they asked me if I do the voiceover [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2542.96s)]
*  and I did, you know, it was the number one selling whatever you call it nowadays, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2548.2s)]
*  album, whatever, song, CD, whatever you call it. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2552.64s)]
*  You don't know. It changes every year. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2555.48s)]
*  Right. But but it was the number one selling song, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2557.08s)]
*  number one on Billboard, number one on everything, on everything for so long. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2561.24s)]
*  People get it. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2566.68s)]
*  They wanted to see those people. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2568.16s)]
*  The people were where you told them what you would do. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2570.16s)]
*  Joe, I was talking about the January 6 choir chat. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2573.6s)]
*  Yes, it's that stupid. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2577.2s)]
*  Yes, this is the president of the United States of America. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2579.0s)]
*  Yes, the Democratic Party lost to this man not once, but twice. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2583.0s)]
*  Voted for me and I wanted a landslide. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2588.0s)]
*  And that was only one of the many. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2590.48s)]
*  He said he would not do preemptive pardons back in 2020. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2591.96s)]
*  Chuck Schumer said it. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2595.52s)]
*  Schiff said it. They all said it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2596.52s)]
*  The media said it. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2597.88s)]
*  The precedent that he said on pardons is amazing. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2599.08s)]
*  That's a much bigger story. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2601.84s)]
*  But people don't like talking about it. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2603.04s)]
*  He he pardoned everybody, but he didn't pardon himself. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2605.0s)]
*  And remember this, those people that he pardoned are now mandated because they got [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2609.0s)]
*  a pardon to testify and they can't take the Fed. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2613.28s)]
*  Should Congress investigate that? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2616.08s)]
*  I think we'll let Congress decide. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2618.84s)]
*  Would you want the attorney general to investigate it? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2621.48s)]
*  You know, I was always against that with presidents and Hillary Clinton. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2623.52s)]
*  I could have had Hillary Clinton, a big number done on her. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2627.8s)]
*  Have you changed your mind? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2631.2s)]
*  I didn't want to. Well. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2632.16s)]
*  I went through four years of hell. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2634.56s)]
*  By the scum that we had to deal with, I went through four years of hell. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2638.24s)]
*  I spent millions of dollars in legal fees and I won, but I did it the hard way. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2643.7599999999998s)]
*  Uh, it's really hard to say that they shouldn't have to go through it all. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2652.04s)]
*  So it is very hard to say that Joe Biden. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2656.64s)]
*  Remember this? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2659.6s)]
*  Joe Biden got very bad advice because like he has in everything. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2660.92s)]
*  Hunter's laptop. He got bad advice on Ukraine. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2666.12s)]
*  He got bad advice that war should have never started. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2668.48s)]
*  He got bad advice on Israel. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2671.2799999999997s)]
*  He got bad advice on the way he got out of Afghanistan. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2673.44s)]
*  We should have gotten out with strength and dignity, not not like a bunch of losers. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2676.4s)]
*  Joe Biden has very bad advisors. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2681.4799999999996s)]
*  Somebody somebody advised Joe Biden. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2684.7999999999997s)]
*  To give pardons to everybody but him, they wanted to take care of John. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2689.16s)]
*  They wanted to. I don't care. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2694.0s)]
*  This is more important because right now the economy is going to do great. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2696.24s)]
*  I'm here so they can't. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2699.4399999999996s)]
*  But you have to understand he had bad advisors on almost everything. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2701.08s)]
*  It's like in the old days when the secretary of state said he never made a [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2706.2s)]
*  correct decision on foreign policy, Joe Biden got very bad advice. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2709.68s)]
*  You've been through the two would be assassins. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2714.44s)]
*  You came within a millimeter of losing your life in this whole process. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2718.12s)]
*  I know you kind of are somebody that compartmentalizes because I've known you [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2723.6s)]
*  so long, but do you ever think and you said this [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2727.48s)]
*  in your inaugural that you really believe God saved your life so that this was your [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2731.16s)]
*  destiny? Explain that. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2737.0s)]
*  Well, I do believe that I've had [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2738.6s)]
*  people that really know. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2741.84s)]
*  A lot about guns and they said that gun, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2748.48s)]
*  that particular gun, that beautiful field, as I called it in Pennsylvania, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2751.24s)]
*  which it is Butler, that that gun is a very accurate gun and that a bad shooter [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2755.2s)]
*  would hit the target 100 percent of the time you can't miss from that distance. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2762.04s)]
*  Yeah, from that distance. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2767.12s)]
*  I mean, to me, I didn't know. I don't know as much about it. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2768.32s)]
*  They said it's like for a golfer sinking a one foot putt from that distance. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2771.92s)]
*  And my son, Don, and my son, both of them, Eric, they're great shooters. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2776.32s)]
*  Both of them are great shooters. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2781.24s)]
*  And they said it's it's amazing. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2783.0s)]
*  It's a miracle. I think it affected them because they can't believe that that [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2785.4s)]
*  happened. I turned if I didn't turn it, you know, the turn was. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2788.28s)]
*  I like split second perfect timing. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2792.64s)]
*  So something happened and. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2795.24s)]
*  I don't think you can call it just luck. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2799.04s)]
*  It was the chance was like one eighth of a second. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2801.64s)]
*  Or we wouldn't be sitting here. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2806.4s)]
*  And think of it in a volume of time, one eighth of a second, I was in the right [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2808.4s)]
*  position. Do you believe that moment? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2812.92s)]
*  People say to me they see a change in you. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2816.12s)]
*  Do you believe you've changed? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2819.44s)]
*  Is this, for example, increased your faith in God? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2821.36s)]
*  Yes, I think so. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2824.08s)]
*  I don't think I've changed, but I think that has taken place. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2825.36s)]
*  Yeah, because when you look at statistically, it's I should never be here. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2828.24s)]
*  I mean, that if I don't tell me I'm looking at an immigration chart, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2834.92s)]
*  my favorite chart ever in history, even if it was a bit, even if the numbers were [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2839.6s)]
*  bad, I would mean we're talking about assassination and you know, can you believe [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2843.7599999999998s)]
*  it? No, no, no, no, but it's terrible. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2846.88s)]
*  No, I remember that day like when I when I turned and it had to be at exactly 90 [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2848.64s)]
*  degree angle and I said, throw down the chart or something to that effect. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2852.68s)]
*  And they bring the chart. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2857.44s)]
*  And I'm literally looking exactly at the right angle. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2858.64s)]
*  I couldn't have even been a little further or a little bit less. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2861.48s)]
*  It would have whacked because it was an eighth of an inch. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2864.7599999999998s)]
*  The entire ride was an eighth of an inch. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2867.72s)]
*  Will you investigate these assassination attempts? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2870.04s)]
*  And you stated that you will release the files, all of the files as it relates to [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2873.0s)]
*  the JFK assassination. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2878.96s)]
*  By the way, this this is his desk. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2880.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2882.84s)]
*  Is it this is where John can a little. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2883.84s)]
*  He's been he's been lying about this shit. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2886.52s)]
*  He's been lying about this shit like 2016, 2017. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2889.32s)]
*  Her you this was going to happen in the first. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2893.92s)]
*  People have asked me to do that. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2896.64s)]
*  And. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2899.0s)]
*  I did I did it with Kennedy to an extent, but I was asked by some of our government [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2900.68s)]
*  officials not to. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2906.72s)]
*  And, you know, you have to respect them. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2908.48s)]
*  I was actually asked by Mike Pompeo, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2910.48s)]
*  the secretary of state, not to. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2912.6s)]
*  And he I felt he knew something that maybe, you know, when he asked you not to, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2916.08s)]
*  you sort of say why. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2921.3599999999997s)]
*  And he felt that it was just not a good time to release him. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2923.68s)]
*  And you might ask him why. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2928.44s)]
*  Maybe maybe he'll deny that even. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2931.3599999999997s)]
*  But he did. He asked me. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2933.7599999999998s)]
*  And some others also, though, they didn't want the Kennedy stuff released. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2935.24s)]
*  And they're professionals and I respect them. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2940.56s)]
*  And they're working for me and the country. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2943.56s)]
*  They're working for the country. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2945.96s)]
*  And so I didn't release, but I'm going to release them immediately [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2947.7999999999997s)]
*  upon getting we're going to see the information. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2952.96s)]
*  We're looking at it right now. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2955.08s)]
*  More Hannity from the White House as we continue. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nqtg7cSW7k&t=2957.36s)]
