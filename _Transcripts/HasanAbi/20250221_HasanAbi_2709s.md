# Trump Defends Israel In An Interview With Brian Kilmeade | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY)
*  But the delicate balance for all Arab nations is the consistent threat of their population rising [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=0.0s)]
*  up and rebelling against them. And there is nothing that will cause their populations to revolt [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=10.48s)]
*  more than actively throwing away the Gaza cause. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=17.84s)]
*  Speaking of people who lie or say unhinged shit, Donald Trump went on Brian Kilmeade's radio show [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=22.16s)]
*  and he said he's had it with Zelensky. Well, I have the best poll numbers I've ever had. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=38.24s)]
*  So that feels good. It's always nice. We won. Damn. He sounds sick. All seven swing states [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=45.2s)]
*  in addition, and we got the popular vote by millions of votes. But now I have much higher [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=52.0s)]
*  poll numbers and even the elections. So I've never had such wonderful numbers. People have always said, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  well, I don't know, is he doing good or don't we know or whatever? But I guess people did feel we [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  did a great job in term one and that's how we won. But right now I just got them the best poll [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  numbers I've ever had beating everybody. So that's nice. That's always nice, Brian. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=76.88s)]
*  I know you always like to keep score. Mr. Oh, I know you love keeping score. Mr. President. I [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=81.52s)]
*  love you president. The one thing that you inherited and that is Hamas since October 7th, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=87.36s)]
*  they've been aware and the IDF has been with Hamas yesterday. We got four hostages back in caskets, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  two of which were children, nine months and four years old. And the mom that they gave back was not [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  even the right body. As we wait for six more hostages to be returned on Saturday, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=104.72s)]
*  what do you think should happen with Benjamin Netanyahu, the IDF and Hamas? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=109.92s)]
*  Well, I speak to him and he's certainly, he's actually not torn. I mean, you know where he [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=115.44s)]
*  stands and he would like to go and he just is so angry and he should be. If he's not angry, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  then there'd be something wrong with him. Frankly, he is very angry. He's a very angry man at what [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=127.12s)]
*  happened, especially what happened yesterday with these kids. These were, they were babies and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=131.92s)]
*  it's rough stuff. It's rough stuff. And it looked like they were celebrating as they were bringing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  the bodies back. And you know, it's the scene is not even believable, Brian, when you see what's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=144.16s)]
*  happening, it's sort of not even believable. It would, it's so barbaric. You wouldn't think [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=149.44s)]
*  that could happen in a modern age, but it happened. You dropped off 2000 pound bombs to them that they [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=155.27999999999997s)]
*  had ordered a while ago. You said, basically you're not going to tell them not to go into any [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=161.2s)]
*  province. What Joe Biden was saying, don't go into Rafa. You better stop humanitarian aid here [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=165.6s)]
*  threatening with sanctions. You have a different approach. It's prime minister. Do what you have to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  do. So he's got the toy. He's got this is such a fun to analyze the situation because liberals turn [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=174.72s)]
*  around and be like, see, at least Joe Biden did something. And it's like, yeah, I wonder what the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  outcome of Joe Biden's supposed red line looked like. I will forever repeat this with some notable [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=188.32s)]
*  exceptions. The major difference between Donald Trump's foreign policy and Joe Biden's is that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump says the quiet part out loud. Okay. Democratic administrations and maybe even former [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=202.32s)]
*  Republican administrations in the pre-Trump era, at least had some semblance of tact. They applied [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  a degree of tact and wanted to at least try and manufacture consent for their position [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=217.2s)]
*  or try to bring their audiences on board by, you know, hitting a couple political points that their [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=223.28s)]
*  audiences supposedly cared about. Like in order to justify, in order to justify further militancy in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  Afghanistan, many liberals turned around and said, well, one, Joe Biden did the wrong thing here by [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  pulling out and two, what will happen to the Afghan women implying that the only way to ensure [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=245.28s)]
*  that a feminist principles is by being under permanent military occupation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=251.6s)]
*  Got the decision to make, do I worry about the 30 plus hostages that may still be alive [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=256.16s)]
*  or do I finish off a terror organization that's trying to destroy you? Are you okay either way? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=262.0s)]
*  I am. I really am. It's, you know, when you see what's happening here, it's a hard thing to say. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=268.32s)]
*  You just wonder the condition of the hostages that they have. One group came in so bad, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=275.28s)]
*  looked like it was concentration camp and, and German terrible, terrible thing. When I looked at [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  then the other day, I wonder why, I wonder why people that leave Gaza look like they're leaving [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  our concentration camp. The only way these guys will recognize that Gaza is an open air prison [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=293.44s)]
*  is if there are Israelis who are malnourished inside of it. Yeah. No shit, Donald. You're not [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=300.56s)]
*  wrong. I mean, which was not as bad, actually not really close closely as bad, but I think really a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  lot of the people they have are in such bad shape. They're so violent and vicious. I think a lot of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  people, if you, if you look, I think they're in really bad shape. I really do. I think they're [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=318.0s)]
*  trying to give the best ones first. And if the best ones are the ones I'm saying they're in really [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=324.08s)]
*  bad shape. Sometimes you have to make a decision. You know, it's a, it's a decision that has to be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=329.12s)]
*  made. It's a rough decision, but the scene yesterday was really terrible because you're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  talking about babies. There's, and Mr. President, there's no scenario with this. This is really a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=340.4s)]
*  low level. This is no scenario where there's a two state solution anymore. I know Mike Woltz, your [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  National Security Advisor says there's no way Hamas is in charge there. So there, this seems [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=352.08s)]
*  a, it seems like we're the ultimate impasse. Your idea of taking over Gaza, making it more [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=357.6s)]
*  international, but wasn't necessarily well received by Jordan or Egypt. So what's next? Do you know? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=363.68s)]
*  Well, we paid Jordan and Egypt a lot of billions of dollars a year. And I was a little surprised [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=371.36s)]
*  they'd say that, but they did. Yeah. I wonder why I'll tell you the way to do it. I wonder why you [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  pay Jordan and Egypt billions of dollars a year. It's true. Let's think why if they had the capacity [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=382.8s)]
*  to carry out without any sort of political repercussions, Egypt and Jordan would willingly [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  do it. Okay. Their morality, the morality of the leadership does not play a role in this equation. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=396.16s)]
*  That's it. That's it. It's the same reason why you give them billions of dollars so they can be a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=402.0s)]
*  part of the security cooperative agreement that defends Israel every step of the way. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=408.16s)]
*  But the delicate balance for all Arab nations is the consistent threat of their population [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  rising up and rebelling against them. And there is nothing that will cause their populations to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  revolt more than actively throwing away the Gaza cause. There is no amount of weapons that you can [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=431.12s)]
*  deliver to the Egyptian military that will be able to actively suppress a revolt in Egypt. This is [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=439.52s)]
*  the major reason as to why they say, Mr. President, we would love to do this, but we can't. That's it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=447.36s)]
*  He does not understand it. He's too transactional and too stupid to recognize that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=454.24s)]
*  And when you are the American empire, in a lot of instances, you can get away with forcing, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  forcing people to do whatever you want. It doesn't take a, it doesn't take a brilliant man to be able [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=465.68s)]
*  to make vassal states do your bidding. This is simply one of those circumstances where the threat [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=472.4s)]
*  is existential. That's it. It is my plan. I think that's the plan that really works, but I'm not [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  forcing it. I'm just going to sit back and recommend it. And then the U S would own the site. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=484.16s)]
*  It'd be known, no Hamas, and it'd be developed. And then you start all over again with a clean [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=491.36s)]
*  plate. Right. Another way of doing it, but I don't think it would work would be to do it [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=496.8s)]
*  with people there. But I just don't see that working. I mean, it's been, it's been so many [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=502.32s)]
*  years, so many decades of, of on that site. That is one dangerous place. And Hamas would be there, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=508.56s)]
*  I guess, depending on what happens over the next little while. But the question is, can you wipe [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=515.52s)]
*  them all out? You know, they're so interspersed among people and it's certainly not an easy thing [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=521.2s)]
*  to do. But I liked my plan. I thought my plan was good. You get them out, you move them, you build [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=526.48s)]
*  a beautiful community and a permanent community. And you then take the site, the Gaza strip, you [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=531.6s)]
*  take Gaza and you, it's really essentially leveled. Now you don't have too much to do other than, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, remove debris. It's really that, that, that place is not livable. And if you gave the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=545.12s)]
*  people a choice between that and living in a nice community, I think I know where they'd go, but [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=552.08s)]
*  we'll, we'll see what happens. I thought it was, I thought it was great. Cause the location is, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=556.88s)]
*  you know, it's a great location. I don't know why. Why wouldn't they want to live in a rebuilt Gaza [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=562.56s)]
*  when it's a really nice community? Why must they leave for this rebuilding to take place? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  It makes no sense. This is good. No, or at least a step in the right direction. Trump's saying he [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=573.76s)]
*  won't force it. Yeah. He's a dumb ass and an absolute monster. And I must reiterate that it [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=577.44s)]
*  is not because people with sound morals reached him. They probably communicated to him why, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=587.6s)]
*  what he's suggesting would not, why it would not work logistically, why it would not work politically, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=596.08s)]
*  why it could not work militarily without American boots on the ground. And I suspect that that is [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=604.24s)]
*  probably why he's not forcing the issue. That's it. I suspect the people who told them that it's [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=609.28s)]
*  not going to happen are most likely the Saudis. That's the only, that's the only group of people [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  that he'll listen to in the region. Aside from the Israelis, I'm sure that the Israelis would love [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=619.04s)]
*  to force, to force Trump's hand into actively engaging militarily in Gaza. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=625.2s)]
*  Israel ever gave that up? Why did they give it up? I guess they look at us and say, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=631.2s)]
*  why did you give up the Panama Canal, right? Right. It's all connected. Ariel Sharon [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=636.08s)]
*  decided to do that. I can't believe it. You look down on a map, they have the whole ocean. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  And somebody from Israel, I guess, you know, I can tell you who, but who's well known, but he [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=644.08s)]
*  decided to give it up. Yeah. It's one of the, it's one of the, it's one of the bad real estate deals. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=650.24s)]
*  I see a lot of bad real estate deals. That's one of them right there. So, Ms. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=656.08s)]
*  So I'm going to have more about Ukraine. We have so much more to talk about about the economy. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=660.72s)]
*  We all have that straight ahead. Presidents saying whatever BB wants, he should go do. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  He's got the 2000 pound bombs and you have the horrible situation with the slow let go [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=668.96s)]
*  of all the hostages. You listen to Brian Kilmechel, my interview with president Trump, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=673.52s)]
*  exclusive to us for this hour. Don't move. Now we talked to you about Hamas and the whole horrific [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=678.4s)]
*  situation with, with the hostages and what he would do. And essentially BB's got a green light. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=683.9200000000001s)]
*  Now I talk about the number one story in the world and that's Ukraine. I hate to say this [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=688.0s)]
*  because I love this man, not Brian, but he's kind of given Walton Goggins here. Tell me I'm wrong. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=692.08s)]
*  We all are big Walton heads. Okay. I am a huge, huge Walton Goggins head. He kind of looks like [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=698.56s)]
*  him, baby Billy in the president's view. And you'll be interested to hear what he really [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=705.2s)]
*  thinks happened to start this war. Watch president cover of every newspaper just about is your stance [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=710.88s)]
*  in Ukraine. I was looking up, I almost found no indications that you said anything bad about [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=715.76s)]
*  Zelensky up until the last few days. And it seems as though when he didn't take the mineral deal [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=721.68s)]
*  and was critical of you for having, having a delegation talk in Saudi Arabia with Russia, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=726.24s)]
*  that was a turning point. Yeah. I wonder why he would say no to the mineral deal, dude. That's [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=731.28s)]
*  crazy. That's crazy. I can't believe the leader of a sovereign nation said no to just simply [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=735.4399999999999s)]
*  giving all of their fucking natural resources to a foreign country. Wow. Also he's going to say [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=745.44s)]
*  yes. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter, but it's shocking. It's shocking to me [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=753.44s)]
*  that he would say such a thing. It's also shocking that Trump would say such a thing openly [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  point for you. Correct. I've been watching this man for years now as his cities get to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=766.8800000000001s)]
*  demolish, as his people get killed, as the soldiers get decimated, where you have old, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=775.28s)]
*  you have old men and young men. You have men that are too old to fight, men that are too young to [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  fight. I've been watching this for years and it's a war that shouldn't have started. I know because [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=786.64s)]
*  I was there and I had it, it didn't start, it would have never started. If, if I won the election, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  which I did, it's a war that never, ever would have started. So I've been watching for years [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=798.4s)]
*  and I've been watching him negotiate with no cards. He has no cards and you get sick of it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=805.28s)]
*  You just get sick of it. And I've had it. And he then made a deal with us for rare earth and things [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=812.56s)]
*  then who knows what rare earth. He's such a caddy bitch. Like the New York Broadway queen comes out [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=822.48s)]
*  of him when he's like, I've had it. I've had it with him. Whatever rare earth means. I don't know. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  It's worth, you know, but at least it's something and who knows what it's worth. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=834.96s)]
*  Who knows if they even have it, but we made a deal with rare earth and secretary of treasury, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=838.8s)]
*  a very good guy actually went there. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=845.92s)]
*  What do you mean? Who knows, bro? You know, like why does he say who knows if they have rare earth [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=849.6s)]
*  minerals or not? You're the president of the United States of America. You don't have anybody [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=854.16s)]
*  telling you whether or not they have valuable resources. I'm certain I could figure it out [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=860.16s)]
*  with Google. And they couldn't even come close to getting a deal done. And frankly, I wish he [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=865.28s)]
*  didn't go there waste all of his time like that, but they couldn't get close. They met. Right. And [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=873.8399999999999s)]
*  then when he wanted to get it closed, he was unable to meet him again. But so just a wasted [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=880.56s)]
*  trip, a dangerous trip to I didn't like it that he was doing it because, you know, he's a good man. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=888.32s)]
*  I didn't want him to be put himself under danger because I had a feeling something like that would [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=894.1600000000001s)]
*  happen. But look what you have. You have a man who's led a country that had the most US provided [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=898.24s)]
*  $185 billion worth of defense to Ukraine. 75% of it went to us weapons manufacturers. And we act [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=905.6800000000001s)]
*  like there's a bill Ukraine still needs to pay or losses. We need the recoup. Yeah, it's very [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=911.7600000000001s)]
*  fucked up. They actively paid for it by having their people be slaughtered. If you honestly and [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=916.88s)]
*  earnestly wanted to defend Ukraine, you would just give them those weapons. You're already [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=924.16s)]
*  literally giving them the money to purchase the weapons. And those weapons are getting bought by [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=928.56s)]
*  the military industrial complex. And then they turn around and say, well, our arsenal is diminished. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=934.56s)]
*  Now we need to also get more subsidies and more taxpayer dollars to rebuild our arsenal. It's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=940.08s)]
*  crazy. Beautiful cities that they demolished had the most beautiful domes. Those domes are the most [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=946.56s)]
*  beautiful in the world. But that's Russia's fault. Russia, the smallest thousand year old domes. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=952.56s)]
*  And everything's demolished. Okay. Brian, Brian found his nuts. Okay. Respect. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=959.52s)]
*  There was like a demolition site though. It's sort of like Gaza. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=965.6s)]
*  In fact, will he say it again? He didn't get the memo. No, no chatters. This is the difference [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=969.76s)]
*  between Trump and a regular Republican. Okay. This is one of the few, this is one of the few [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=976.48s)]
*  standout aspects of the Trump administration that is truly different. Do you understand? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=986.4000000000001s)]
*  Normal Republicans, if it wasn't Trump, it was anybody else. They would never talk like this. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=992.32s)]
*  They would say, we have to be realistic. We have to go to the table to do a ceasefire. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=997.84s)]
*  Ukraine has run out of manpower. Let's be realistic here. And that's it. But they would [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1002.72s)]
*  never blame Ukraine. Like Marco Rubio, if he, if it wasn't, if he wasn't working as a Donald Trump's [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1008.4s)]
*  dog, would never say anything that, that holds Ukraine responsible for its, for its nation state [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1016.16s)]
*  being invaded by Russia, because it's also ridiculous to state that like Marco Rubio got [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1026.24s)]
*  99 votes in the Senate confirmations for a reason. He's a regular fucking Republican, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1031.04s)]
*  which means he's a China Hawk. He's a Russia Hawk. He's a Hawk through and through. Okay. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1036.48s)]
*  This is the one area where Donald Trump is definitely different than the rest of the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1044.16s)]
*  Republican party as well. Not a Russia Hawk anymore. Come on, bro. That's what I'm trying [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1051.52s)]
*  to say. They are trying to play catch up. They are trying to actively play defense. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1056.16s)]
*  It is not that they truly fucking have or resentment towards Russia. Okay. It is simply [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1061.76s)]
*  because they have one American forum policy, right? Like they're pushing always and forever, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1069.36s)]
*  but also simultaneously, they got Trump to have to deal with. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1076.8799999999999s)]
*  In fact, it's more, at least Gaza has a couple of buildings standing. This place, you take a look at [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1080.4799999999998s)]
*  demolition of so many of those cities and it, and all those, those people are killed. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1088.8s)]
*  Come on, Brian, repeat the question, Brian. But Mr. President, that's all this. That's [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1094.32s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's fault. I get, I get tired of listening to it. I'll tell you what I've seen it [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1097.92s)]
*  enough. And then he complains that he's not at a meeting that we're having with. Okay. Number two, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1102.5600000000002s)]
*  come on, Brian, but the Arabia trying to intermediate a piece. Well, he's been at meetings for three [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1108.24s)]
*  years with a very, uh, with the president who didn't know what the hell he was doing. He's been [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1114.0s)]
*  in the meetings for three years and nothing got done. So I don't think he's very important to be [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1120.64s)]
*  at meetings. To be honest with you, he's been there for three years. He's, he makes it very [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1125.12s)]
*  hard to make deals, but look what's happened to his country. It's been demolished, but no, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1129.6s)]
*  no, I hear you. Mr. President, you know, who's to blame for that. That's why I'm here. It's [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1134.3999999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Putin that did the invasion unwarranted to try to take back land. They had no right to, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1138.8799999999999s)]
*  and those you think fundamentally that's that. And there's something very funny [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1145.12s)]
*  about Brian. Kill me trying to actively get Trump to say things that will at least quiet the, the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  people so he can turn around and be like, see Donald Trump doesn't like Vladimir Putin. He's [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1159.92s)]
*  like, this is Alex Jones telling Kanye West not to say he loves Adolf Hitler as Kanye West keeps [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1164.4s)]
*  repeating that he loves Adolf Hitler. That's what this back and forth is. Make no mistake. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1170.8000000000002s)]
*  However, because of Trump's relentless attitude and perhaps his senility, he just keeps saying [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1177.52s)]
*  he loves Adolf. He doesn't give a fuck. Brian is, and it comes across like as though Brian is doing [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1186.32s)]
*  contentious reporting. He's not, these guys don't do adversarial journalism. They don't do [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1191.9199999999998s)]
*  adversarial journalism. He's trying to give Trump an out. He's like, Mr. President, the right thing [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1200.0s)]
*  to say in this situation is that Vladimir Putin is ultimately responsible. And he's just like, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1206.56s)]
*  ah, I hate Zelensky. And if you could just, and now, now both sides want to talk, it seems. So we [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1212.1599999999999s)]
*  should just get to that point. They only want to talk because of me. If I wasn't involved, they [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1218.1599999999999s)]
*  wouldn't be talking to each other. And Russia would continue to go through Ukraine because they are [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1223.28s)]
*  going through Brian. They've taken a lot of land and Russia would continue the march through [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1229.6799999999998s)]
*  Ukraine. If it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be talking to. Okay. This is amazing. This is one of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1234.64s)]
*  the funniest moments of accidental journalism I've ever actually encountered in my entire life. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1240.48s)]
*  And it's happening under the Trump administration. And it's happening with one of, you know, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1246.3200000000002s)]
*  like with one of the biggest Dick riders, right? I mean, I guess you could say he was a Ron [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1251.68s)]
*  DeSantis guy. Perhaps this was the reason why he was around the Santa's guy. Cause remember, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1256.0s)]
*  I didn't forget as the number one Trump Stan. Okay. I Hassan Hassan, I would probably girl [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1260.3999999999999s)]
*  number one Trump Stan. Remember when Brian killed me was tossing that fucking baseball [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1268.1599999999999s)]
*  with Ron DeSantis and he put his hat in the ring for Ron DeSantis. I remember that I never forgot. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1274.0s)]
*  Okay. Maybe some others did. I don't forgive. And I don't forget Brian, you fucking Benedict [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  Donald piece of shit. Anyway, still though, of course he is still a Dick rider of the [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1286.48s)]
*  administration. And that's what's very funny about it is that a Dick rider, the administration is [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1292.16s)]
*  trying to defend Donald Trump and it's coming across because of Trump's inability to understand [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1296.8s)]
*  what's happening. It is coming across like he's doing adversarial journalism. Like I got you, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1302.56s)]
*  like you think Vladimir Putin invaded, right? Like that's he's responsible, right? Chop just [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1308.08s)]
*  boulders over it. He just fucking boulders over it. No care, no care or consideration. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1313.6s)]
*  That's not how things go around these parts. Okay. Oh, you thought this was a convo. You thought [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1320.24s)]
*  this was a two way street. You thought there was a, you thought I was going to sit here and listen [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1326.7199999999998s)]
*  to what you have to say and then respond to it. Fuck off. Amazing. I'm the only reason they're [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1330.24s)]
*  taught. No, I think that everybody agrees with that. We have McCrone coming to see you for France [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1336.1599999999999s)]
*  storm this week to move forward. They didn't do anything either. The war is going on. There's no [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1341.6799999999998s)]
*  meetings with Russia, no nothing. Right. You know, they haven't done anything. And I, if you know, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1347.6799999999998s)]
*  McCrone's a friend of mine and I've met with the prime minister and, and you know, he's a very [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1352.32s)]
*  nice guy, but nobody's done anything. And I've been watching this going for years and I'm doing [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1358.4799999999998s)]
*  it for one reason. I hate the killing. I hate to see those young people killed. They're not Americans. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1364.4799999999998s)]
*  Russians in Ukraine is I hate to see the killing. So I just saw the, the Polish president just [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1369.68s)]
*  tweeted and he essentially, he essentially told a Zelensky to, to go back and do it to get to peace. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1375.6s)]
*  And he just put that out a short while ago. So do you believe that the, that the Russians [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1384.6399999999999s)]
*  don't make me tell you about the human body thing again, Brian, don't do it. Ukraine is flat. It's [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1390.1599999999999s)]
*  all gravity flat land. The only thing that stops a bullet is a human's body. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1397.76s)]
*  I kind of love that dude. That one is so stupid and you know, he thinks it's hard. Like that is such a [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1406.96s)]
*  idiotic statement to make. And he thinks it goes so hard. So he just keeps repeating that along [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  with the domes, the domes, the beautiful domes. So is that Disney destroyed the domes. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1423.28s)]
*  Want a deal. And even though they're the aggressors in this situation, they want a deal because they've [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1429.52s)]
*  had that 700,000 casualties. They're losing 46,000 a month too. So do you believe they're since they [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1435.12s)]
*  were sincere in, in Saudi Arabia? Look, Russia and who is the Polish, are you talking about? Yeah. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1442.48s)]
*  Was it due to the put it out? Yes. Because you have different leaders. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1451.8400000000001s)]
*  Why does he talk to them? Why does he, why does he talk to Fox news commentators? Like, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1456.88s)]
*  like he's, they're doing a briefing for him. Like, Oh, which one was it? Dota. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1463.68s)]
*  Like you're the president dog. You should fucking know that. Like why, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1469.28s)]
*  why are you getting a morning briefing from Brian Kilmeade on the Fox news? Brian Kilmeade [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1473.2s)]
*  radio show weekdays from 9am to 12pm Eastern time. You can also find it at Brian Kilmeade show.com. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1480.96s)]
*  Bowled story interesting, but no, look, it's not ready. Russia did not attack during my [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1488.64s)]
*  administration, but I will say he hates Zelensky. He hates him. Wait, but so do you. What is he [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1496.0s)]
*  saying? Bro is not letting down from this position that it is actually zel Disney's fault that Ukraine [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1503.3600000000001s)]
*  was invaded. That is kind of a wild thing to just say. I think given American power, the reception [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1510.08s)]
*  of Trump's commentary on shit like this is more positive because the Brandon one, the Brandonian [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1517.36s)]
*  response to things like this, to, you know, world changing events unfolding has always come across [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1524.3999999999999s)]
*  as very weak. You know what I mean? It's just, it's ridiculous. The tremendous passion. You're lucky. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1531.4399999999998s)]
*  You don't hate people, Brian. You don't hate anybody. You've never, but I'll give you the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1537.52s)]
*  exact. Why do you, why do I think Trump is so anti-Zelensky because he literally, he 100%, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1542.8s)]
*  100% loves a lot of her Putin. Like he does. He likes a lot of her Putin. There is not like, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1550.56s)]
*  this is not me being a live. He likes a lot of her Putin in the same way that he likes Xi Jinping in [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1556.16s)]
*  the same way that he likes Kim Jong-un in the same way that he liked do tear tape. He likes [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1561.76s)]
*  strong men. He likes out of the one too. He likes strong men. And I don't mean like strong men. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1566.8s)]
*  I mean, like he likes autocratic strong men, authoritarian strong men. That's number one. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1573.36s)]
*  Number two, Zelensky did not play ball. Like Ukraine didn't play ball with Donald Trump when [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1579.12s)]
*  he wanted blackmail. Okay. So he hasn't forgotten that that was very frustrating for him. I think [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1584.48s)]
*  that he, to a certain degree blames the Ukrainian administration for the loss of the previous [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1590.96s)]
*  election. And also that he was embarrassed because he got, you know, obviously impeached over it [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1600.96s)]
*  because they did not just make up about a connection between Hunter Biden and Joe Biden. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1607.04s)]
*  Okay. And I think, I think last but not least, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1614.16s)]
*  I guess he, he, so he's a Russian asset. No, I don't think he's a Russian asset. No, no, no, no. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1624.96s)]
*  I'm not saying that. I'm not saying Trump is like a secret KGB agent or he's in a gay relationship [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1629.36s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin, but I think he likes Vladimir Putin in the same way that he very clearly likes [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1636.56s)]
*  Xi Jinping. Like he says it all the time. Do you think he likes China? No, he doesn't, but he likes [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1642.64s)]
*  Xi Jinping. Like he doesn't like China as a competitor. He doesn't like China as a foreign [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1650.0s)]
*  adversary. He hates China, but he really, he thinks he admires, he admires these people. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1655.3600000000001s)]
*  He admires their power. Yeah. Zelensky refused to manufacture everything. He's getting Hunter Biden. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1662.0s)]
*  Like I said, yes. Like not even Hunter Biden, but Joe Biden specifically. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1665.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think those are, those are massive reasons for why he's behaving like this. Like he thinks [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1669.76s)]
*  Zelensky should know his place. Like he's like, come on, you're a vassal. You're an asset to us. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1675.6000000000001s)]
*  You're a weapon. We, you're a weapon. We wield, you know? So he thinks like anyone talking out [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1682.08s)]
*  of turn against them is like ridiculous. I'm sure that if, I'm sure that if like Modi also [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1689.04s)]
*  said something similar, he would despise them too. I would say outside of like all, out of all of [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1697.6s)]
*  the authoritarian strongmen, you want to know who he doesn't like? And this is going to go, I think [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1703.4399999999998s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, ironically enough, regardless of all of the insane things that he's done for [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1707.9199999999998s)]
*  Israel, he does not like Benjamin Netanyahu. Oh, he doesn't like Maduro either. Yeah. But it's [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1713.4399999999998s)]
*  because Maduro has never glazed him. He's never had like a, he's never had any relationship with [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1719.9199999999998s)]
*  Maduro. Is there a leader there? Is there a leader that likes Donald Trump? Yeah, of course. There's [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1726.32s)]
*  plenty Shinzo Abe. Rest in peace, my goat. Shinzo Abe loved him and Trump loved him back. He doesn't [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1731.28s)]
*  like Maduro cause Obama has a soft hand with Venezuela and he wants to do the opposite of [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1739.1999999999998s)]
*  Obama as always. Not necessarily. Obama had a hard hand. I mean, I guess he had a soft hand [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1743.52s)]
*  with Israel too. They both had a soft hand against Israel. So it doesn't count, but didn't we find [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1749.84s)]
*  out recently, he low key likes Claudia. He did say some positive shit about Claudia, which was [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1754.88s)]
*  crazy. That was kind of cool. That was cool to hear. I was like, oh, there's a state of execution. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1759.68s)]
*  Nice people, Brian. You don't hate anybody. You've never, but it's mutual. I'll give you the exact [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1764.48s)]
*  read. He said, I suggest that president Salinski remain committed to the course of calm, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1769.8400000000001s)]
*  constructive cooperation with Donald Trump. I trust that goodwill and honesty from a former [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1773.68s)]
*  foundation of the U S negotiation strategy. I have no doubt that president Trump is guided by a deep [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1778.8000000000002s)]
*  sense of responsibility for global stability and peace. What is he doing? What is he getting mad? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1783.6s)]
*  Like what's happening? I'm going to read you again. Right. You don't hate anybody. You've never, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1790.24s)]
*  but it's mutual. I'll give you the exact read. He said, I suggest that president Salinski remain [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1793.76s)]
*  committed to the course of calm, constructive cooperation with Donald Trump. I trust that [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1798.9599999999998s)]
*  goodwill and honesty from a former foundation of the U S negotiation strategy. I have no doubt that [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1803.6799999999998s)]
*  president Trump is guided by a deep sense of responsibility for global stability and peace. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1808.96s)]
*  And he said he just spoke to Salinski. So are you expecting a call from, would you accept a call [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1821.92s)]
*  from Salinski today? Yeah, of course. I'm not playing games. I don't accept or not accept calls. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1826.88s)]
*  Of course I'll take a call from him, but he's been negotiating for three years. And just so you know, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1831.68s)]
*  when you say Russia was the attacker, yes, Russia was attacked. Russia attacked, but there was no [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1836.64s)]
*  reason for them to attack. You could have talked him out. You, there was no reason that he should [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1843.44s)]
*  have attacked. That whole thing was, was going on for years. There was no reason he was going in. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1849.76s)]
*  It should have never happened. That war should have never happened. And I'm telling you, the way [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1857.2800000000002s)]
*  they talked, I said, you know, these guys are going to go into a war. It's it's, this is a, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1864.08s)]
*  you know, every time I say, Oh, it's not Russia's fault. I always get slammed by the fake news, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1870.32s)]
*  but I'm telling you, Biden said the wrong things. Zalinsky said the wrong things. They got attacked [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1877.4399999999998s)]
*  by somebody that's much bigger and much stronger, which is a bad thing to do. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1884.08s)]
*  He's defending Putin. Like he's his boyfriend. Yeah. He fucking loves him, dude. He loves his ass. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1889.52s)]
*  He really do it. Call me Rachel Maddow. The way, the way I'm writing Yowie about the way I'm [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1897.6000000000001s)]
*  writing Wattpad fan fiction about Donald Trump, having gay sex with Vladimir Putin, not in a [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1904.08s)]
*  homophobic type of way, but in a tasteful way. You know what I'm saying? He does, he loves them. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1908.96s)]
*  So never have been a war and all those dead people shouldn't be dead. And all those cities [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1918.88s)]
*  shouldn't be demolished right now. So when the Zalinsky said, Oh, he wasn't invited to him. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1925.3600000000001s)]
*  I think what's really funny about this. He's right though. No dog. He's not right. If he was [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1932.0s)]
*  fucking honest about it, he would say former administrations have goaded Ukraine into thinking [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1939.44s)]
*  that they could take a strong militant stance against Russia or something. So even, even if, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1946.24s)]
*  even if you try to, even if you try to understand what he's saying and like, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1952.4s)]
*  you know, add a little bit of charity ability to Trump for some fucking weird reason, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1958.32s)]
*  it's still America that is more responsible than Ukraine. It's psychotic. There's okay. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1962.0s)]
*  Let me tell you something. Okay. If America can take Ukrainian natural resources, because Trump [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1967.68s)]
*  said so. All right. Then America is responsible for how much Ukraine thought they could defend [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1974.96s)]
*  themselves against Russian invasion. Okay. So even in that, even in his own new reality that [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1984.8000000000002s)]
*  he's invented, it is still obviously America's fault. And it's not, it's not Ukraine's fault [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1992.64s)]
*  at all. They got fucking invaded. It's insane meeting. I mean, it wasn't a priority because he [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=1997.0400000000002s)]
*  did such a bad job in negotiating so far. Number one, you shouldn't have had a war. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2003.2s)]
*  And if you did, it should have been solved and settled immediately. It could have been [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2008.56s)]
*  this present. I think you're a hundred percent right. There's two things. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2013.6000000000001s)]
*  Three years ago, the Zelensky made two mistakes in two, three days. He criticized you and then he [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2016.0800000000002s)]
*  criticized the meeting. And then he said, bro, this entire second half of the interview around Ukraine [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2021.52s)]
*  has been Brian kill me trying to desperately get Trump to say something, anything. One mean thing [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2027.84s)]
*  about Vladimir Putin. That is crazy. He's just like, please, Mr. President, sir, please say [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2034.64s)]
*  something bad about Vladimir Putin, please. And I'm walking away from the deal, which was, I think, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2041.52s)]
*  55% of their rare earth minerals. It would have allowed America to have a stake there and nobody [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2046.32s)]
*  would attack Ukraine if America had business there. Every time Brian's speech, dude, this is amazing. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2051.44s)]
*  They said that I think if both sides could, do you think the Russians should be celebrating [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2061.2000000000003s)]
*  right now because they hear the rhetoric coming from the white house? No, because of are you [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2066.48s)]
*  going to insult the person that you're trying to negotiate with? Why are you going to insult the [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2072.56s)]
*  person? I mean, I'm not expecting Donald Trump to turn around and be like, Vladimir Putin's a thug. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2077.04s)]
*  We're never going to talk to him. I don't think that's the appropriate thing to do, but to [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2082.0s)]
*  consistently take Vladimir Putin's position and also undermine Ukraine optically speaking is [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2085.7599999999998s)]
*  ridiculous. And it's also bad for the negotiations too. Like, come on, dude, it's it's fucking insane. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2094.4s)]
*  He at least has to maintain this presence that like, Ukraine has a seat at the table. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2102.8799999999997s)]
*  The fuck you're America. You're undermining America's power on the global stage by [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2107.3599999999997s)]
*  making yourself look like you're his dog. It's crazy. It is actually crazy. While on the one hand, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2113.4399999999996s)]

*  the maximalist position on the opposing side. I got out. They, I do. They, they found it impossible [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2137.6s)]

*  Trump on the other hand is 100% not playing ball. He just does not care. He just keeps steamrolling [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2197.12s)]

*  the endless foresight recruited a young blossoming real estate guy at the age of like 14 or however [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2281.12s)]
*  old Trump was in the eighties at this point. Okay. What was like 20 in his twenties? I don't know [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2290.56s)]

*  malleable and immediately come back and they're like, Oh, I didn't know you were a socialist [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2391.12s)]

*  dude. The assumption that the USSR was actively, the USSR actively planted the seeds of a Donald [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2411.12s)]
*  Trump presidency fucking 40 years ago is psychotic. I think this guy's going to cause the, I think [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2418.4s)]
*  he's going to cause a war and that's what happened. And I will tell you, Putin could have been talked [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2426.7200000000003s)]
*  out of that so easy, but they didn't know how to talk. So Mr. President had been talked out of that [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2437.92s)]
*  war so easy. You didn't know how to talk. They said all the wrong things and I'm, I'm not [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2442.88s)]

*  never happened. Putin would have never gone in. So president, you have some sway with him. You [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2456.48s)]
*  definitely talk to him more than probably anybody else in the world outside, but here's the thing. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2460.4s)]
*  They have taken it. Imagine how Keno that would be that the USSR defeated the U S and the grave. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2466.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. That would be kind of cool. Like I said, I think Donald Trump is secretly a mentoring [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2472.7200000000003s)]
*  candidate. He's not actually, he's not actually pro Russia. I think he's fucking pro China, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2478.8s)]
*  or at least that is what I believe in my heart. Because if he wanted, he'd get the whole country. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2486.8s)]
*  But he's paying a huge price. As you pointed out a couple of weeks ago, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2492.72s)]
*  they have taken about 20 political has the article about Trump in 87, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2496.4s)]
*  1987 Trump was dealing with Russia. No, he wasn't dealing with Russia. He was dealing with another [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2500.16s)]
*  country because it was a different, it was an entirely different country in 1987. Okay. Hello. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2506.08s)]
*  Is this really a thing that people are saying? Is this the new meta after listening to Bernie [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2514.48s)]
*  Sanders speech on the Ukraine talk? I don't think there's any voice in this country on how to settle [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2519.2799999999997s)]
*  foreign conflicts. God help us when we strike your honor to a coup in Venezuela. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2522.88s)]
*  Yeah. Or I have with China too. No, I think America is, is completely lost in the sauce [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2526.7999999999997s)]
*  when it comes to foreign policy. That's why I said, like, I wish there was, I wish there was [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2533.04s)]
*  like cranks still, you know what I mean? I wish that the, I wish that the Democrats were still [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2537.92s)]
*  an anti-war unconditionally anti-war party, which they never truly were, but at least like [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2545.84s)]
*  aesthetically they tried to claim that they were anti-war. Now they're the pro war party. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2549.92s)]
*  And I really wish that we had more cranks in general that were like, like I said, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2553.92s)]
*  they were anti-war. The only grace I could give this conspiracy theory is that Russia did keep [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2558.08s)]
*  some of their former Soviet intelligence assets. You have Vladimir Putin, but sounds really walking [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2561.76s)]

*  for being a violent commie pro-terrorism shill. Your career with the new FBI in charge is cook, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2578.64s)]

*  And I really hope that Trump's FBI throws you in jail. Like how none of this makes sense, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2626.32s)]
*  but you can't have these conflicting opinions in your mind at the same time. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2632.2400000000002s)]
*  At a certain point, you have to arrive at a certain point. You have to arrive at a, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2640.48s)]
*  a conclusion that like, maybe you have no political perspectives at all any longer. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQAPHfd9TY&t=2647.2000000000003s)]
