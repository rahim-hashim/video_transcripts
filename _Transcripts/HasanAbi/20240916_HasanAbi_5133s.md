# Revealing The Identity Of Trump's Shooter | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0)
*  Anyway, this is the earliest thing that we could find about him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=0.0s)]
*  Ryan Ruth was 36 at the time was arrested without incident at 1am at Monday at [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2.92s)]
*  United roofing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=7.84s)]
*  Ruth was pulled over about 10pm Sunday during a traffic stop, but he put his [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=9.72s)]
*  hand on on a firearm and drove to United roofing where he remained barricaded [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  inside. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=18.0s)]
*  Anyway, let's get back to his interview in Newsweek in Romania. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=23.96s)]
*  So the question as far as why I'm here, to me, you know, a lot of the other [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=27.68s)]
*  conflicts are gray, but this conflict is definitely black and white. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=33.24s)]
*  This is about good versus evil. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=36.72s)]
*  This is a storybook, you know, any movie we've ever watched, this is definitely [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=38.96s)]
*  evil against good. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=42.92s)]
*  I mean, we're battling a situation here where, you know, the Ukrainians and the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=44.92s)]
*  rest of the world are caring and kind and, and generous and unselfish and, and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=49.88s)]
*  take care of one another. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=56.12s)]
*  And it's just a matter of, you know, we need to stand up for that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=57.32s)]
*  That is the most important thing in the world is just to show human beings that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  we're kind and we're caring and that we take care of one another and that the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=65.06s)]
*  world is united so that we feed each other and make sure that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=68.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=72.8s)]
*  His hair is blue and yellow because of the Ukrainian flag, I think. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=73.0s)]
*  You know, we all move forward as, as one collective. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=76.08s)]
*  So he clearly doesn't think Trump would have stopped the invasion. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=79.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=81.92s)]
*  I don't think he thinks Trump would have stopped the invasion at all. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=83.32s)]
*  It kind of feels to me like he thinks Trump is being very mean to Zelensky [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  and is probably, I think this guy became the funniest part. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=91.84s)]
*  The funniest part of this is I think he became a Russia gator after Russia gate. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=95.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=100.16s)]
*  I think he became a Russia gate guy, like far, far after Russia gate was like [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=101.16s)]
*  even a thing, like after MSNBC was like, all right, nevermind. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=107.96s)]
*  We investigated a lot of the stuff. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=110.84s)]
*  There was a lot of like weirdly pro Israel accounts involved in the election [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  interference. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=116.4s)]
*  We're just going to stop talking about this altogether. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=117.04s)]
*  And he became a Russia gator way too late to the game because like, cause he [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  voted for Trump in 2016, according to his own admission on his Twitter. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=124.04s)]
*  So I think that this dude might've actually been hired by Ukraine. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=129.44s)]
*  Does this okay? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=133.08s)]
*  Calm down, dude. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=133.6s)]
*  No, that's not what happened. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=134.4s)]
*  No, this is, this is a man who was, I think acting out on his own. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=136.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=140.0s)]
*  This is a guy who literally, this is a guy who literally was insane. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=140.72s)]
*  A real go getter. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=146.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=147.52s)]
*  The community found his telegram. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=148.24s)]
*  That's crazy that y'all found his telegram. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=150.08s)]
*  Last seen on September 13th. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=153.36s)]
*  Won't be on there any longer. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=155.4s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=156.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=157.8s)]
*  I don't think Ukraine hired him, but I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=158.6s)]
*  He might think Ukraine hired him. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=161.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Like, and yeah, this is, this is the like earliest thing that we found [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=165.68s)]
*  about him, man with barricades, self inside of business. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=170.16s)]
*  He is from, I think this is literally where he's from. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=173.64s)]
*  Originally Reddit knows him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=176.96s)]
*  Have you contacted Ryan Ruth? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  He had a volunteer information center and kept track of all the international [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=180.6s)]
*  volunteers with little Ukrainian flags with each other's name on the my Don. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=183.24s)]
*  Ryan Ruth is a pest who tries to get around official Ukrainian army policy, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=187.24s)]
*  misrepresented himself and tried to get a number of a Syrian Afghanistan, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=190.72s)]
*  Afghani citizens into the Legion. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=193.8s)]
*  Avoid him. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  He helped a few of my friends find units last year when the Legion had really [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=196.44s)]
*  strict requirements for a while. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=199.88s)]
*  I do believe you about the Syrians and Afghans though. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=201.56s)]
*  Most of what he does is help international volunteers join a unit. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=203.96s)]
*  So he should still be in contact with most of them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=206.56s)]
*  He may do good things. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=209.2s)]
*  He also put Ukrainian recruiters names and phone numbers on his personal blog. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=210.68s)]
*  Without permission. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=213.84s)]
*  They found out when random people began messaging them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=214.88s)]
*  He also got salty when there were security lock. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=218.04s)]
*  Why the Ukrainians, the pro Ukrainian subreddit knowing who this guy is, is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=220.0s)]
*  insane. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=225.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=226.84s)]
*  I think this guy just has a very like one things that we know about Ryan Ruth. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=227.52s)]
*  He's a real go getter. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=233.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  If he, if he puts his, if he puts his mind to something, he's going to go out [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=235.88000000000002s)]
*  and do it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=240.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=241.36s)]
*  He's going to go out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=242.08s)]
*  He went to Ukraine. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=244.44000000000003s)]
*  He literally went to Ukraine. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  He also personally, I think tried to start a business in Hawaii to build [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  houses for homeless people in Hawaii. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=252.72000000000003s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=253.36s)]
*  Kaua Hale homeless concept generating offers of donations among them was a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  Kailua couple that pledge 40,000 to fund the construction of more tiny homes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=259.08s)]
*  Ryan Ruth, the owner of Camp Box, Honolulu, which builds storage units and tiny [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=263.44s)]
*  houses at his donation of a tiny house allows him to use his expertise to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=267.08s)]
*  address a larger problem. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=270.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=271.32s)]
*  It seems he lived in Greensboro, North Carolina and moved out of the state in [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=271.84s)]
*  2020. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=274.84s)]
*  I think he also, I think he also, not only did he live in Greensboro, but he [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=275.96s)]
*  also had a house in Hawaii as well. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=283.08s)]
*  Cause he mentioned that he has an empty house in Hawaii because he wanted to, he [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=285.32s)]
*  wanted to bring, I can't believe I'm saying this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=289.68s)]
*  He wanted to bring Kim Jong-un to his house as a guest to talk to him. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=292.84s)]

*  Local municipalities and states cannot continue to be allowed to provide their [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=305.84s)]
*  own oversight on law enforcement. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=310.4s)]
*  It is a gross conflict of interest. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=312.23999999999995s)]
*  The federal government must be compelled to always be the legal review of police [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=314.56s)]
*  action. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=318.71999999999997s)]

*  He is in a New York Times article. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=324.12s)]
*  We're going to talk about that in a second. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=325.4s)]
*  I'm confused. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=326.76s)]
*  Is this a good dude or not in the USMC? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=327.4s)]
*  A lot of guys don't really trust the Marine that hasn't had to stand tall [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=329.64s)]
*  before a man at least once by this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, some sort of run with the UCMJ. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=333.52s)]
*  This guy at least does sound like he gets done. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=335.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm confused. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  He's quite eccentric, but he's also very involved in helping international [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  volunteers in Ukraine. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=342.32s)]
*  So he probably knows your brother or at least knows people from his unit. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  This is his website. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=345.68s)]
*  You probably know he would probably know how to get help to word out about your [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=346.56s)]
*  missing friend. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=350.32s)]
*  I think he wanted to Kim Jong-un anyway. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=351.36s)]
*  This is the earliest thing that we could find about him. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=353.36s)]
*  Ryan Ruth was 36 at the time was arrested without incident at 1am at Monday at [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=355.92s)]
*  United roofing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=360.84s)]

*  His attitude toward in Ukraine, the fact that he claims he fought there and was recruiting [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=599.04s)]
*  people to go fight. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=605.8s)]
*  Does that make it a motive? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=607.5999999999999s)]
*  Not necessarily, but it's certainly something that's going to cause them to want to take a [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=608.68s)]
*  deeper look at that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=612.68s)]
*  And again, the social media aspect of this. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=613.92s)]
*  I mean, he's 58 years old and does have a social media footprint. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=617.12s)]
*  Not that older people don't, but, you know, it shows that he's very active on social media. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=621.76s)]
*  He did have a GoPro, so he was planning on filming himself and he wanted to leave that [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=628.8s)]
*  behind, in my opinion, if he had been successful. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=633.8s)]
*  And so all these things are, I think, important clues. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=638.36s)]
*  But the most important clues are going to come from the execution of those search warrants and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=642.08s)]
*  the evidence they're able to gather from his home, a business, interviewing friends, family, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=645.8s)]
*  smartphones, all those kinds of things. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  That's where the evidence is going to really come from. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=653.64s)]
*  And that's what they're actively working right now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=656.24s)]
*  And now that his name is out there, obviously, there's going to be a lot of interest in [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=658.92s)]
*  tracking down friends and relatives of this individual. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=664.92s)]

*  This is something that was briefed to the Trump campaign. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=697.24s)]
*  I should note and I want to be very clear here, we don't know that this new intelligence [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=700.68s)]
*  and this new briefing that the Trump campaign got about this attempt by Iran to escalate [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=704.96s)]
*  its attack on Donald Trump. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=710.24s)]
*  Is it all related to the second attempt that happened today on his golf course? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=711.76s)]
*  But it does speak to the threat environment. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=716.76s)]
*  So what do you mean Iran? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=718.96s)]
*  What are these people are? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=720.52s)]
*  Goddamn, CNN, dude, dude, dude, that is crazy. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=721.64s)]
*  Just want to get back to you, Andrew McCabe, on this reporting. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=727.36s)]
*  And while we don't know that has anything to do with with what happened today, what it [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=730.56s)]
*  says about overall what what the Secret Service and Homeland Security and officials are [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=735.8s)]
*  taking into account. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=741.8s)]
*  And what it tells us, it gives us a very small insight into a very, very troubling, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=742.92s)]
*  complicated, diverse threats that are facing our political leadership today. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=749.1999999999999s)]
*  And the fact that they've been briefed on these threats means that the intelligence [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=756.88s)]
*  community considers them credible and reliable and things that they feel like the Secret [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=762.36s)]
*  Service and those engaged in protecting the former president really need to take action [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=768.92s)]
*  on. And so this brings us back to the conversation we had a little while ago where we were [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=773.56s)]
*  commenting on how is it that this could happen two times in just a couple of months and [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=778.32s)]
*  that someone could get this close to the president from, you know, just kind of poking in [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=784.28s)]
*  from from through the through the fence at the golf course. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=788.92s)]
*  There is always a tension between protectees and the protective service, particularly [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=791.7199999999999s)]
*  when the protectee is someone who's running for office. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=797.48s)]
*  They want to be available. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=800.16s)]
*  This is so Iran makes the most sense, though they must avenge Qassem. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=802.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, Iran doesn't make sense at all in this situation. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=806.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=808.88s)]
*  This guy is so heavily invested in like NATO. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=809.92s)]
*  I think what's really funny about this, what's really funny about like Americans looking [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=814.68s)]
*  at a situation that is like so unique to the United States of America and being like [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=821.2s)]
*  someone else must be responsible for this. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=826.92s)]
*  No, dude, we're responsible for this. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=829.24s)]
*  Only in the United States of America could you find a guy that is such a goddamn crank [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=832.04s)]
*  that he was like pro-Tulsi Gabbard, pro-Trump in 2016, vehemently anti-Trump and like the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=836.92s)]
*  most invested in both housing the homeless and also simultaneously nuking Moscow in an [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=843.84s)]
*  effort to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=851.4s)]
*  This is our people. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=853.24s)]

*  roofing company's roof, ironically enough, in his roofing company's office with an [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=861.24s)]
*  automatic machine in his hand after being chased by the police. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=866.6s)]
*  Like this is someone who you can only find in America. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=871.0s)]

*  OK, 58 year old man unit. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=966.96s)]
*  So, you know, we feel the pain of one country's failure and their conflicts, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=969.76s)]
*  and we enjoy the successes of other countries that are doing good. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=974.6s)]
*  And we all work together. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=978.6s)]
*  And for some reason, Russia does not grasp this concept that we're we're all one unit. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=980.12s)]
*  And we have to get along and work together and and and and be normal human beings. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=986.0s)]
*  This is 2022. We have to work together. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=992.2s)]

*  understand the concept of of being unselfish and being generous and being kind. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1001.92s)]
*  And just the basic moral values that are required by human beings these days. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1008.96s)]
*  It blows my mind. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1014.64s)]
*  And what are you doing here in Ukraine? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1015.64s)]
*  My initial goal was to come and fight. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1018.92s)]
*  I think, you know, everybody around the globe should be motivated. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1021.4s)]
*  He was not allowed to fight, by the way, for I love that, like a guy who is standards, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1024.3600000000001s)]
*  like a military that is very desperate for foreign volunteers, still looked at this guy [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1030.16s)]
*  and was like, no, dog, we can't give you. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1036.04s)]
*  But in the goddamn US of a he can have all the needs. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1038.1200000000001s)]
*  OK, that's the beauty of this country. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1042.52s)]
*  This failed the Ukrainian ASVAB. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1045.2s)]
*  OK, I don't even know how they conduct it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1047.96s)]
*  OK, I don't know how they conduct that over there. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1051.28s)]
*  But I do know that they're desperate for people. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1054.28s)]
*  OK, they're desperate for bodies. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1057.04s)]
*  And he was still not allowed. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1059.04s)]
*  He was still not allowed to serve in the Foreign Legion. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1061.76s)]
*  And and yet in the United States of America, he can have all the ones. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1064.48s)]
*  OK, God, this country, man, this country, we are such freaks, dude. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1069.88s)]
*  We are the freakish country, dude. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1076.32s)]
*  We are the most insane country. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1078.4s)]
*  A guy who was not allowed to carry out in Ukraine [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1081.72s)]
*  can just like do whatever he wants here. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1086.16s)]
*  They did come here and support the Ukrainians and support the army, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1089.04s)]
*  no matter what gender, age, anything, everybody should be here supporting the army. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1092.4s)]
*  But I'm 56. So initially they're like, well, I have no military experience. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1097.44s)]
*  So they're like, you're not an ideal candidate. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1102.28s)]
*  So they said not right this minute. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1104.5600000000002s)]

*  Oh, my God. Some chatters are so holy. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1159.52s)]
*  So plan B was to come here to give and promote getting more people here. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1162.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, we need thousands and thousands and thousands of people here [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1167.32s)]
*  fighting with the Ukrainians. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1170.92s)]
*  We need we need, you know, we've got one hundred and ninety countries around the world. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1172.16s)]
*  And we thousands from all of them. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1176.8s)]
*  If the governments will not send their official military, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1178.92s)]
*  then we civilians have to pick up the torch and make this thing happen. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1183.4s)]
*  And we've gotten some wonderful people here. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1187.28s)]
*  But it's a small fraction of the number that should be here. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1189.76s)]
*  If we have five thousand, you know, to to ten thousand people here fighting, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1193.08s)]
*  you know, that is just a minuscule amount of the five billion people on the globe. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1197.64s)]
*  You know, we need everyone here fighting. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1202.72s)]
*  That's that's why I'm in key. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1205.24s)]

*  We were at a critical juncture in this where we are sitting on the fence [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1212.16s)]
*  as far as whether good or evil is going to win. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1217.64s)]
*  You know, right now we're looking at a situation where the world is waning [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1220.08s)]
*  and it's and it's the thinking that this is important or not. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1224.44s)]
*  And we're at a point where, you know, all right, are we going to stand for humanity, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1228.2s)]
*  for human rights, for for everything that is good with the world? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1232.48s)]
*  Are we just going to ignore it? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1237.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, if we if everybody is complacent and doesn't join this this this fight, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1239.04s)]

*  And Eric Trump, it just so happens, was telling me earlier today [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1455.92s)]
*  with some top notch sharpshooters, some of the best in the country, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1460.68s)]
*  they were hitting targets from a mile away. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1465.8s)]
*  That ought to give people a little bit of perspective in terms of the [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1469.08s)]
*  what the perimeter needs to be for any top candidate or elected official. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1473.96s)]
*  The perimeter can't be three to five hundred yards because that is [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1481.0s)]
*  that's considered an easy by anybody that has any level of. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  Now, Eric was, to be honest, pretty emotional [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1488.8799999999999s)]
*  and said the words to me, how many more lives does my father have here [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1492.48s)]
*  in terms of, you know, he can only dodge so many bullets. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1498.52s)]
*  And he rightfully is upset and knowing firearms as well as he does, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1503.12s)]
*  he makes a compelling case. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1509.24s)]
*  And I'm going to put him on tomorrow night and he's going to describe this [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1510.52s)]
*  in his own way and how he felt. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1513.56s)]
*  The whole family has to be upset. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1515.88s)]
*  I remember the last time when this happened in Butler, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1518.32s)]
*  poor Baron Trump found out somebody ran over to him and said, your dad, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1521.8400000000001s)]

*  I don't think that's probably a very traumatic one for him [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1531.2s)]
*  and for the entire family. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1535.32s)]
*  And I feel I feel horrible for this family, for all that they have gone through. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1537.56s)]
*  So much of it has been unfair. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1541.04s)]
*  But is he crying on this? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1542.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, the president tends to shrug this off himself. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1545.56s)]
*  The president shook the hands, according to my friend, Steve Wittkopf, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1549.2s)]
*  of every single person that was out there protecting him. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1553.48s)]
*  He thanked every one of them for protecting him. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1556.9199999999998s)]
*  He was grateful to all of them. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1559.9199999999998s)]
*  And and that just happens to be the way it is. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1562.04s)]
*  He happens to be. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1564.84s)]
*  It's a side of him that I wish you would show more often to the American people. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1566.36s)]
*  And but that does not negate the question, Charlie. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1570.32s)]
*  And I think we're tracking on this very important issue. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1575.24s)]
*  You've got a tree line. You've got a fence. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1578.76s)]
*  You're only 300 yards away from where the of the presidential candidate, former. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1581.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I guess his boyfriend almost got again. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1586.72s)]
*  So that's probably why he's a little emotional. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1589.28s)]
*  Top notch Secret Service agent that that was able to [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1591.48s)]
*  stop that threat by taking his own. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1596.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, I don't know where we would be again today. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1600.04s)]
*  I mean, the top not Secret Service agent they miss dog. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1602.04s)]

*  He literally escaped the woods, got in his Nissan SUV and drove away. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1606.76s)]
*  I think there's a lot of questions that got to be answered. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1612.3999999999999s)]
*  This interim report that will be coming out from Congress, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1614.56s)]
*  I think is going to be very revealing. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1617.0s)]
*  Sean, it's Molly here. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1619.8s)]

*  security failures, the bravery, of course, of the people on the ground there, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1637.6799999999998s)]

*  That is a why won't people care about our big, beautiful. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1684.44s)]
*  Why won't people care about our big, beautiful president? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1688.24s)]
*  This is so frustrating. Why don't they care? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1691.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, they do. It seems they do care. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1694.3200000000002s)]
*  They just care in the opposite direction. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1696.3200000000002s)]
*  They care enough to like try and. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1698.44s)]
*  OK, maybe they should care less about the big, beautiful boy. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1700.64s)]
*  If you want them to not let the president level in this country [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1704.92s)]
*  has never been greater than it is right now. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1709.04s)]
*  And that it is coming from everywhere. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1712.2s)]
*  So that would tell me we need more resources, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1715.04s)]
*  not just for President Trump, but for every for the vice president, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1719.6s)]
*  for the president, and have some real impact on the election. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1724.04s)]
*  I don't think this will have like a major impact on the election. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1728.8s)]
*  It is because this guy's too much of a kook, too much of a crank. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1732.2s)]
*  People hate Donald Trump. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1737.28s)]
*  Like, I mean, he literally got Chad. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1739.52s)]
*  He got in the ear and it didn't have an impact on the election. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1742.32s)]
*  So I don't know why the rerun would have more impact. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1745.84s)]
*  At least this time, it's like actually by someone who is lived up [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1750.16s)]
*  and not like a registered Republican who was like, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1754.76s)]
*  I don't know if a president comes around to my neighborhood. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1758.2s)]
*  I might go and like that was the last guy. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1761.68s)]
*  But, you know, oh, he wasn't a registered Republican. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1765.24s)]
*  The last shooter was this guy was a. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1768.12s)]
*  OK, first of all, this guy was also a registered Republican. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1770.76s)]
*  It's just he was a registered independent afterwards, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1774.12s)]
*  or at least as a registered independent, he voted for Donald Trump in 2016. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1777.6799999999998s)]
*  But I'm pretty sure he I think he he voted for. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1782.0s)]
*  He's a former he's a former Trump Republican turned never Trump Republican. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1788.04s)]
*  Yeah, he did in 2016. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1792.1599999999999s)]
*  In 2016, he was for Trump. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1794.2399999999998s)]
*  At least his own admission. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1797.68s)]
*  He also didn't have an issue with like Vivek and Haley, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1799.88s)]
*  which I think is kind of weird. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1802.6000000000001s)]
*  But I guess he like thought that Nikki Haley was like pro NATO, which she is. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1803.96s)]
*  Right. And I think that was the reason why he was like [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1809.1200000000001s)]
*  saying like Nikki Haley, like you have to stay in the race until the very end. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1813.16s)]
*  But I don't know why he was pro-vivek because like Vivek is I thought [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1816.96s)]
*  Vivek was like I thought he was like super pro Russia, but like very anti China, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1820.44s)]
*  which so was this guy. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1825.0s)]
*  This guy was like super anti China and super anti Russia. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1827.24s)]
*  Like those are the most he is he is he has a litany of inherently contradictory positions, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1833.0800000000002s)]
*  which is very understandable for the average American. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1840.48s)]
*  Americans have like the dumbest positions. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1844.28s)]
*  But overall, overall, I think like if there's a couple things that are the high notes, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1846.64s)]
*  like things that he cared about the most, it's like pro Ukraine, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1851.68s)]
*  nuking Russia, pro NATO and pro Taiwan, super anti China, like super anti China and super duper. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1854.76s)]
*  What happened here again, because we're we cannot create a new normal around a president [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1863.68s)]
*  nearly being, but yet that's what happened last time. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1869.4s)]
*  Do you think this happens again here? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1872.48s)]
*  Well, Joe, you know, your your your media analysis is always spot on. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1873.96s)]
*  And I think you're right about this in more ways than you may know. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1879.1200000000001s)]
*  You're right. It kind of got pushed to the side and we've kind of been ignoring all of that. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1883.52s)]
*  And what really bothered me if we have unfortunately, sadly, tragically covered [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1888.32s)]
*  too many school shootings over the course of our careers, all of us on this program tonight. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1895.1200000000001s)]
*  And when you think about most of those school shootings, we know within hours who the person is. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1900.84s)]
*  We've identified where they stand politically on social media. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1907.8s)]
*  We start learning about their background. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1911.84s)]
*  Maybe they had trouble or problems or whatever it happened to be. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1914.36s)]
*  We know more within five hours than we learned in a month after Butler P.A. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1920.6399999999999s)]
*  And that is troublesome. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1926.6399999999999s)]
*  So I think that at the end of the day, that we really need we need more information [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1928.24s)]
*  and not less information when it comes to shootings like this. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1934.6s)]
*  And the media needs to not ignore this. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1937.2s)]
*  I don't want to see any elected official ever in any situation where they're threatened. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1939.8s)]
*  And this is not political for me in any way. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1946.16s)]
*  And I want our nation safe and secure. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1949.0s)]
*  And that's why I don't want defund, dismantle or no bail laws. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1951.4s)]
*  That's why I want a border wall. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1955.08s)]
*  That's why I want vetting for people coming into this country. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1957.48s)]
*  I want background checks. I want health checks. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1960.72s)]
*  I want a means test. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1963.16s)]
*  So you're not a financial burden on the American people. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1964.32s)]
*  These are simple solutions. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1967.2s)]
*  The American people will sort the political side of this out in 51 days. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1970.0s)]
*  But this has got to be a top of mind issue. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1974.52s)]
*  Our our safety, our our security in our towns and our cities at our border. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1978.2s)]
*  And I think America, I don't get it. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1984.8s)]
*  Who's the guy is like as American as you can get. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1986.56s)]
*  He was so American. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1990.8799999999999s)]
*  He was exercising his fundamental Second Amendment rights. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1992.08s)]
*  The people that have been are they just like, are they just assuming now? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=1995.0s)]
*  Are they just did they just collectively decide? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2001.4399999999998s)]
*  Let's just lie about who the shooter is like dog. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2004.3999999999999s)]
*  He's from North Carolina. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2008.0s)]
*  Like it don't get more American than that. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2010.12s)]
*  He is a white guy. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2012.32s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2014.48s)]
*  Like how is this the immigrants from free housing, health care, education [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2015.9199999999998s)]
*  and free sex change surgery for illegal immigrants? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2020.12s)]
*  And most Americans don't know this yet. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2023.92s)]
*  And voting starts early this week in Pennsylvania. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2027.0s)]
*  Now, that is a disservice from the media that you cut. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2030.72s)]
*  Wait, free housing, free health care for Americans like what? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2034.72s)]
*  I wish really, really fair choice in November. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2039.48s)]
*  They need to know about this. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2043.68s)]
*  Now, I'm going to make this challenge. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2046.0s)]
*  And for the record, when the Biden administration wouldn't give [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2047.76s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2051.2799999999997s)]
*  a Secret Service protection, even though I disagree with Robert F. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2053.12s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. in light of his family background, his uncle was his father was. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2057.04s)]
*  They were both. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2063.24s)]
*  They denied him Secret Service protection for the longest time until after [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2064.12s)]
*  the shooting in Butler. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2069.0s)]
*  And I had been advocating for him to get that the minute after he supported [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2070.4799999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump, that was it. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2074.8399999999997s)]
*  They took a Secret Service protection away. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2076.56s)]
*  That to me, they need a complete [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2079.08s)]
*  re-evaluation of who in the political arena needs support. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2082.12s)]
*  And one other issue that is political that I will bring up. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2088.6s)]
*  We need to re-examine what happened in the summer of 2020. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2092.44s)]
*  We had 574 riots. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2096.96s)]
*  We had dozens of dead Americans. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2099.24s)]
*  We had thousands of cops injured with bricks, rocks, bottles, molotov cocktails. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2101.32s)]
*  We had billions of dollars in property damage. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2106.9199999999996s)]
*  Vice President Walls would not call in the National Guard, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  opened up the windows of his family home to smell burning rubber, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2115.04s)]
*  the smell of freedom or whatever he called it. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2119.3199999999997s)]
*  And Kamala Harris, four days after a police precinct, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2121.8799999999997s)]
*  the Minneapolis was burned to the ground. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2125.08s)]
*  She was out tweeting out a bail fund to let the rioters out of jail, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2127.64s)]
*  then goes on with with Colbert and says, those rioters aren't going to stop. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2131.3999999999996s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. And we're not going to stop. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2136.68s)]
*  Well, where's Liz Cheney when you need her? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2139.68s)]
*  Because that kind of sounds like rioting and insurrection support. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2141.8799999999997s)]
*  So I think these are political issues that I know you're going to be talking about [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2145.6s)]
*  the rest of the hour. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2149.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, we will for sure. Sean, it's Alicia again. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2150.3599999999997s)]
*  I just have one more question. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2152.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm just wondering, you know, when there was a reporter in that news [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2154.56s)]
*  conference earlier who said that there were 25 of us referring to the reporters, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2158.0s)]
*  wondering how this was able to happen. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2161.44s)]
*  And then the sheriff said, you know, he's not the sitting president. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2163.3199999999997s)]
*  And the room that I was sitting in, everyone gasped. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2166.24s)]
*  Is this a moment for President Biden where he needs to where the onus is on him [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2169.2s)]
*  to go above and beyond all protocols and make a decision? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2174.2s)]
*  We're 50, 51 days from the election that Donald Trump needs [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2177.8399999999997s)]
*  the kind of protection that he deserves. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2181.24s)]
*  I think it's been a moment for them since Butler. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2182.8799999999997s)]
*  I think it was a moment. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2186.16s)]
*  And I think they should have had the common sense to give Robert F. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2187.4399999999996s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. in light of in light of what happened to his father [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2190.2s)]
*  and his uncle being he deserved Secret Service protection. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2194.68s)]
*  There were a few of us that were outspoken begging for it on his behalf, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2199.04s)]
*  even though I don't have a political agreement with him on a lot of issues. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2203.96s)]
*  I think that after Butler, there there was some improvement. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2210.0s)]
*  But how did somebody get within 300 yards of Donald Trump [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2214.7599999999998s)]
*  with a with a scoped AK-47 and have an ability come within really seconds of him again? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2221.2s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2230.04s)]
*  That is not for those that know. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2232.28s)]
*  You want to know how un-serious the situation is? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2234.52s)]
*  They're basically done talking about like how devastating it is for Trump [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2237.2400000000002s)]
*  and are now advocating for more funds to be allocated to Trump's Secret [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2241.64s)]
*  Service details so we can gulf. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2245.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2247.36s)]
*  Like my man had two hits, OK, one time it grazed them. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2248.48s)]
*  The second time the guy couldn't even fire off. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2253.48s)]
*  And like these guys are literally like, yeah, he should be able to golf [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2256.4s)]
*  in the privacy of his own private golf course. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2260.52s)]
*  And there should be like a one mile radius where there's no one [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2263.12s)]
*  that's ever been a registered Democrat around him. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2266.28s)]
*  It's like that's really that's the main point of concern for you. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2269.4s)]
*  Like, that's what you're actually worried about right now. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2273.76s)]
*  OK, you're not even taking this seriously. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2276.6s)]
*  Why the fuck should anyone else take this seriously? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2278.6400000000003s)]
*  And it's probably it's it's probably because like there's not really anything [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2280.6s)]
*  that you can say about this, because again, the dude is white. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2284.88s)]
*  OK, the dude was a white man. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2289.08s)]
*  So their their arguments kind of fall flat in this situation. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2291.44s)]
*  Not only is the dude a white man, but he had ease of access to. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2295.2000000000003s)]
*  OK, and in that in that situation, you can't really do anything. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2297.76s)]
*  You can't really do anything because not only is he a cis white guy. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2301.6s)]
*  OK, he's like, yeah, sure, he's pro Ukraine. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2305.56s)]
*  OK, insanely pro NATO, very anti China, whatever. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2308.44s)]
*  But like it doesn't comfortably fit any narrative that they want to slot into. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2311.8s)]
*  That's why Sean Hannity just like didn't even talk about his background [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2316.12s)]
*  and immediately start talking about how like immigrants are doing this somehow. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2319.52s)]
*  You know, you're around Trump International Golf Club, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2323.96s)]
*  where the former president was playing around today. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2326.6s)]
*  Here's how the Palm Beach County Sheriff answered that question. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2329.92s)]
*  At this level that he is at right now. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2332.84s)]
*  He's not the city president. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2335.0s)]
*  If he was, we would have had this higher golf course around it. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2336.6s)]
*  Well, because he's not the security is limited to the areas [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2340.0s)]
*  that the Secret Service deems possible. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2342.96s)]
*  So I would imagine that the next time he comes at a golf course, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2345.8s)]
*  there'll probably be a little more people around the perimeter. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2349.6s)]
*  But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2353.08s)]
*  Is there any info about the shooter? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2356.28s)]
*  Go back and watch the VOD for the past like hour and a half. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2357.68s)]
*  We we dove into his background. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2360.6s)]
*  He's nut job like a total nuts out from a chain link fence [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2362.68s)]
*  surrounding the golf club. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2366.68s)]
*  The agent fired off four to six and was just one whole total nut job. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2368.16s)]
*  And also a major libtard like incredibly pro-NATO former Trump voter [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2372.6s)]
*  turned into a never Trump or former Republican [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2378.48s)]
*  who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, became a never Trump Republican [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2381.8799999999997s)]
*  and was a single issue voter. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2385.64s)]
*  He was John Nato backpacks with ceramic plates, essentially [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2387.96s)]
*  the same kind of plates you find in body armor. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2391.08s)]
*  And a GoPro camera was also recovered. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2393.68s)]
*  The suspect was just three to five hundred yards away from the former president. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2396.72s)]
*  The Palm Beach County Sheriff said it's not a long distance when a scope is involved. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2401.24s)]
*  And we just heard Sean say the same thing. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2405.72s)]
*  That suspect has been identified, according to Fox News, as Ryan Wesley Ruth. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2408.0s)]
*  Now, witnesses witnessed saw him fleeing in that Nissan SUV, took a photo. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2413.56s)]
*  Quick action took a photo of the license plate. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2419.28s)]
*  Alerted police. The suspect, Mr. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2422.0400000000004s)]
*  Ruth, was in NABB in nearby Martin County to the north while traveling on I-95. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2424.7200000000003s)]
*  There are those two plates I told you about from the backpacks that were [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2428.92s)]
*  recovered at the scene, and you can see the AK-47 style rifle that was recovered. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2432.32s)]
*  Now, Trump International Golf Club is just a 12 minute drive from nearby [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2437.6400000000003s)]
*  Palm Beach and Mar-a-Lago, of course, where the former president [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2441.76s)]
*  resigns just four and a half miles away. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2444.88s)]
*  It's not clear how this potential was tipped off. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2447.2s)]
*  This was not on any of the former president's schedules. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2450.72s)]
*  Nobody knew he was going to play except for his inner circle. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2455.44s)]
*  Of course, the former president likes to play golf. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2458.0s)]
*  There's no secret there. It's just not clear right now how this [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2460.3599999999997s)]
*  potential was scoping out the former president. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2464.2s)]
*  Did he follow the motorcade out of Mar-a-Lago and then go to the club? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2467.2s)]
*  Or was he already waiting there when the president teed off this afternoon? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2470.56s)]
*  All great questions. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2474.6400000000003s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson giving us a great breakdown of all the information that we have so far [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2475.84s)]
*  as we get ready to continue asking more questions. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2479.76s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson from the White House. Thank you. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2482.4s)]
*  There are questions about security for the former president, of course. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2484.84s)]
*  Questions about how this happened. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2488.36s)]
*  We have former FBI agent and Fox News contributor Nicole Parker joining us now. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2490.0s)]
*  Nicole, thank you for your insights tonight. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2495.0s)]
*  As we've watched all of this unfolding and a lot of the unanswered questions, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2497.88s)]
*  we're looking for information more about this suspect. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2501.6s)]
*  What are your insights? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2504.3999999999996s)]
*  What about what we know and what we can gather from the nest there on? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2506.08s)]
*  Go through the vehicle and the House and seek more information. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2509.12s)]
*  Right. I have a few comments. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2511.9599999999996s)]
*  First of all, I've been watching your programming. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2513.04s)]
*  Sean Hannity is spot on. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2514.68s)]
*  I don't know how many attempts against President Trump is going to take for them [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2516.56s)]
*  to realize he deserves the full amount of security possible. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2520.12s)]
*  No, I don't think they should do that. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2524.9199999999996s)]
*  One, because I think it's so funny. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2527.9599999999996s)]
*  I love that. I love that. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2530.16s)]
*  And I imagine his family, I mean, his loved ones, they have to go through this again. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2532.36s)]
*  And the election, you know, we've got some time to go. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2536.92s)]
*  And he is very much on people's radars. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2539.6s)]
*  And we know this. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2542.16s)]
*  And Christopher Wray has come out and talked about all of these threats. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2543.12s)]
*  Iran has threats against President Trump. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2546.6s)]
*  We have local, you know, officials saying that President Trump is a huge threat to democracy. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2548.64s)]
*  Do you think that is going to embolden individuals to say, you know, I've got to do [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2555.04s)]
*  whatever I have to do to get rid of them? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2558.0s)]
*  That rhetoric has got to end, regardless of where you stand on the political spectrum. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2559.6s)]
*  Violence is not OK. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2563.48s)]
*  And violence against any political individual is not OK. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2564.72s)]
*  Violence against any American is not OK. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2568.36s)]
*  And I think we've almost become numb to it because of many points that Sean Hannity made. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2570.52s)]
*  People pouring across the border. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2575.44s)]
*  I mean, it is extremely dangerous. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2577.04s)]
*  But in light of this specific incident, they mentioned, you know what, he did get more [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2579.44s)]
*  detail as a result of what happened, you know, on July 13th. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2583.44s)]
*  Well, where where was that? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2587.16s)]
*  I live here in South Florida. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2588.96s)]
*  I was an FBI agent at the Miami Division. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2590.32s)]
*  I've been to Palm Beach. I've been to that golf, that golf course and that location where [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2592.6s)]
*  he was. There's a there's a bus stop literally within a couple of hundred feet from that [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2597.84s)]
*  golf course. Any individual can go up to that chain link fence or wherever it might be. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2603.2s)]
*  Hedges are not enough. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2607.84s)]
*  They are not enough. We must honor and respect the Secret Service agent who was able to [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2609.24s)]
*  see that muscle sticking through the fence. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2614.08s)]
*  I mean, that that is that is impressive. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2616.28s)]
*  And again, coming from law enforcement, I can speak from personal experience. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2618.36s)]
*  They changed the deadly force policy for DOJ after the summer of 2020, and it really [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2621.92s)]
*  felt like they were giving less protection to the you know, and specifically for us, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2627.1600000000003s)]
*  the FBI agents. I know that's a similar sentiment likely throughout all of law enforcement, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2631.92s)]
*  where when you are faced with the, you know, a task, a threat, you do start to double [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2636.8s)]
*  and triple guess yourself. Am I authorized to use deadly force? Because now they come [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2642.8s)]
*  after law enforcement. They'll say, you know what, you weren't authorized and now you're [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2647.84s)]
*  going to get charged. We saw that happen quite frequently. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2651.1600000000003s)]
*  They're having dude, this is this is awesome. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2653.84s)]
*  Everyone's got their own pet. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2657.0s)]
*  Everyone's got their own pet project. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2658.84s)]
*  Like, yeah, this is because they're just not like they're mistreating law enforcement [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2661.04s)]
*  officers. You know, you know, the Democrats might approve the additional. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2665.76s)]
*  Oh, they 100% will approve the additional security. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2669.2s)]
*  Are you kidding me? They shouldn't. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2672.44s)]
*  It'd be really funny. It would be really funny if they didn't. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2673.8799999999997s)]
*  But of course, Joe Brandon will do that. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2676.8799999999997s)]
*  Are you kidding me? They literally immediately ran with like, oh, we're so, we're so sad. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2679.04s)]
*  Investigating this as the FBI. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2684.56s)]
*  Is that that seems to me to be a place that you might start to try to get to the bottom of [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2687.0s)]
*  what who did know he was playing today? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2693.08s)]
*  And that's an excellent question. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2695.56s)]
*  And frankly, that's one of the questions I have in listening to all of the reporting as an [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2696.92s)]
*  investigator. I'm sitting here writing my own list of questions, and that is definitely on my [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2700.44s)]
*  list. I want to know, first of all, and I'm just going to kind of run down a few of the [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2704.08s)]
*  questions I have. First of all, is the suspect talking? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2707.6800000000003s)]
*  Is he talking or is he safe, quiet with law enforcement? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2710.56s)]
*  And I want to know what he's saying. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2713.64s)]
*  Was that GoPro active? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2716.0s)]
*  The camera that he had, was that activated or was it not the social media accounts? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2717.48s)]
*  What did he last post? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2722.56s)]
*  What what is his? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2723.92s)]
*  We know we already know dumbass. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2726.08s)]
*  You should have just looked it up. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2727.96s)]
*  Former FBI. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2729.04s)]
*  Is the FBI really hiring dumbasses like this? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2730.76s)]
*  God damn, no wonder they've fallen off. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2733.56s)]
*  Now the digital footprint. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2735.48s)]
*  They used to like infiltrate revolutionary groups and like black leaders and stuff. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2738.1200000000003s)]
*  Now they got this lady over here being like that. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2743.36s)]
*  What was his last text message? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2745.56s)]
*  I want to know. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2748.32s)]
*  God damn, dude. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2749.6s)]
*  Having worked these types of investigations. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2752.0s)]
*  I worked the Caesar Sire type bomb case in the Miami division and we immediately [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2753.96s)]
*  impounded the vehicle. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2758.76s)]
*  It was taken back to the FBI field office in the Miami division and you execute a [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2759.8s)]
*  full search warrant. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2763.76s)]
*  There is not one aspect that goes unnoticed when you're executing those warrants. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2765.2s)]
*  And I trust I know some very amazing FBI agents in the Miami division. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2770.04s)]
*  The SAC for the Miami division mentioned that all resources will be offered. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2775.08s)]
*  The evidence response team and others, they are going to be meticulously [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2779.52s)]
*  conducting this investigation. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2782.84s)]
*  Again, we went through literally every single one of the suspects tweets. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2785.04s)]
*  It was they are hilarious for those of you who are wondering. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2789.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they defunded the FBI, brother. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2794.1600000000003s)]
*  What the hell is this? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2796.76s)]
*  I mean, it's right here. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2798.1200000000003s)]
*  There's I mean, a lot of them got deleted already, I'm pretty sure. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2799.1200000000003s)]
*  But there's really funny. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2802.96s)]
*  They're just really funny overall. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2804.52s)]
*  We need to burn the Kremlin to the ground and put an end to Putin and Russia. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2806.52s)]
*  Let's make Ukraine the whole of Russia in the future. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2810.12s)]
*  World War Three, let's go people. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2813.04s)]
*  I'm ready to fight. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2814.88s)]
*  I'm ready to go to Ukraine and fight or die for the kids and families in Ukraine. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2816.16s)]
*  We cannot sit around and do nothing. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2819.6800000000003s)]
*  We need to flood Ukraine with citizens from around the globe for a massive civilian army. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2821.6800000000003s)]
*  Someone respond to me and let's do this. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2825.64s)]
*  He was a real go getter. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2827.84s)]
*  Hear me out. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2829.52s)]
*  Imagine this guy just wanted to watch Trump play golf, of course, up close, and he [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2830.28s)]
*  didn't own any binoculars. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2834.44s)]
*  So we just had to use the scope on his rifle. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2835.6800000000003s)]
*  Maybe I'm literally Ukrainian. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2837.52s)]
*  And he cares more about Ukraine than me. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2839.72s)]
*  I mean, he was there. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2842.24s)]
*  I you know, what's really funny about it? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2843.64s)]
*  Perhaps because of the fact that he didn't do anything like he couldn't do anything. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2845.64s)]
*  This is not as easy of a case to stick on him as well. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2851.2s)]
*  Like the how are they going to find in? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2855.52s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure this guy is so insane. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2857.9199999999996s)]
*  He probably wrote a manifesto. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2859.68s)]
*  But like, given the way that American laws work, it would be very funny if technically [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2861.3599999999997s)]
*  he didn't do anything illegal because like in the state of Florida, this is a defendable [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2868.32s)]
*  case because in the state of Florida, if he doesn't have like a straight up manifesto, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2874.28s)]
*  OK, in the state of Florida, what was he just had? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2880.1600000000003s)]
*  That's not illegal. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2883.52s)]
*  Like he had on he had, I guess, like, is it public property? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2884.6800000000003s)]
*  No, it's a private property. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2890.0400000000004s)]
*  Like, was he brandishing? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2892.88s)]
*  Because if he wasn't brandishing, like, I don't think it's I don't think it's a it should [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2894.52s)]
*  be, but I don't think it's like to have like a registered firearm, you know, didn't they [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2898.6s)]
*  say they're fired? No, he didn't do anything. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2904.6s)]
*  He didn't fire any. It was Secret Service that no, it's not. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2907.12s)]
*  This is Federal Brother attempted. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2910.12s)]
*  Still counts. Even if he didn't fire. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2911.48s)]
*  I know. I know. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2914.04s)]
*  I'm just saying I'm just thinking like put your defense attorney hat on for a second [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2915.16s)]
*  and think about the ways in which you can get this guy off. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2920.64s)]
*  It's not as crazy as you think, because like they have to prove that he had like an intent [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2923.36s)]
*  like they have to prove that he at least like intended to the president. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2930.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2934.44s)]
*  And a really good I feel like a really good lawyer could potentially be like, no, this [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2935.76s)]
*  guy was just he was just haunting. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2939.84s)]
*  Like, I'm thinking hard about the ways I can get this guy off. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2941.96s)]
*  He who a good Florida defense attorney will get this guy to stay in a luxury mental hospital. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2945.2400000000002s)]
*  Problem is all the good Florida defense attorneys, I think are probably pro Trump, like super [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2950.7200000000003s)]
*  invested in Trump. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2954.96s)]
*  Joma will get this guy off. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2956.52s)]
*  OK, call Joma. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2958.44s)]
*  This is the case of his life. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2961.1200000000003s)]
*  Get him on this immediately. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2963.36s)]
*  I swear to God, dude, get him to pass the bar that easy for him in the state of Florida. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2965.88s)]
*  He would do it and then get Joma on the call, dude. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2970.48s)]
*  Lolo doesn't have a job right now. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2974.6800000000003s)]
*  Lolo passed the bar in Florida. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2976.5600000000004s)]
*  It's probably easier than New York. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2978.8s)]
*  You did it in New York. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2980.44s)]
*  You can definitely do it in Florida. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2981.36s)]
*  They got like way less laws there, I suspect. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2983.48s)]
*  Isn't Amy at the former president intent? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2986.7200000000003s)]
*  Excuse me, Your Honor. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2989.04s)]
*  Who said he was aiming? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2991.04s)]
*  He wasn't even brandishing much to consider. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2993.0s)]
*  Your Honor, my client is a misunderstood man. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2995.6800000000003s)]
*  He simply brought ceramic targets to shoot at and thought that this would be a large [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=2999.6400000000003s)]
*  enough area where he would not be disruptive. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3005.92s)]
*  He's a big fan of nature and thought this big patch of grass would be a perfect place [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3009.1200000000003s)]
*  for him to set down his ceramic targets to shoot at. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3015.04s)]
*  He, as a matter of fact, was really interested in learning how to become a better so he [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3017.88s)]
*  could go back and fight in Ukraine. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3023.2000000000003s)]
*  You are a sellout, Hassan. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3025.44s)]
*  What? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3027.2000000000003s)]
*  You blocking someone known by no one? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3027.6800000000003s)]
*  You are a sellout. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3029.88s)]
*  Filipinos have mine. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3030.84s)]
*  He keeps trying, but he can't avoid me. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3033.2000000000003s)]
*  OK, I'm going to ban this guy. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3035.32s)]
*  I object subjective interpretation, Your Honor. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3036.84s)]
*  Yeah, reduce it down to trespassing and give him house arrest. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3039.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is this is funny. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3042.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3045.0s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3045.88s)]
*  The big weekend show. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3046.8s)]
*  Oh, looking across the golf course at a chain link fence. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3048.76s)]
*  And there are a couple of like we saw with these pictures, a couple of bags, one that [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3053.5200000000004s)]
*  had a GoPro in it. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3057.28s)]
*  And I think one had some ceramic tiles in it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3058.88s)]
*  And he sees a couple of inches of a short barreled AK 47 sticking through the chain [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3061.48s)]
*  link fence and then realizes what it is and then does something about it. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3069.4s)]
*  That's pretty amazing. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3074.72s)]
*  Police work and my goodness, like how fortunate. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3076.64s)]
*  Yeah, we are lucky again. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3080.32s)]
*  There's no denying that. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3081.44s)]
*  And I think to sort of try to advance the story a little bit here early on as we are, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3082.32s)]
*  this is a bureaucratic failure, but an individual success. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3087.6s)]
*  OK, because bureaucratically, there's no way there should have been this kind of a [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3091.92s)]
*  hole in the security around Donald Trump. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3096.3599999999997s)]
*  And, you know, as including Nicole has made the point and many of the other [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3099.08s)]
*  commentators, the protection that you get as a VIP from the Secret Service or from [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3102.96s)]
*  the NYPD here in New York. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3109.12s)]
*  Bro, they did the job. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3110.52s)]
*  Why are they complaining? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3111.8399999999997s)]
*  They did the job and they did it right. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3113.6s)]
*  They well, I mean, they didn't do a super right because they didn't end up like actually [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3116.52s)]
*  shooting the guy. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3120.7599999999998s)]
*  But like they literally did the job. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3121.96s)]
*  They protected him and they're still like they're still mad. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3124.0s)]
*  They're like, oh, no one, no one who doesn't love our big, beautiful boy should be [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3129.04s)]
*  allowed near him. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3134.8799999999997s)]
*  That's the argument you're making at this point. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3136.64s)]
*  It's like there should be a one mile radius around Donald Trump at all times where like [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3138.7599999999998s)]
*  people who are mean to him, who have mean thoughts about him, must immediately get [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3144.72s)]
*  arrested like he ain't Basher Al-Assad, bro. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3149.52s)]
*  This is not happening. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3152.64s)]
*  What are you like? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3153.76s)]
*  What do you expect? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3155.0s)]
*  Beyond my orcas, nobody gets fired. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3156.0s)]
*  And who has firing power? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3159.04s)]
*  The president. Where is our president? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3160.68s)]
*  Yeah, Joe Biden should fire the Secret Service that Trump really likes, by the way. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3163.2s)]
*  On the ground. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3168.0s)]
*  This team today, where they got the picture of the vehicle, they got the vehicle rapidly. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3168.96s)]
*  They communicated amongst themselves and someone was taken into custody fairly swiftly. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3173.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3177.84s)]
*  So the response looks to have been really, really effective. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3178.36s)]
*  It looks like there was good coordination between West Palm and between the Secret Service. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3182.92s)]
*  According to the story that we're getting, it was a witness there who eyeballed him, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3187.96s)]
*  then took photos of the car, took photos of the plate. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3191.52s)]
*  That's the key point right there. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3193.68s)]
*  Thank God for that witness. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3195.12s)]
*  Now, think about what that's like. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3196.4s)]
*  You're in West Palm Beach. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3198.24s)]
*  You're in a patrol car. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3199.32s)]
*  It's a sleepy Sunday. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3200.32s)]
*  You're not expecting much. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3201.32s)]
*  All of a sudden it comes over, force-fired at Donald Trump's golf course. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3202.32s)]
*  You can imagine the adrenaline rush. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3206.1200000000003s)]
*  Everybody goes to the scene and the service is there. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3208.6800000000003s)]
*  You got to protect the, you don't know what's going on. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3211.32s)]
*  And yet it worked. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3213.6800000000003s)]
*  They got the facts fast. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3214.7200000000003s)]
*  They held on to the witness. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3215.84s)]
*  They got the information into the LPR. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3217.32s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3219.6400000000003s)]
*  They did the license plate reader. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3220.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3221.4s)]
*  They were immediately able to track that car. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3222.28s)]
*  They got a hold of the other, the conjoining sheriff's office. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3224.76s)]
*  They immediately got on it. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3228.36s)]
*  They did a car stop. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3229.56s)]
*  They call it a felony stop, right? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3230.48s)]
*  There's certain procedures to make sure there isn't a shootout. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3231.88s)]
*  Turns out it was left at the scene, but they don't know that. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3234.52s)]
*  And it looks like they got the right guy. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3237.12s)]
*  That's pretty seamless. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3239.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3241.0s)]
*  That's, and that happened fast. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3241.4s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3243.04s)]
*  We don't know where this guy resided. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3244.0s)]
*  It looked, there's some indicia that he's not from the area. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3245.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3248.28s)]
*  So we don't know if he was doing pre-surveillance and try to pick up where Trump [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3248.56s)]
*  is on a Sunday, et cetera. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3251.32s)]
*  That's all going to be looked at. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3252.6s)]
*  But you know, at the time they don't know what they're getting into. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3254.08s)]
*  Is the car booby trapped? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3257.28s)]
*  Is there somebody else in the car? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3258.48s)]
*  Does he have bombs? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3259.84s)]
*  Remember the Boston bombing. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3261.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3262.6s)]
*  I had guys up there from NYPD, my guys. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3263.28s)]
*  And you know, those guys were throwing bombs out the back of the truck. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3266.2000000000003s)]
*  So you have no idea what you're getting into with something at this level. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3269.1600000000003s)]
*  So at this point, I think we can say very good response, well coordinated kudos to [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3272.48s)]
*  the team that responded on the ground. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3277.56s)]
*  You got to go back to the prophylactic aspect of this. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3279.96s)]
*  Should it have happened to begin with? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3283.2400000000002s)]
*  Paul, would you recommend if you were handling Donald Trump's security, that [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3285.12s)]
*  he not do outdoor rallies, not golf? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3289.44s)]
*  I don't agree. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3292.8s)]
*  I say that the guy should be able to do what he wants to do. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3293.64s)]
*  He should be able to golf and do outdoor rallies because that's where he gets [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3296.1600000000003s)]
*  to the big crowds. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3298.8s)]
*  But if you were running security, would you say at this point, given two [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3299.84s)]
*  attempts in nine weeks, would you say, you know what, Mr. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3303.4s)]
*  President, let's keep it indoors. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3306.04s)]
*  Let's keep it in a secure location. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3307.88s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3309.6800000000003s)]
*  Look, if that's the safe answer, right? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3310.36s)]
*  I'm running the detail. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3312.48s)]
*  I say that to him and I would fully expect to get a no back. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3313.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3317.64s)]
*  It's safer for me to say, Donald, you know, Mr. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3317.92s)]
*  President, do me a favor. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3320.2000000000003s)]
*  Don't leave the basement. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3321.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3322.12s)]
*  You know, much like the Biden campaign in 2020, right? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3322.52s)]
*  Why don't we take it? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3325.44s)]
*  Let's run a Biden campaign. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3326.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3327.28s)]
*  Can you stay inside Mar-a-Lago so I can sleep at night? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3327.52s)]
*  But I wouldn't expect Donald Trump to adhere to that. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3330.28s)]

*  going to win. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3342.36s)]
*  That's what's driving this. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3343.56s)]
*  I mean, I know, look, you know, it's a little bit of a leap with the [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3344.76s)]
*  motive where it was here. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3346.92s)]
*  But at some point, you know, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3348.08s)]
*  they're afraid he's going to win this two attempts here. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3351.0s)]
*  That's not an accident. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3353.8s)]
*  I'm just curious about what happens tomorrow because after July 13th in [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3355.08s)]
*  Butler, no one from the secret service came to the mics to talk to the American [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3361.4s)]
*  people, to clarify anything. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3365.04s)]
*  So in the void, what did we find? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3366.92s)]
*  Conspiracy theories, lots of questions, all sorts of problems, a [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3369.2000000000003s)]
*  tremendous amount of reporting. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3372.7200000000003s)]
*  But I'm what I'm curious about is if we're going to see the acting director of [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3374.64s)]
*  the secret service tomorrow. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3377.92s)]
*  I know a guy who is some Afghan soldiers that do security. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3381.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3385.56s)]
*  He's a little bit, he's a little bit caught up with some other shit right now. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3385.8s)]
*  But if Trump is real desperate for some extra security, we got just the guy. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3389.48s)]
*  He's got passports. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3394.96s)]
*  He's got passports. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3396.48s)]
*  He's ready to let it rip, dude. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3397.28s)]
*  He's a little tied up currently, but it's pretty funny that the context for this [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3398.6s)]
*  attempt is him golfing like bro's running for president, but just golfs instead of [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3402.72s)]
*  giving up about America's the optics aren't even good for him. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3405.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3408.44s)]
*  But his, his fans love that. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3408.68s)]
*  Thank God for, yeah. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3410.68s)]
*  Thank God there is a, there is a wonderful median American voter out there. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3412.8799999999997s)]
*  Who knows the solution. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3417.96s)]
*  People having mortal fixes. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3419.04s)]
*  I agree. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3420.3199999999997s)]
*  As far as cosmic tortures go, Trump repeatedly experiencing near misses from [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3421.2s)]
*  people he cannot credibly leverage politically is pretty funny. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3424.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3428.44s)]
*  That's actually, that is, that is a very funny. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3429.12s)]
*  That is a very funny monkeys paw situation for him. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3432.36s)]
*  Like that's what I mean. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3437.2000000000003s)]
*  Like he, I bet you, I bet you that in his mind, there was like a brief moment where [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3438.52s)]
*  he was like, Oh my God, I hope it's a Haitian guy or some, why can he not leverage [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3445.1600000000003s)]
*  one politically as opposed to the last one? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3451.1200000000003s)]
*  Um, because despite not being like a registered Republican, he's a former [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3453.32s)]
*  registered Republican, a former Trump supporter, and also seemingly was like, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3458.68s)]
*  Oh, let's be real. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3464.2s)]
*  It's because he's a 58 year old white man. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3464.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3467.52s)]
*  That's, that's the reason why, like that's number one. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3468.4s)]
*  He's a 58 year old cisgender white man. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3471.04s)]
*  It is basically the most protected category. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3474.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3477.12s)]
*  It's not going to, you know, it's going to be really hard. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3477.7999999999997s)]
*  If he was like even a 50 year old black man, you could do that. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3480.3599999999997s)]
*  You could leverage it. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3484.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3485.7599999999998s)]
*  If he was a migrant, Oh my God. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3486.38s)]
*  Oh, that would be perfect for him. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3488.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3490.82s)]
*  Sorry about being white and existing for a duration of time. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3491.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3494.7000000000003s)]
*  As you know, I'm the biggest anti white white man myself. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3494.98s)]
*  So I'm thinking I ever watched a lot of you and I've been watching you do stuff [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3499.1400000000003s)]
*  for years and today, like 10 minutes ago, I just lost a group of friends because [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3502.86s)]
*  they kept repeating Trump's talking points on immigration, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3505.1000000000004s)]
*  So I'm not here to fill the void. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3507.5400000000004s)]
*  I'm sorry to hear about your friends chatter. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3509.7400000000002s)]
*  He's insane though. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3512.86s)]
*  Isn't that leverage enough? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3514.0600000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3515.1400000000003s)]
*  That's the other part. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3516.26s)]
*  He didn't even do this for like abortion. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3517.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3520.5800000000004s)]
*  Like as a white guy, that makes it really hard for him already to like make a [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3521.6200000000003s)]
*  tailor made message around this. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3526.98s)]
*  Cause at most you get like, Oh, your political, your words are making [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3529.34s)]
*  this really hard for us. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3533.94s)]
*  Like you can't ever do that. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3535.2200000000003s)]
*  If you're a Republican, you can never say words or violence because words are [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3536.82s)]
*  literally violence when you're doing it. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3540.7400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3542.42s)]
*  This guy did it for Ukraine. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3542.98s)]
*  Most likely like he did it for NATO. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3544.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3547.14s)]
*  And that in and of itself is not exactly like a massive issue. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3547.7s)]
*  There is bipartisan consensus for the most part with some Republicans saying [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3554.7s)]
*  like we're giving Ukraine too much money, but it's ultimately still foreign policy. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3558.74s)]
*  So that goes, that's relegated to the American bipartisan, American [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3562.1s)]
*  bipartisanship status. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3566.7799999999997s)]
*  So overall, it's not like one of those issues that's like inherently just for [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3568.2599999999998s)]
*  the democratic party. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3572.7799999999997s)]
*  If you, if you pull Democrats and Republicans on like Ukraine, yeah, there's [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3573.74s)]
*  probably a lot more Republicans that want to stop giving the Ukraine or whatever. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3579.7s)]
*  But like, it's not that big of a wedge issue is what I'm trying to say. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3583.9399999999996s)]
*  It's not that big of an issue at all in terms of foreign policy. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3588.74s)]
*  I think like Americans care probably more about, or not even probably. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3591.3799999999997s)]
*  I know that for a fact, Americans care more about than they care about Ukraine, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3595.4599999999996s)]
*  but they don't even care about that much either. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3598.8199999999997s)]
*  So like it still goes back to foreign policy. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3600.7799999999997s)]
*  That's why I used to joke about how like there's not a NATO voter. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3603.5s)]
*  There's not an AUKUS voter. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3606.6600000000003s)]
*  Turns out I was right on that. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3608.38s)]
*  There is one NATO AUKUS voter and his name is Ryan. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3609.5s)]
*  What was it? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3614.94s)]
*  I'm forgetting his name. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3615.42s)]
*  Sorry, Ryan Ruth. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3616.46s)]
*  What did you see? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3617.86s)]
*  This horrendous tweet from Ruth. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3618.5400000000004s)]
*  Oh, that gray streak in your hair is stupid. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3620.26s)]
*  Grow up or go away. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3622.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3623.34s)]
*  I disagree. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3623.5400000000004s)]
*  That's the one thing I disagree with him on. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3624.1000000000004s)]
*  Like that is the only thing that is hot about Tulsi Gabbard is the white streak. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3626.82s)]
*  Everything else sucks. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3631.6200000000003s)]
*  Like I hate Tulsi Gabbard, but I mean the white streak looks sexy. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3632.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean, she's already, yeah, she's attractive, but also like on top of that, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3636.58s)]
*  she's like the white streak makes her look like a, like a comic book super villain. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3639.7s)]
*  They're the ones that should have instituted these changes. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3643.7799999999997s)]
*  Jason, it's Alicia Acuna. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3646.2999999999997s)]
*  Um, this is the American people have been through so much this summer. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3647.8199999999997s)]
*  We've already seen congressional hearings from July 13th. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3651.7799999999997s)]
*  We got some answers, but there are still so many questions and we're supposed to [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3657.14s)]
*  get some more answers and they're not going to be good this coming week. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3660.34s)]
*  You have to assume we're going to have more congressional hearings and we are 50, 51 days. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3663.1000000000004s)]
*  You can tell they got really nothing. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3667.26s)]
*  That's why they keep talking about like Biden wants him to die because he won't [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3669.78s)]
*  give him like more money for his secret service. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3673.3s)]
*  How much you want to bet secret service comes out and says they've already maxed [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3677.1800000000003s)]
*  out, like he gets max defense from secret service more than like any other person [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=3680.26s)]

*  The big story tonight, a second attempt on former president Donald Trump, the [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4044.1s)]

*  I don't know when they're going to do it, but they're going to slot it in again. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4057.14s)]
*  They just had to take it out of the lineup because obviously the entire lineup [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4059.74s)]
*  shifted over to this higher order of priority news story. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4064.26s)]
*  There were two bags, a GoPro and a long over two months ago, the former president [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4068.1800000000003s)]

*  The former president has responded to the shooting, writing there were in my [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4077.0600000000004s)]

*  hear this first. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4085.5400000000004s)]
*  I am safe and well. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4086.86s)]
*  Nothing will slow me down. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4088.6200000000003s)]
*  I will never surrender. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4090.5400000000004s)]
*  Joining us now is Mark Levin, host of Life, Liberty and Levin and former chief [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4092.14s)]
*  of staff to Attorney General Edwin Meese in the Reagan administration. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4096.98s)]
*  Thank you for coming on this evening. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4101.3s)]
*  I just want to start with getting your insights on what has been a truly [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4103.54s)]
*  remarkable day. Well, let's start this way. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4107.1s)]
*  Thank you. Who's in charge? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4109.66s)]
*  Who's in charge? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4112.3s)]
*  We don't have any. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4113.18s)]
*  Master, she's in charge of protecting a presidential candidate in this country. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4115.06s)]
*  Well, we can talk about the Secret Service, the FBI, DHS. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4119.66s)]
*  I'd listen to all your great hosts with their tremendous experience. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4122.9800000000005s)]
*  And it is fascinating to me. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4126.58s)]
*  I'm a little older. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4127.9800000000005s)]
*  I served in the Reagan administration as a chief of staff to Attorney General [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4128.9800000000005s)]
*  Meese. Let me tell you what would have happened in that administration. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4132.34s)]
*  Ronald Reagan would have picked up the phone. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4135.14s)]
*  He would have called Attorney General Meese. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4137.7s)]
*  He would have said, you're in charge of getting to the bottom of this. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4140.06s)]
*  And you've got 48 hours to do it. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4142.26s)]
*  Meese, who I worked next to, he would have called the treasury secretary. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4143.86s)]
*  He would call every department that has any role in federal law enforcement. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4148.98s)]
*  He would have dragged Christopher Wray up there. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4154.82s)]
*  He would have brought in the US Marshals. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4156.5s)]
*  He would have brought them all in secret service. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4158.0599999999995s)]
*  Secretary DHS. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4160.54s)]
*  We would have been in the situation with the United States Department of [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4162.58s)]
*  Justice. And Ed Meese would have said to all those gathered, you better GD get to [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4165.66s)]
*  the bottom of this and you have 48 hours to report to me. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4170.54s)]
*  And I want to know how you're going to fix this. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4174.18s)]
*  And I want to know right away how you're going to fix this. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4176.580000000001s)]
*  Twice on our watch. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4179.540000000001s)]
*  Never. Instead, we have very wise people who've worked at the FBI, worked at [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4180.900000000001s)]
*  secret service, who've worked in local law enforcement. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4186.34s)]
*  Where's the secret service? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4189.1s)]
*  Where's the FBI? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4190.22s)]
*  Nobody is in charge because we have a president of the United States who's [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4191.42s)]
*  mentally incapacitated. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4196.540000000001s)]
*  We have a vice president of the United States who's an incompetent. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4198.38s)]
*  The more the more angry the more he sounds like Master Shane. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4201.34s)]
*  He went the other day about violence and he's what? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4206.34s)]
*  In the witness protection program, the top three people in charge of law [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4210.42s)]
*  enforcement in the United States of America, two of them tweeted, one of them [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4214.820000000001s)]
*  did nothing. Now, this isn't about tweeting. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4218.620000000001s)]
*  I'm so glad that President Trump as well. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4221.820000000001s)]
*  Well, isn't that nice? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4224.26s)]
*  The executive branch is run by the president of the United States. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4225.9400000000005s)]
*  Number two, the vice president of the United States, federal law enforcement, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4230.780000000001s)]
*  ultimately the attorney general of the United States. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4235.38s)]
*  And they're all AWOL. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4238.66s)]
*  They're nowhere. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4241.18s)]
*  So it's perfectly fine if we keep banging heads about the head of the secret [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4242.5s)]
*  service, the head of the FBI. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4247.02s)]
*  These are bureaucrats, mostly. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4248.86s)]
*  Mayorkas, we know what he is. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4251.06s)]
*  He's a complete incompetent buffoon. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4253.42s)]
*  But where the hell is the president, the vice president who wants to be president [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4255.9800000000005s)]
*  and the attorney general who has done absolutely nothing to get his hands [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4260.62s)]
*  around this? Now, I'm telling you this, as somebody who served at the highest [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4265.06s)]
*  level of the Department of Justice, that justice wouldn't sit back and wait for a [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4269.3s)]
*  local special agent in charge in Miami to take over. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4273.3s)]
*  They'd be sending guys in there from Washington, D.C. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4277.9400000000005s)]
*  And Mies would have wanted to report every hour on the damn hour. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4280.9800000000005s)]
*  And he'd want to know what we're going to do to fix this. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4284.9800000000005s)]
*  And I can also tell you that the first time around this would have happened had [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4287.780000000001s)]
*  me been the attorney general reckoned to the president of the United States. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4293.54s)]
*  So this is all evidence to me when I listen to everybody and they're all fantastic. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4296.9s)]
*  But it's all evidence to me of keystone cops. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4302.86s)]
*  Who's in charge or what? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4306.38s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4308.14s)]
*  This one should have done that. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4309.74s)]
*  This should have that. No, we need a general, a general who's in charge and says, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4310.9s)]
*  I want to know who the hell screwed up. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4315.9800000000005s)]
*  I want to know what the hell we're going to do to fix this next time. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4318.9800000000005s)]
*  What resources we need. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4322.0599999999995s)]
*  And I don't want to hear again that the Secret Service doesn't have resources. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4323.34s)]
*  We're five friggin trillion dollars in debt with this administration. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4327.0199999999995s)]
*  Maybe a little bit of that climate change money or money going to illegal aliens. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4330.9s)]
*  Maybe that money could have been moved into the Secret Service. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4335.219999999999s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4337.82s)]
*  But we have no time to figure all that out. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4339.5s)]
*  We have 50 days until a presidential election. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4341.82s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4344.62s)]
*  Does Joe Biden seem not concerned tonight? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4345.86s)]
*  Where is he? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4347.7s)]
*  Does Kamala Harris seem not concerned tonight? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4348.98s)]
*  Well, she tweeted in that nice. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4351.1s)]
*  I tweeted too. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4353.18s)]
*  So what? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4354.14s)]
*  The attorney general United States, does he seem not concerned? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4355.26s)]
*  What is she supposed to do? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4357.860000000001s)]
*  They just don't. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4359.740000000001s)]
*  What is she supposed to do? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4360.820000000001s)]
*  Take up arms against like whoever might Trump nags? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4362.3s)]
*  Like that is what's happening. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4365.46s)]
*  Every part of it, including the best parts of it, the federal law enforcement parts of it. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4367.06s)]
*  They're now running a drift. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4372.780000000001s)]
*  I speak as a former person who served at the highest level of the department of justice. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4374.540000000001s)]
*  So, Mark, Charlie heard here, you know, obviously you're exactly right about President Biden being [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4379.42s)]
*  completely M.I.A. and has been for a long time in the presidency. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4384.62s)]
*  But we're sort of back at this, you know, after the Butler, Pennsylvania shooting, there was all of this [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4389.740000000001s)]
*  this this professed unity where President Biden and others talked about how they were going to lower [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4395.34s)]
*  the rhetoric. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4401.38s)]
*  But now we're back to where you have Democrats issuing tweets saying that they're that they're glad [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4402.46s)]
*  that the guy they called last week, Hitler, survived another attempt. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4409.660000000001s)]
*  Is it strikes me that maybe they didn't really mean it when they said it six weeks ago. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4414.1s)]
*  You know, if you watch MSNBC for about 15 minutes, the hate and the drivel and the contempt that pours [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4420.860000000001s)]
*  from Joy Reid and I mean, don't get me started with a long list. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4428.86s)]
*  CNN, so contemptible every time they mention Trump's name, they have this constipated look on their [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4433.099999999999s)]
*  face like it's very it's unbearable. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4438.299999999999s)]
*  The way that you have prosecutors talk about Donald Trump, elected prosecutors and a Garland [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4441.74s)]
*  appointed prosecutor, the things that they say in the briefs are so horrendous. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4448.78s)]
*  What some of these judges have to say, the Democrat Party controls the culture. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4453.179999999999s)]
*  They control the media. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4457.419999999999s)]
*  They control the propaganda. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4458.94s)]
*  They now control many of the court systems. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4460.78s)]
*  And that's exactly what you're seeing. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4463.339999999999s)]
*  You're seeing a one party monopolistic system. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4465.259999999999s)]
*  And people have written about this long before me who've gone through these various regimes, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4468.379999999999s)]
*  totalitarian regimes, their use of words, creating devil terms and angel terms, you know, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4473.5s)]
*  Trump always the devil, the hierarchy, the angel. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4479.74s)]
*  And you can see this endless propaganda and contempt. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4482.7s)]
*  And by the way, they hate you and me too. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4485.98s)]
*  They've made it abundantly clear they hate at least half the country. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4489.0199999999995s)]
*  So of course this contributes to the nut jobs out there and so forth. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4492.219999999999s)]
*  But still, I don't know how much we can do to fix that. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4496.0599999999995s)]
*  I do know we can do something to fix the executive branch. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4499.66s)]
*  We got to boot these people out as fast as possible, take these agencies back. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4503.0199999999995s)]
*  We need to fumigate them. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4507.179999999999s)]
*  We need to get people in there who are serious public servants and civil servants. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4508.459999999999s)]
*  We need to put competent people in senior positions. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4512.219999999999s)]
*  We need to take the FBI back. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4515.02s)]
*  We need to take all these federal agencies and particularly the police agencies back. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4516.700000000001s)]
*  We need to take the Department of Justice back. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4521.740000000001s)]
*  And we can do that in the next election because right now they're completely and utterly either [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4524.14s)]
*  out of control or rudderless. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4529.820000000001s)]
*  Mark, it's Joe Concha. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4532.38s)]
*  I'm going to read a quote from Lester Holt who was reporting on this attempt again, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4533.580000000001s)]
*  the second in 64 days. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4538.780000000001s)]
*  Here's what he said tonight on the NBC Nightly News. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4540.9400000000005s)]
*  And you're going to get a real kick out of this quote. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4543.9s)]
*  Today's apparent attempt comes amid increasingly fierce rhetoric on the campaign trail. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4546.379999999999s)]
*  Mr. Trump, his running mate, JD Vance, continued to make baseless claims about Haitian immigrants [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4551.5s)]
*  in Springfield, Ohio, resulting in threats. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4557.0199999999995s)]
*  So in other words, it's Trump's fault that somebody tried to shoot him today because of [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4560.219999999999s)]
*  something that was said about Springfield, Ohio, which has had an influx of thousands [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4565.259999999999s)]
*  upon thousands of Haitian immigrants to their town. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4569.82s)]
*  And because Trump brings that up and because JD Vance brings that up, therefore, that's [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4572.54s)]
*  what's leading this. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4575.98s)]
*  I'll let you go from here because I can't believe what I just saw right now on the NBC [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4577.1s)]
*  Nightly News. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4581.42s)]
*  Sickness. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4581.98s)]
*  Absolutely sickness. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4583.5s)]
*  No, actually, I thought it was all the Democrats and their anti-Semitism. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4584.78s)]
*  I thought it was all the Democrats and their anti-Israel. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4588.06s)]
*  I thought it was all the Democrats hunting down Jews on universities and college campuses. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4591.1s)]
*  I thought they were the problem. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4595.98s)]
*  I thought it was all the illegal immigrants raping, selling into slavery, women and children. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4597.5s)]
*  Maybe Lester Holt, maybe Lester Holt has a difficulty digesting facts around this guy [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4603.02s)]
*  is not a Haitian. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4608.86s)]
*  In fact, the more I'm reading is I'm getting information. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4610.62s)]
*  He may have been an anti-Semite. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4613.02s)]
*  I don't know what he is. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4614.46s)]
*  We'll get the fact. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4615.18s)]
*  The Lester Holt didn't have any facts. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4616.46s)]
*  Bro said one time the Gaza has to stop and they're immediately like, he's an anti-Semite. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4618.3s)]
*  Computer would melt down. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4626.14s)]
*  Everyone knows. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4627.26s)]
*  In order to try and turn look, let's be honest. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4629.18s)]
*  They've been trying to turn Trump into a non-human and that's what they've been trying to do from [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4632.46s)]
*  the beginning. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4636.86s)]
*  They're dehumanizing him and they've been doing this. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4637.42s)]
*  I've written about this in two books. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4640.54s)]
*  Dude, what are you saying, dude? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4643.18s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4645.1s)]
*  The Democrats are pussies. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4646.94s)]
*  But like, of course, despite being pussies, they're still running a campaign against [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4649.18s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4653.1s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4654.54s)]
*  Every now and then they will actively be like Trump is bad for America. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4655.74s)]
*  As you're supposed to. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4661.5s)]
*  These guys are so used to bullying the liberals that they straight up are like, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4663.26s)]
*  if you're running against the Republican after he got that, you're a bad person. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4669.0199999999995s)]
*  You should just let him win. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4674.38s)]
*  It's like, are you insane? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4675.82s)]
*  Like, what is this argument? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4677.5s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4679.9s)]
*  Oh, where's the humanity? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4681.18s)]
*  Yeah, dude, they're running a campaign. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4683.18s)]
*  It's insane, dude. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4685.66s)]
*  Mark, it's Alicia Acuna and thank you so much for being here. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4688.54s)]
*  You know, as you know, the acting US Secret Service Director, Ronald Rowe, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4691.66s)]
*  gave an update to senators on Thursday on the internal investigation from the July 13th [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4694.94s)]

*  Okay. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4712.22s)]
*  Who stole the election are dehumanizing our president instead of just saying, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4712.62s)]
*  sorry, you win this round, sir. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4718.62s)]

*  But Paul, I want to go to you, actually, if we can, just to continue this conversation. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4816.3s)]
*  Some of the points that Mark Levin was making, he just really hammered on this idea of leadership [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4821.0199999999995s)]
*  because Americans want leadership right now and they're not seeing it. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4825.9s)]
*  It begs, it beggars belief that we still have not gotten a press conference from [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4830.3s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas relative to the failures of the Secret Service. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4835.1s)]
*  What we should have gotten is, first of all, Mayorkas very early in the game after Butler. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4838.3s)]
*  But then subsequent to that, there should have been a press conference about how the service [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4843.0199999999995s)]
*  under him is being rebuilt and the measures that were taken to fix what was clearly a flaw. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4848.14s)]

*  They're on the cutting room floor. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4860.620000000001s)]
*  Nobody seems to care. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4861.660000000001s)]
*  And think about the signal it sends to our adversaries. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4862.620000000001s)]
*  If we could get two apparent clowns who are low level to manage to almost do what they [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4866.3s)]
*  almost did here, not only in Butler, but down in Florida, what does it say to the IRGC in Iran? [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4872.22s)]
*  What does it say to some of our more radicalized enemies around the world? [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4879.26s)]
*  What it says is America is not what they used to be. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4883.58s)]
*  We don't have to worry about these guys. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4886.38s)]
*  They don't even seem to be able to protect one of their main VIPs who may very well be [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4887.98s)]
*  the next president. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4892.7s)]
*  It is a diminution of American stature, American status, and the fact that we can't do this. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4893.98s)]
*  If you're sitting where, let's say, the Chinese or the Russians are, you've got to say, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4901.74s)]
*  we don't have to worry about these guys. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4904.38s)]
*  Would you be worried, Paul, to my point earlier, and I asked Mark this, I asked Jason this as well, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4906.62s)]
*  that a 20 year old outflanked the entire Secret Service. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4912.54s)]
*  Bro had to wave in, weave in, and IRGC mentioned, yeah, they love Iran. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4916.06s)]
*  So did he take that or not? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4920.78s)]
*  Because they're acting like the crank emptied the clip. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4921.66s)]
*  No, dude, they did not. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4923.9s)]
*  They're just, they are trying to massage the narrative to a way, into a situation where [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4925.5s)]
*  it kind of feels like there was a real threat against Donald Trump. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4932.06s)]
*  And this time there obviously wasn't, unlike the last time. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4936.14s)]
*  He didn't even get it off. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4940.14s)]
*  He didn't even get it off, dude. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4941.34s)]
*  Yeah. He got at by Secret Service. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4942.9400000000005s)]
*  He ran away, would be shooter arrested. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4945.42s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, even in the chirocter, it says would be shooter arrested, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4948.3s)]
*  GoPro and found outside of Trump International Golf Club. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4951.58s)]
*  To be fair, it's still an attempt. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4953.9800000000005s)]
*  I know, but they're lying about the, they're lying about the events that took place [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4955.66s)]
*  because no one was fired in his vicinity. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4962.3s)]
*  They're making it seem like this guy literally grazed Trump again, when obviously he did it. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4965.34s)]
*  And that's the funny part about this because they also then have to complain about something. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4970.7s)]
*  And they're basically like, oh, well, what about the Secret Service? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4976.3s)]
*  Like they didn't do a good job. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4979.34s)]
*  It's like, what do you mean? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4980.38s)]
*  They literally foiled an attempt. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4981.099999999999s)]
*  What the f*** do you want them to do? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4983.179999999999s)]
*  And therein lies the problem. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4984.46s)]
*  You can't cut a narrative off of this when the actual, when the actual things that happened [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4986.78s)]
*  are not even as like eye catching as the last time this occurred. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=4995.9s)]
*  And the last time this occurred, nobody gave it. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5000.54s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5006.14s)]
*  So like, it's funny to me that they are doing, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5007.42s)]
*  it's funny to me that they're doing the exact same thing again. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5010.7s)]
*  I tweeted, loved it. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5013.9s)]
*  The last time Trump almost got the GOP message was these monstrous Dems who export illegals [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5015.42s)]
*  from the third world to rape your kids. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5019.42s)]
*  Still are campaigning against our president with mean words. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5021.66s)]
*  And it didn't move the needle even a little bit. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5024.46s)]
*  And they're doing it again. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5026.86s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5028.22s)]
*  It didn't work the last time and Trump almost got man. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5029.42s)]
*  They hate him. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5032.3s)]
*  We hate him. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5033.66s)]
*  I hate him. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5034.54s)]
*  I'm a Joe Brandon voter. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5035.66s)]
*  I'm writing in for Biden. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5036.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm writing in Biden. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5038.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5039.18s)]
*  And I still hate Donald Trump. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5039.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5041.74s)]
*  I hate them. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5042.38s)]
*  Of course I hate them. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5043.1s)]
*  Look at him, dude. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5043.9800000000005s)]
*  Look at the past week of stories. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5044.78s)]
*  Damn. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5047.9s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5048.38s)]

*  Ruth is currently posting on Facebook about getting Afghanistan citizens into the international [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5060.14s)]
*  legion. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5064.22s)]

*  He has no authority to act on behalf of Ukraine. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5073.66s)]
*  It ignores laws about visas. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5075.42s)]
*  Ruth is either human trafficking, scamming people or attempting to break as many countries [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5077.26s)]
*  laws as he can to try to smuggle people to the Ukraine to fight. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5081.26s)]
*  This is unethical, unprofessional and unacceptable. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5083.82s)]
*  This was back in 2024 in June, I think. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5086.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5089.900000000001s)]

*  I served in international legion for two years and I've told Ruth many times since 2022 that [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5102.22s)]
*  he's not helping and what he's going and what he's doing is illegally. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5106.22s)]

*  It's remarkable how disparate the media footprints of the Butler shooter versus Ruth were. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5124.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnaT6mL2i0&t=5128.54s)]
