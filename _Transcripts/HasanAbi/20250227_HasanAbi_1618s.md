# The Truth Behind Israel Rejects Long-term Ceasefire Efforts | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74)
*  Israel, when she was released, lied about her conditions and said Hamas actually broke her arm. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=0.0s)]
*  She openly stated that the Israeli government was lying about what had taken place. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=6.0s)]
*  That her biggest fear, when she was held captive, was actually Israeli [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=13.0s)]
*  that killed one of the hostages that she was with. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=18.0s)]
*  What the f*** are you talking about? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=21.0s)]
*  There has never been a moment where I have supported the number one baby s*** since the Rwandan s*** side, which is Israel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=22.0s)]
*  What the f*** are you saying? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=29.0s)]
*  Wake up, man! Wake up! Jesus Christ! Holy shit! [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm talking about Hamas parading around dead babies. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=38.0s)]
*  I'm talking about Hamas parading around dead babies. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=41.0s)]
*  Wake up, man! Wake up! Jesus Christ! Holy shit! [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=45.0s)]
*  I'm talking about Hamas parading around dead babies. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=49.0s)]
*  I'm so awake. I'm just not woke. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=51.0s)]
*  Hamas parading around dead babies is also a ridiculous... [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=53.0s)]
*  They did a funeral procession. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=57.0s)]
*  That's what they did. That's what you're calling parading dead children. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=60.0s)]
*  And they said that it was Israel that killed those children. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=64.0s)]
*  And guess what? The Bebas family also does not appreciate that Benjamin Netanyahu is parading the Bebas family, the children that were slain, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=69.0s)]
*  without giving the Bebas family the actual autopsy report. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=78.0s)]
*  What is more likely that this family actually was slaughtered privately and quietly in the hands of Hamas, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=83.0s)]
*  or Israel accidentally killed them as they have done and is lying about it? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=91.0s)]
*  We don't know. We don't have evidence. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=95.0s)]
*  The only evidence, quote unquote, that we have is the nation state that has literally done a j***** right, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=97.0s)]
*  also simultaneously has routinely lied about the hostages that they've done. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=104.0s)]
*  Only after numerous lawsuits have they had to reveal the true autopsy reports in the past for other Israeli hostages. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=108.0s)]
*  Okay? I mean, strangled and their skulls crushed. Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=118.0s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu literally, instead of giving the autopsy report to the family, turned around and paraded the autopsy report, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=123.0s)]
*  which we, which I doubt the veracity of at this stage, 100%. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=132.0s)]
*  Okay. The Israeli government has used AI imagery to, you know, talk about the children that died. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=136.0s)]
*  Okay. And you're over here. You're over here talking about how, you know, I know for a fact Hamas actually strangled them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=144.0s)]
*  Yeah, here it is. The Bevis family has threatened to sue the Israeli government for exploiting the deaths of their family members [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=152.0s)]
*  for propaganda purposes as layers of evidence support claims and Israeli airstrike killed them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=157.0s)]
*  And you're over here using dead children. Once again, this time, dead Israeli children, which by your estimation, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=162.0s)]
*  I suspect has a higher value than dead Palestinian children. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=169.0s)]
*  After all, you literally do not even recognize that Israel has killed more children in Israel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=173.0s)]
*  And you're over here using the information in any global conflict that since the Rwandan j***** died. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=181.0s)]
*  Okay. And that is not even a thing in your mind. That doesn't even matter in your mind. It's just pure propaganda. That's it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=187.0s)]
*  Here it is. Bevis family tells Netanyahu to shut up as he details the murders of Shiri, Ariel and Kefir. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=196.0s)]
*  Publishing unapproved information is abuse for its own sake, says Ofri Bebas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=201.0s)]
*  And this also blows up buildings where hostages are without any care for their well-being. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=236.0s)]
*  This if you were in any way, shape or form remotely interested in learning about the truth. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=243.0s)]
*  Okay. Or even a little bit knowledgeable. If you read any Israeli media in general, okay, you would know, bro. Stop. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=251.0s)]
*  You're speaking bullshit. Okay, dude. I know. I know it feels bad. I know. I get it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=259.0s)]
*  I get it. It feels bad for you. Okay. It feels bad to hear the truth after you have been conditioned to believe something else here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=264.0s)]
*  Here's the Bevis family from three days ago. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=274.0s)]
*  We appeal to a number of authorities, including Prime Minister's office and the information system to make it clear that the decision to publish any details about the gruesome murders is solely the decision of the family and no pressure be put on it to exploit the murder for alleged public purposes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=277.0s)]
*  Our request is also addressed to the entire public. Please do not participate or share in the race to publish difficult offensive and private details. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=288.0s)]
*  Even in these painful times, the Bevis family and an entire nation are mourning the murder of their family members. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=295.0s)]
*  And while the family is busy preparing for the funeral and burial of their deceased loved ones, and before the report from the Institute of Forensic Medicine was received, the family surprisingly continues to receive repeated requests from domestic political parties, media parties and private parties for needs that are assumed to be explanatory. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=300.0s)]
*  Or with the aim of satisfying the public voyeurism and mainly publishing the details of the murders. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=317.0s)]
*  All this despite the family's request to avoid harming her privacy and dignity. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=322.0s)]
*  If you knew anything about this process and the conditions that these hostages were put through, Israeli hostages were put through, even Noah Argimani recently testified. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=327.0s)]
*  Noah Argimani is by no means pro-Hamas, okay, or by no means pro-Palestinian. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=337.0s)]
*  She is an Israeli occupying force soldier who was captured by the militant resistance groups on October 7. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=343.0s)]
*  She was held captive. Israel propagandized her all the time. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=353.0s)]
*  Israel, when she was released, lied about her conditions and said Hamas actually broke her arm. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=357.0s)]
*  She openly stated that the Israeli government was lying about what had taken place. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=363.0s)]
*  That her biggest fear when she was held captive was actually Israeli b****s that killed one of the hostages that she was with. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=370.0s)]
*  You would know that if you just got your f****** news from any outlet that actually cares about the truth. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=379.0s)]
*  But you don't care about the truth, okay? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=386.0s)]
*  You just care about s****** startopathic drama loving weirdo. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=389.0s)]
*  I know Noah Argimani was at Nova, not active military. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=393.0s)]
*  Wait, no, she is. No, she was. I thought she was IDF as well, regardless of being at Nova. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=396.0s)]
*  She was captured at Nova. Now, I don't think this family thinks an Israeli airstrike killed the children, at least not based on the statement alone. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=404.0s)]
*  No, the family, I don't know what the family's opinion is beyond what they have told so far. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=410.0s)]
*  And what they've told is they do not have access to the forensic investigation. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=417.0s)]
*  Okay, that's number one. Number two, number two, families have actually sued the Israeli government. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=421.0s)]
*  Families of slain IDF hostages, okay, have successfully sued the Israeli government since October 7. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=428.0s)]
*  Because the Israeli government has lied about how these how these hostages have died. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=438.0s)]
*  Okay, I need you to understand this. Please. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=445.0s)]
*  If your immediate family members are killed, you would probably care about the truth more than doing propaganda. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=449.0s)]
*  Okay, that is what these victims want. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=457.0s)]
*  And that is the most understandable demand of all time. It's crazy. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=461.0s)]
*  Yeah, speaking of Noah's survivors, they also sued the Israeli government for deliberately putting them in harm's way as well, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=465.0s)]
*  allowing there to be a rave next to a concentration camp when all evidence suggested that that concentration camp was slated to break out at any given moment. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=471.0s)]
*  And they refused to listen to any prior warning from the Egyptian government and prior warnings from Unit 8200, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=480.0s)]
*  which is the surveillance unit at the Gaza envelope that surveils Palestinian activity. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=487.0s)]
*  But of course, you don't care about any of this stuff, but it's fine. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=492.0s)]
*  I will sometimes respond to trolls before you chatters get mad. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=495.0s)]
*  Okay, before before chatters get mad and say, Hassan, why are responding trolls? Because this is informational. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=500.0s)]
*  Okay, this is a moment for a lot of people to learn the truth. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=506.0s)]
*  It's not going to be the troll himself that actually goes, you know what happens because they're not in here. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=511.0s)]
*  They're not in here to actually understand what truly is happening. They're in here to just shit stir. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=517.0s)]
*  Okay, but it's a good it's a good moment for education. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=523.0s)]
*  French MEP barred from Israel says Bevis family wasn't murdered justifies Hamas attack the Bevis family itself asked the Israeli authorities to stop commenting on the circumstances of the death of their loved ones. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=528.0s)]
*  She said, arguing that they have not received official or any clear information on the reports communicated by the Israeli army. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=538.0s)]
*  This is a twisting of the Bevis family's comments. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=542.0s)]
*  The family is acknowledged that the autopsy shows that Shiri Ariel Kiefer Bevis were murdered and is asked that no more details be given to the media for privacy reasons in expressing anger that more explicit details of the deaths have leaked. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=544.0s)]
*  They have noted that they have not yet been given the full details themselves at no point have they questioned the forensic experts assertions that the three were murdered by their guards. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=554.0s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, the Bevis family itself also believe that the that their family members were murdered by the guards. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=562.0s)]
*  Okay, this still doesn't change anything in terms of having an independent forensic expert actually literally look at these autopsy reports. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=569.0s)]
*  If they want justice to be served, and if they actually want to know the truth, they can demand for it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=583.0s)]
*  If they don't demand for it, that's fine. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=589.0s)]
*  Is it likely that this will happen? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=592.0s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=594.0s)]
*  But what is the reason for my assertion that Israel might be wrong about this or might be deliberately misinforming the public about this? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=595.0s)]
*  Number one, there is a second phase of the ceasefire negotiation that Israel does not want to follow through on because this phase of the negotiation, the ceasefire would make the ceasefire permanent, would move in the direction of permanent ceasefire, a permanent cessation of hostilities. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=605.0s)]
*  Number two, Israel has routinely lied about every detail, every step of the way since October 7, but certainly before October 7 as well. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=625.0s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it's easier to figure out the times when Israel hasn't lied about an issue. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=636.0s)]
*  Okay, it always happens in the same exact way. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=642.0s)]
*  Israel doesn't even talk about many of the death and destruction that they cause until it becomes a newsworthy story in the West, like the World Central Kitchen aid workers. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=646.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=658.0s)]
*  And their first response is always immediately to lie immediately. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=659.0s)]
*  They get disproven time and time again. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=663.0s)]
*  Sometimes if there are actual Israeli citizens that are victims to these lies, they have the capacity to sue the Israeli government. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=665.0s)]
*  And then the truth is uncovered. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=673.0s)]
*  The greatest example I can give you is quite literally the Israeli IDF hostage that was killed whose mother demanded the truth from the Israeli government. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=675.0s)]
*  The Israeli government said Hamas killed the hostage. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=686.0s)]
*  Of course they did. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=689.0s)]
*  They did. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=690.0s)]
*  They were like, oh no, Hamas killed the hostage. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=691.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=692.0s)]
*  But the mother said that the asphyxiation was most likely caused by the bombing. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=693.0s)]
*  And she successfully she kept suing the government. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=699.0s)]
*  And lo and behold, Israel quietly admitted that that Israeli occupying force hostage was actually killed because of Israeli bombing campaigns. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=702.0s)]
*  Other hostages have talked about hostages that have died due to Israeli bombing campaigns. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=711.0s)]
*  Hostages have talked about how their greatest fear was their own government blowing them up. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=717.0s)]
*  And we're still having this conversation. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=722.0s)]
*  We're still having this back and forth. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=724.0s)]
*  It blows my mind. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=726.0s)]
*  But this isn't the only reason why I think that the claims being made by the Israeli government might not be true. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=727.0s)]
*  The other reasons why I think the claims being made by the Israeli government might not be true is because I don't believe that Hamas militants are the most moral people on the planet and are operating on this like unimaginable morality. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=734.0s)]
*  Although Palestinian emancipation is the moral cause, individual actors are not always going to behave in this most moral fashion. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=749.0s)]
*  That's not my argument at all. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=756.0s)]
*  But they do still follow normal logic. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=758.0s)]
*  OK, they did not capture Israeli civilians and Israeli occupying force soldiers alike simply to go and kill them quietly. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=762.0s)]
*  This is why since October 7, I've said over and over again. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=774.0s)]
*  This is why I've said since October 7 over and over again that there is a reason for why they did this. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=777.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you don't agree with the tactics or not. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=782.0s)]
*  That's not what I'm talking about. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=785.0s)]
*  OK, the reason was obvious. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=787.0s)]
*  It was leverage. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=790.0s)]
*  They had demands. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=791.0s)]
*  They're an entirely captive population who that that understandably felt like they had no other option but to fight back to escape the conditions that they were in. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=793.0s)]
*  They were forced into experiencing by the Israeli state that doesn't see them as human. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=804.0s)]
*  OK, and in that process, I kept repeating over and over again, if Hamas or any members of the Palestinian militancy kill any of the hostages, they will tell you. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=810.0s)]
*  And they did. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=822.0s)]
*  There was an instance where a Palestinian guard actually engaged in a revenge killing of a hostage. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=823.0s)]
*  Hamas revealed that information that did happen. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=830.0s)]
*  There was also there's also the other part of this process. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=833.0s)]
*  Hamas also killed hostages when Israel during a ceasefire negotiation process decided to militarily go and extract some hostages. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=837.0s)]
*  OK, and in the process they did. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=845.0s)]
*  They they killed I think four hostages. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=847.0s)]
*  They openly revealed this information as well. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=850.0s)]
*  But not only that, but also the Bevis family was slain in November of 2023. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=852.0s)]
*  OK, November 20, 23. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=860.0s)]
*  And when they were killed in the process, and I believe that it was initially not even in that they weren't captured by the Al Qassam brigades. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=863.0s)]
*  I believe that they were captured by some random group and they had a hard time. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=872.0s)]
*  They had a hard time, obviously, under the the bombing campaign that was happening, figuring out where every single hostage was and take accountability. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=877.0s)]
*  OK, take an account of where all the hostages are. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=887.0s)]
*  But as far as I yeah, it was the Mujahideen movement. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=891.0s)]
*  Yes. Thank you, Murat Butler. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=894.0s)]
*  That initially took the Bevis family hostage, the Mujahideen brigade in November, 2023. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=896.0s)]
*  Hamas revealed that the Bevis family had been slain in an Israeli bombing campaign. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=905.0s)]
*  They also said that they would voluntarily send the bodies back to Israel. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=911.0s)]
*  In November, 2023. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=918.0s)]
*  In November, 2023. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=923.0s)]
*  OK, Israel said Hamas was playing politics. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=927.0s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=930.0s)]
*  I feel like that context is never really mentioned in this process. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=931.0s)]
*  Why didn't they return the bodies? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=936.0s)]
*  Israel refused. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=938.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=939.0s)]
*  When people fall for such sloppy propaganda, you know, the illiteracy rate is abysmal. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=940.0s)]
*  So there is a massive onslaught of Israeli propaganda that the Israeli Knesset has spent two hundred and fifty million dollars on this year. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=944.0s)]
*  We know that Israel is not shy about lying about the details of things that have happened. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=956.0s)]
*  So excuse me for being a little critical about the initial statements that come from Israel, especially when they have shown over and over again that they do not actually give a shit about Israeli citizens. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=963.0s)]
*  Here's another point of Israeli propaganda or Israel, the Israeli government lying and then turning around and openly admitting that they did something. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=976.0s)]
*  The Israeli military directive, the Israeli military has a protocol called the Hannibal Directive. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=986.0s)]
*  OK, the Hannibal Directive directs the soldiers to shoot and kill Israeli civilians or Israeli soldiers if they are in the process of being captured by Palestinian militants. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=993.0s)]
*  Because in the eyes of the Israeli government, those people are better dead than alive, because when they're alive, their immediate family members are going to create a lot of pressure on the Israeli government. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1007.0s)]
*  And initially, on October 7, there were Israeli civilians that were in some of these little villages that stated that the Israeli government had actually opened fire on those villages and most likely killed some of the side of the Kibbutzim. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1022.0s)]
*  Well, we don't need to speculate about it any longer because the defense minister, the former defense minister who was the defense minister during October 7 actually openly admitted to utilizing the Hannibal Directive on October 7. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1041.0s)]
*  A couple of weeks ago, IDF carried out Hannibal Directive, new sort of Damocles operation on October 7. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1057.0s)]
*  All means are kosher. Look at the IDF's controversial Hannibal Directive explainer. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1064.0s)]
*  The Air Force was carrying out the sport of Damocles operation, a code name only being revealed on Thursday for the first time to attack many Hamas commanders in their headquarters around 1030 a.m. October 7, 2023, just as it was carrying out the Hannibal Directive of gunning down anything that moved around the Israel Gaza Porter. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1068.0s)]
*  This is from the Jerusalem Post. This is an outlet that is an ultra Zionist outlet. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1083.0s)]
*  The Jerusalem Post is famous for writing articles such as, well, Southern Southern Lebanon, more like Northern Israel. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1088.0s)]
*  Just so you understand, this ain't, you know, the woke lords over at Haaretz. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1097.0s)]
*  This is the fucking Jerusalem Post. The Air Force has been questioned about if the forces invested in attacking Hamas commanders deep in Gaza would have been better used to defend the Gaza border and to attack Hamas invaders in Israeli villages. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1103.0s)]
*  And yes, it was reported at the time that Hamas had offered to hand over remains of the hostage baby and family. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1118.0s)]
*  Okay, look, this was written about my what? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1126.0s)]
*  One 12, 20, 23, oh, 12 December 1st, 2023. God damn it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1131.0s)]
*  Frickin Frenchman Hamas on Friday said it offered to hand over the bodies of a mother and her two sons, one of them a baby in talks to extend a now expired truth. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1138.0s)]
*  Shari Bebas, her 10 month old son, Kfir and his four year old brother Ariel, along with her father, Yarden, have become emblematic of the October 7 attacks due to the age of the baby Kfir. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1146.0s)]
*  Earlier this week, Hamas are armed wing announced that Shari Kfir and Ariel had been killed in an Israeli bombing before the now lapsed truce went into effect. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1155.0s)]
*  A claim Israel's military has said it's investigating but has yet to confirm combat between Israel and Hamas resumed the Gaza Strip Friday morning after an agreement could not be reached on the prolonging seven day pause in fighting under the terms of the temporary truth. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1163.0s)]
*  Hamas have returned scores of Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of more than 200 Palestinian prisoners throughout the night. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1174.0s)]
*  Indirect negotiations unfolded to extend the truth, the Palestinian militant group said in a statement on Friday. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1179.0s)]
*  Hamas also offered to transfer the Bebas family bodies and release their father along for their burial, along with two Zionist detainees, it added. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1184.0s)]
*  Israeli authorities remained unresponsive, it said. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1191.0s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister's Office meanwhile told the AFP Israel will not address propaganda based reports coming from Hamas. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1195.0s)]
*  As of Thursday, reports of the deaths of the three Bebas family members remain unconfirmed, according to the army spokesman Daniel Hagari. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1201.0s)]
*  The army has previously said Hamas is wholly responsible for the security of all hostages. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1208.0s)]
*  That we are literally bombing. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1212.0s)]
*  We're bombing the hostages. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1214.0s)]
*  The father did survive, yes. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1216.0s)]
*  Government spokesman Aylin Levy, because the father was separated from the mother and the children. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1218.0s)]
*  Obviously you can't separate the children from the mother, but the father was separated. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1223.0s)]
*  Government spokesman Aylin Levy, former government spokesman, on Friday blamed Hamas for the collapse of the truth, accusing it of having to, having failed to provide a list of more hostages for release. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1227.0s)]
*  He said Hamas was still holding 137 hostages taken on October 7, including the Bebas family. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1236.0s)]
*  The family were among the roughly 240 hostages dragged back to Gaza after Milton streamed into Israel and an attack that left 1200 people dead. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1240.0s)]
*  Most of them civilians, according to Israeli officials. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1247.0s)]
*  Israel's ensuing war, and this was literally in December of 2023, has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to Hamas, around government in Gaza. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1250.0s)]
*  These are the reasons as to why I am critical of the Israeli government's propaganda on this. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1258.0s)]
*  And I am suspicious because I recognize Israel's motivations. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1266.0s)]
*  I also recognize that Israel has time and time again lied about how hostages have been killed. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1272.0s)]
*  You are lying. You can't wait. What? Yeah. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1280.0s)]
*  I wonder if young herpes has a response to any of this shit. Probably not. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1284.0s)]
*  It's really hard to learn the fucking truth and to question authority. I know I get it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1289.0s)]
*  It's much easier for you to look at these ongoing atrocities and basically talk about it from the perspective of drama between content creators. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1304.0s)]
*  Okay. They're probably being sarcastic. No young herpes was not being sarcastic. He was just saying some dumb shit. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1316.0s)]
*  He probably got banned. Yeah. Lake Mcgroove banned them here. We'll unban them and we'll hear what he has to say. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1323.0s)]
*  Now, I think I've had a fairly moderate perspective, which is why it's also funny when people yell at me about this shit. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1329.0s)]
*  Okay. We welcome young herpes back into the community with open arms, with hopes that he will maybe be a little bit more reasonable about it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1336.0s)]
*  It's a great moment for young herpes to learn something instead of just regurgitating falsehoods breaking far right extremists and notorious races. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1348.0s)]

*  We will erase their smile again and replace it with griefs with cries of grief. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1417.0s)]
*  Gaza is destroyed and broken, uninhabitable, and it will remain so. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1422.0s)]

*  This is an animalistic society which sanctifies death and dances on the ruins of its life. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1429.0s)]
*  Very soon we will erase their smile and again and replace it with cries of grief and the wails of those who were left with nothing. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1434.0s)]
*  Fantastic stuff. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1442.0s)]
*  They're Nazis. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1443.0s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1444.0s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1446.0s)]
*  When there is no when there is no information, however, in Western news about the ways in which Israel's depraved government behaves identically to the fucking Nazi government of the past. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1447.0s)]

*  And in that misinformation, if someone presents themselves as pro-Palestinian, but then does unrestricted pro-Israel propaganda by not necessarily saying like what Israel is doing is super right, but instead by simply attacking all of his commentary focuses on naysayers of Israel, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wVIWG8a74&t=1463.0s)]
