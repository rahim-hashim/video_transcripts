# They're Discussing Hasan | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA)
*  What do you think of all that? What Hassan piker was telling Donnie? I wish he was paying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=0.0s)]
*  attention. I mean, it's patently absurd. Yeah, he's right. I wasn't paying attention. I don't [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=6.3s)]
*  know what I'm talking about. Well, it seems to me like Bakari sellers is not a fan of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=12.4s)]
*  mine. I will be showing the meme to him. Oh, Bakari sellers was, was, was asked about [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=17.8s)]
*  my one clip on CNN, bro. There's a lot going on this CNN. The, the, the CNN clip is making [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=29.98s)]
*  the rounds right now. It, it went on Fox news. It went on, it went on like a bunch of other [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=36.42s)]
*  CNN broadcasts and they're just, they just keep asking like Democrat party consultants. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=44.44s)]
*  Like what do you think about this clip from this male podcaster, the Joe Rogan of the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=49.46s)]
*  And yeah, you know, it's interesting to see it's interesting to see people, you know, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=55.42s)]
*  be tasked with having to respond to like the most normal question and objectively fail [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  to do so in the appropriate way. Don't ever ask a Democrat to do left populist policies. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=69.52s)]
*  Okay. Don't ever do it. It's like, it's, this is funny. Okay. People be like, this is my [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=75.7s)]
*  comfort show and then show you the most emotionally devastating, stress-inducing tragic piece [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=82.46s)]
*  of media you've ever witnessed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=86.02s)]
*  Hassan streams. Yeah, we will never have, we will never have self reflection. Do not [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=87.5s)]
*  ask us to reflect on pot save America. Love when you said the U S president needs to use [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=92.78s)]
*  agencies against democratic senators to give them consequences, especially using all the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=96.94s)]
*  actually the personal connections they use while in office. Yeah. I liked it. That was [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  too far to like actually hold politicians accountable and not let them get away with [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=107.5s)]
*  not let them get away with just doing right is, is like a shocking revelation. Like, yeah, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=114.62s)]
*  I'm fairly certain that most people, if they were to encounter that position the first [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=122.94s)]
*  time ever without ever considering it beforehand, they'd be like, no, that's great. I love that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  You know, that's my favorite thing. Please do that. I mean here, I'm not saying do this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=134.02s)]
*  former bank of China chairman sentenced to death for two year reprieve for bribery. I'm [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=138.9s)]
*  not saying that, but like maybe let's have some law and order, not for like the poor [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  Americans who are, you know, engaging in black market affairs specifically because they have [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  no other upward social mobility opportunities. But, but anyway, let's hear what, let's hear [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=155.38s)]
*  what the new, the new hit was from CNN. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  Social media superstar really with almost 3 million followers on the video streaming [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=164.46s)]
*  platform Twitch. He's a progressive fan of Bernie Sanders, so popular, Democratic Party [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=168.46s)]
*  invited him to the DNC in August and he sat down with CNN's Donio Sullivan. Here's a little [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=172.74s)]
*  bit. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  There's a general sense that when it comes to the world of podcasts, alternative media, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  I don't even know what you want to call it, that Trump did a much better job with that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=182.46s)]
*  than Democrats and Harris. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=186.9s)]
*  Absolutely. I think that's true. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=188.9s)]
*  Harris did consider going on Joe Rogan. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=193.14s)]
*  But she didn't. What is this that the Democrat Party has to do differently? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=194.14s)]
*  Well, I think that they need to change their policies. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=199.18s)]
*  It's a policy thing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=204.45999999999998s)]
*  Yes, it's 100% a policy thing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  Because I was saying, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=207.54s)]
*  Which is a boring answer. Although it would be very self-serving for me to say, I'm the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=208.54s)]
*  left's Joe Rogan, the Democrat. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=213.06s)]
*  I think even CNN are getting the same clips from Reddit. What are you talking about? This [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=215.14s)]
*  is CNN's own clips. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=219.74s)]
*  Democratic Party should give me millions of dollars. That's not going to solve this problem. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  What will solve this problem is if the Democratic Party actually adopts real left-wing economic [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=227.10000000000002s)]
*  populist messaging instead of purposely avoiding that stuff because they're terrified of upsetting [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=232.62s)]
*  their corporate donors. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=239.38s)]
*  I think Trump speaks to male insecurities better, and I think Trump speaks to the anger [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=240.9s)]
*  that people have. Whereas the other side of the political spectrum does not speak to that anger at all. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=245.88s)]
*  Joining us right now, CNN senior political commentator, Bakari Sellers and Lance Drover, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=250.88s)]
*  the former spokesperson for Doug Burgum when he was running in the... [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=255.68s)]
*  Burgamaniacs, rise up. Oh, if he only knew. If he only knew how much of a burgerhead I [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=259.48s)]
*  was, you know what I mean? If he only knew that I was a burgamaniac. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=264.88s)]
*  Republican presidential primary. It's good to see you guys. Thank you. Bakari, what do [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=270.4s)]
*  you think of all that? What Hassan Piker was telling Donnie? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=273.44s)]
*  I wish he was paying attention. I mean, it's patently absurd. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=277.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's right. I wasn't paying attention. I don't know what I'm talking about. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=280.64s)]
*  Well, it seems to me like Bakari Sellers is not a fan of mine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  To say that he wishes that Kamala Harris would adopt some populist economic policies. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=290.64s)]
*  Was he talking about the fact that she wanted to build three million new homes? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=296.92s)]
*  That's... Nah. That you misunderstood, my friend. You and I have very different [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=301.04s)]
*  understandings of what left populism looks like. If you think a private public partnership [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  and deregulating the housing sector is left economic populism, well, that's why you keep [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=313.6s)]
*  losing, Bakari. That's why the party keeps losing. It's not I that hasn't been paying [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  attention. It's you, my friend. Nah, that's fine. That's fine. We should just keep doing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=326.08s)]
*  this shit over and over again. Honestly. Yeah, that's good. This is good stuff. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=331.12s)]
*  With housing tax credits or was he talking about the child tax credit or the earned income tax credit? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  I like that everything that he suggested is a tax cut, by the way. This was another thing that I [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  mentioned in our, in my conversation with Pod Save America with the Pod John with John Love [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=348.4s)]
*  it where I was like, when you think about it, when you think about where the Democratic Party is now [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=353.92s)]
*  and the economic messaging that they have 40 years ago, like this would be considered the right wing [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=361.92s)]
*  position. That's what's so crazy about it. Like it's all tax credits and deregulation is all tax [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  credits and deregulation is tax cuts. Like that is crazy. That's crazy that this is like, oh, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  you don't understand. Kamala Harris is talking about the opportunity economy. That's left [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=381.76s)]
*  populism is like, no, it's not. And the reason why these guys, I can't tell if Bakari sellers here is [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=384.96s)]
*  just like genuinely lying on purpose. Like he knows better, but he's still lying. Or if he's just [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=390.96s)]
*  oblivious because he has never encountered someone in his immediate vicinity that goes, what are you [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  talking about? Like no one thinks this is cool. I mean, the economic policies that she laid out [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=402.4s)]
*  were numerous and she was the one who actually put forth policy plans. She put forth policy plans [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=409.76s)]
*  for African-American males. She put forth policy plans for Hispanic voters. So, I mean, I find it [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=415.76s)]
*  really troubled. Yeah, he didn't understand it. That's great. Okay. Yeah. He poured, he, she put [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=421.6s)]
*  forth policy plans for African-American voters. Like, dude, that doesn't work. It literally failed. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=427.92s)]
*  What's wrong with you? Hey, central committee, thank you for the raid. Hope you had a good stream, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=434.88s)]
*  brother. I love that. I love that he's, he's like, what are you talking about? Excuse me. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=438.48s)]
*  Tax credits for black men with cryptocurrency accounts. That's populism. I don't get it. Like [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  what it's like, dude, none of that shit worked. Why the are you talking about this? Can you give [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  me some examples of real left-wing populist economic policy? Yes. And I talked about the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  on-pod save America as well. A federal jobs program that actually builds socialized housing, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  builds public housing that actually claws back the housing market prices that draws it down by [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=466.0s)]
*  force. Okay. Left populist economic messaging dictates billionaires and corporations are the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=472.8s)]
*  enemy. Okay. You should just openly state that you should be like, no, these guys are the bad guys. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=479.92s)]
*  These are the people that are in your lives up. Okay. You don't like your boss. Now think about [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=484.88s)]
*  how bad your boss's boss actually is. Okay. Hyper-focused, hyper-targeted means-tested, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=490.24s)]
*  focus-tested messaging for means-tested policies are not effective. It's just not. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=499.2s)]
*  Nobody cares. Nobody understands it. You look like a boring nerdy loser when you talk about that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  Universal programs, universality is the key principle here. Okay. Bakari Sellers is a [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=512.24s)]
*  former somewhat progressive guy who just, you know, took a bag and went and had his like very [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=521.12s)]
*  open heel turn as always classic economic policies that she laid out were numerous. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  And she was the one who actually put forth policy plans. She put forth policy plans [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  for African-American males. She put forth policy plans for Hispanic voters. So, I mean, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=542.4s)]
*  I, that's so funny. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, I don't get it. Like what everybody loved. This doesn't [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=547.2s)]
*  make any sense. Everybody, everybody should have loved when Kamala Harris said, we're going to do [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  $50,000 in tax credits for black men that graduated from HBCU that work in a, you know, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=559.76s)]
*  underserved neighborhood for three and a half weeks. Like I don't, that was like a banger policy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=567.84s)]
*  Why would people, people are just too stupid to recognize how banger of policy it is. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=573.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? People are just too dumb. They're just too stupid. Why didn't it work? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=578.72s)]
*  I find it really troubling when people want to have a policy discussion. The fact is more people [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  know what was in Drake's law. Z-dubber thank you for the tank committee. Give this up. Yeah. No, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=588.96s)]
*  no, no. Look at that. Look at that. Look, look the ultimate, the ultimate point here is people [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  are too stupid. They just know about like Drake's lawsuit more than they know about commas policies. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=600.4000000000001s)]
*  People want to have a policy discussion. The fact is more people know what was in Drake's [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=604.48s)]
*  lawsuit against UMG. And they've actually studied that more than they studied Kamala Harris's policy [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=609.44s)]
*  proposals on social media. So I don't really want to hear a conversation about she should have [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=614.88s)]
*  put forth more economic policy proposals when- Let me at this man. Let me at this man. We are the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=620.32s)]

*  just like openly doing it. Where like they just don't give a shit. They're like, no, I'm trying to [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1249.04s)]
*  brigade this person. I'm trying to fucking go after anyone that even aligns with this person. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1253.76s)]
*  And it's like, it's a foolish endeavor. And I think ultimately, what, you know, this is like [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1260.32s)]
*  bricking people's brains, it makes them sadder. You know what I mean? You have a finite amount [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1268.6399999999999s)]
*  of time on this earth. Okay. This is the point I always make is like, is it making you happy? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1273.2s)]
*  Or is it making you sadder? Is are your actions actually contributing to your mental sanity? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1277.9199999999998s)]
*  Are your actions actually contributing to your life in a positive way? Or, or are they fucking [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1282.96s)]
*  your brain up a little bit? You know, and I think that it is, this is genuinely devastating [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1289.6s)]
*  for people's mental sanity for people's like, for people's attitudes is just not good. Like having [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1295.04s)]
*  spending a whole, spending so much time hyper focused on like taking out one guy and trying to [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1301.9199999999998s)]
*  ruin one person's reputation like this, especially when it doesn't fucking work is just, you know, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1312.1599999999999s)]
*  how do you think normal people like PSA watchers see hater comments like this? I don't think they [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1319.2800000000002s)]
*  see it. Most people don't fucking look at the comments. Like you already are not a normie if [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1323.0400000000002s)]
*  you're reading comments on a fucking YouTube video, you know, but yeah, the discourse on TikTok [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1328.0800000000002s)]
*  about this is genuinely mind blowing. Look at the comments. Oh, damn dude. Good one. Busted open. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1333.2800000000002s)]
*  And you're that you're the Hassan Abi girly too. Take a day off. Busted open is the is the OG [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1339.2800000000002s)]
*  Hassan Abi girly pop nation. The one that did the TikTok to be like Hassan Abi girly heads rise up. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1346.72s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, this is what I wanted. This is how can they do this during his anti-Semitism controversy? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1354.4s)]
*  Destiny is actually a supporter of the Democratic party. This is madness. At what point are we [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1359.52s)]
*  still going to admit that none of this has worked? He's still on Twitch, popular as ever. He's still [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1364.0s)]
*  on mainstream media. And now there's the pod save America thing too. Shit doesn't stick to this man. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1367.84s)]
*  It doesn't matter what he does. And the thing is, bro, I lost motivation. I don't know. I feel like [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1372.56s)]
*  we need to tune out for a bit. The fact that we're allowing live streaming terrorist propaganda [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1377.84s)]
*  straight into children's heads like nobody cares. And then that person gets featured on a mainstream [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1381.68s)]
*  democratic podcast with no pushback. What the fuck are we doing? See scratch the surface. You're [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1385.28s)]
*  close. Okay. To the people who are maybe hate watching right now, you're close to understanding [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1389.92s)]
*  the truth. Okay. When you get really invested in a community, including this one, okay. When you're [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1396.64s)]
*  in an online space like this, and you're constantly getting this kind of feedback, I promise you, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1403.2800000000002s)]
*  you become like a QAnon style individual. Okay. That's it. The constant feedback that you're [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1409.92s)]
*  getting from others who are like-minded, who are singularly focused on, you know, going after one [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1416.96s)]
*  person and saying this guy is like a fucking crazy guy. And all you're seeing are other clips [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1423.76s)]
*  that are also out of context, that are being negatively framed and priming you into believing [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1429.84s)]
*  that I'm this like evil fucking person, this singularly evil, ontologically evil person. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1435.12s)]
*  You are being misguided. Okay. You are being misguided. That's why what you're, the way you're [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1440.48s)]
*  seeing the world is directly at odds with so many others. They don't see it the same way that you do. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1446.96s)]
*  The problem is I'm not getting away with anything. I'm just not anti-Semitic. You know what I mean? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1451.76s)]
*  It's not like I'm secretly and cynically trying to do anti-Semitism and like get people into [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1457.52s)]
*  into a secret anti-Semitic bind. Okay. I'm not doing that at all, but you've been primed into [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1466.8799999999999s)]
*  believing that. And I don't know how to fucking fix that for you. Like you're just not, you are [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1473.92s)]
*  directly at odds with reality. That's the problem. That's it. And I think that that like you just [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1478.64s)]
*  keep, you can just keep saying over and over again, like, oh, he's just, it's just like Trump. He just [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1484.8000000000002s)]
*  has a cult or whatever, but like it's copium that no, the new thing is saying is you arriving at [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1490.96s)]
*  accidental anti-Semitism. That's ridiculous. I have actively fought back against anti-Semitism [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1496.16s)]
*  and probably educated many people in this community about what anti-Semitic markers look like [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1502.24s)]
*  okay. Like dog whistles look like the fuck are we talking about? And that's just a person moving [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1508.48s)]
*  the goalpost to try to like reframe the narrative and try to come up with like a better way to, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1514.24s)]
*  to, you know, smear me. That's it. What's worse is they're willing to put their community's mental [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1520.72s)]
*  health in the gutter just to get back at you. Yeah. And when it doesn't work, they're just like, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1525.52s)]
*  they double down and it's cultish thinking. And I know, I know, I know that there are people [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1529.04s)]
*  out there in these communities that care about the truth, that care about logic, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1537.0400000000002s)]
*  that care about critical thinking. And I think that a lot of people that fancy themselves as [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1542.48s)]
*  logical critical thinkers can still be easily duped when they find me as an ideological enemy and [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1547.92s)]
*  look for a sense of community. Okay. Can I offer you a reasoned rational response from the, what? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1554.8000000000002s)]
*  The, what? We will continue to hate watch. Hi, Hassan. No, fuck yourself. He does the same [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1561.84s)]
*  level of programming as Fox news with fake news. Bro's obsessed on Thanksgiving. We're not fucking [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1568.3999999999999s)]
*  skit. So stop saying wild shit. Blue went on. Hassan, we just hate you, bro. Nothing will change [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1574.0s)]
*  this. All right. I mean, I like that they're like, it's not weird that we are hate watching you on [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1579.52s)]
*  Thanksgiving. It's actually weird that you're even bringing up the active brigading efforts that we [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1584.7199999999998s)]
*  have contributed to that have failed, that is actually bricking our brains. I'm being charitable [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1590.64s)]
*  on Thanksgiving and I'm trying to be as nice as possible to all the eight watchers and telling [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1595.2s)]
*  him, look, like there's a reason why the way you see the world, okay. The way you see me is directly [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1598.8000000000002s)]
*  at odds. You can go to other places and there are plenty of places out there where people will say [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1606.0800000000002s)]
*  the same things that you want to hear. Okay. There are plenty of places online you can go to, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1612.3200000000002s)]
*  like the Keemstar orbiters, the drama farmers and the like, right. Where they'll be like, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1617.52s)]
*  no, he does suck. And you can find a shared sense of purpose there, but the broader community, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1621.92s)]
*  both online and outside of the internet, don't see it that way. One must interrogate the reasons why. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1628.0s)]
*  And it's not because they just haven't encountered the right clips. Okay. Dr. Mike is retail is a [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1634.8799999999999s)]
*  great example of this. The conversation that I had with him where he was like, oh, I read this [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1642.64s)]
*  thing where like someone was saying that like another person was claiming that you might've [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1647.44s)]
*  been anti-Semitic or whatever. And it's like, it's all cancel culture for a lot of people. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1651.2800000000002s)]
*  That's how they see it. Understandably. So because it is that it's not even real. Yeah. This is, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1655.76s)]
*  this is how normies look at this stuff for the most part. You know, you have editorial control [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1661.68s)]
*  over it, right? Like I'm live for eight hours a day talking about hot button issues, political stuff. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1665.76s)]
*  So a lot can be misconstrued purposely and things get clipped out of context deliberately. So [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1671.52s)]
*  there's like the good end of that. You know what I mean? I read an article about your recently that [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1676.4s)]
*  like, you know, you're an anti-Semite or whatever. Yeah. It was one of those articles where like the [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1680.8799999999999s)]
*  longer I read, the more I wanted to break my phone open. Cause I was like, you motherfuckers quoted a [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1685.36s)]
*  quote of a quote of a quote of some guy's tweet who alleged some very vague generality. It's like [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1689.84s)]
*  of a guy that you were on a panel with and the guy said some funny jokes and that guy was actually [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1695.12s)]
*  Jewish. And I was like, I read this shit anymore. Yeah. It was a classic example of like, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1700.08s)]
*  just take as much as you can in a context as possible. And it's just like, yeah, I'm sure you [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1704.72s)]
*  see a lot of stuff like, yeah, of course that stuff like that happens all the time, especially [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1709.6s)]
*  in political stuff. Because people have like a, an ideological perspective. They already hate you. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1712.8s)]
*  They're already, yeah, they're already primed. It's not real accountability. It's when it's [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1719.52s)]
*  nefariously nefariously enforced like this, there's no anti-Semites and was not as commentary and [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1724.3999999999999s)]
*  actively fights back against anti-Semites. And it comes across as hateful cancel culture. And it's [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1728.32s)]
*  pathetic that you will still spend your days using destiny's offline chat on his personal site. The [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1731.4399999999998s)]
*  group, Hey, watch us on. You can not seriously think you're normal for doing this. I don't think [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1734.8s)]
*  they think that they're normal. I think that they, I think that they think that what they're doing [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1737.9199999999998s)]
*  is good because like it, it reaffirms their sense of purpose. It gives them a sense of community. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1741.6799999999998s)]
*  You can find a sense of community elsewhere. You can find a sense of community here. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1747.12s)]
*  You know, I've, I, I always will be as charitable as, as humanly possible. Okay. To people, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1750.8799999999999s)]
*  a lot of people use that and abuse that and, and come in here and go, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1758.56s)]
*  just curious to just like say some bullshit, but you are not on a righteous cause. You're hustling. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1763.52s)]
*  You're doing QAnon shit and it's crazy. And I hope one day you can snap out of it. And I know, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1769.04s)]
*  and I know people do. I know, I know some people snap out of it. Some people are super primed. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1775.44s)]
*  They feel isolated. They feel alienated. They have nothing that's like, you know, guiding them. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1782.24s)]
*  And they feel like this, you know, being a part of this community is, is actively helping them [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1788.72s)]
*  feel like they have a sense of purpose in the world. But I know for a fucking fact that you can [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1795.44s)]
*  get better and you can snap out of it. I believe in you. I will always believe in you. And I hope [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1801.92s)]
*  you can do it. Even if you, you know, I hope you lead a better life regardless, even if it wasn't [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1806.88s)]
*  self-serving, I would want that for you. Anyway, everyone can change. It's not, it's not too late. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1813.68s)]
*  It's never too late to just open your eyes to the reality. Unhealthy food politics feels good and is [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1819.1200000000001s)]
*  bad for you. Oh, this is cock again to anyway. But yeah, it's the reception has been rather [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1825.2s)]
*  positive and I'm, I'm very appreciative of that. Where was, Oh, Adam McKay wants to come on the [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1832.32s)]
*  stream talking to him right now. The goat very exciting. Will came on and was like, Hey, Adam [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1838.0s)]
*  Hassan. And I would love to have you on our podcast. Maybe we can line up a stream podcast [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1844.0800000000002s)]
*  appearance one day. Yeah. It'd be great to have them on the pod as well. Kiwi here. I was a right [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1847.2s)]
*  winger until I started listening to cook like six months ago. I agree with maybe 95% of your [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1851.6s)]
*  core era now, which six months ago would have been insane bro. Three years ago, I came to the [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1855.6s)]
*  conclusion and finding a sense of community online is brain rot. Just watch your favorite streamer. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1860.0s)]
*  And once they're done streaming, don't fight their battles, live your lives and be happy. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1863.36s)]
*  Yeah, that too. That's definitely healthier as well for sure. What is this? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUASBCWNcnA&t=1868.32s)]
