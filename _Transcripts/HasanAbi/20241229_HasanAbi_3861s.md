# President Jimmy Carter Passes Away | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk)
*  But like for Jimmy Carter, I feel like they saw him as like a, like a pink Okami libtard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=0.0s)]
*  who loves, uh, jizing to the rest of the world for America's crimes or even though he wasn't. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Um, but I just don't know why they hate him that much. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=15.64s)]
*  To the 46th president of the United States, Joe. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=21.08s)]
*  The Israeli delegation is totally zipped up, even less is coming out of it than is coming out of the Egyptian delegation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=51.08s)]
*  The two men are back and forth between the two men and their teams, often negotiating late into the night. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=81.08s)]
*  Carter's national security advisor, the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, described what looked like mission impossible. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=87.36s)]
*  Sadat, to sign a peace treaty with Begin, had to break ranks with the entire Arab world. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  He had to face isolation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=100.32s)]
*  Begin, to agree with Sadat, had to give up territory for the first time and to give up settlements. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  When direct talks between Sadat and Begin became too heated, Carter kept them apart and quashed any attempt to call off the negotiations. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  After two weeks of complications, drama and false starts, the men finally returned to Washington to deliver the good news. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  They had reached a deal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=125.68s)]
*  Just look at two weeks ago, what the situation was. Peace process, all but dead. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=127.44s)]
*  An achievement none thought possible. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=132.24s)]
*  It appears that the president won and he won big. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  Decades after Camp David, I sat down with President Carter and asked him how in the world he had done it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=137.8s)]
*  There you were, you brought peace with Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=144.4s)]
*  It all seemed so much easier then, was it or is that just what we think now all these years later? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  I think it was much more difficult because I was negotiating between two men whose nations had been at war four times in just 25 years. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=156.12s)]
*  The magnitude of that accomplishment lives on in the image of that three-way handshake. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=164.76s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin summed it up like this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=170.24s)]
*  The Camp David conference should be renamed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=174.8s)]
*  It was the Jimmy Carter conference. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=178.16s)]
*  The final result, Israel would return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, a piece of land the two had fought wars over. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Egypt would finally recognize Israel's right to exist and give Israel access to the crucial Suez Canal shipping lanes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=190.4s)]
*  Both leaders declared no more fighting. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  All three men would eventually be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  But one thing wouldn't change. Arabs called Sadat a traitor. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=206.44000000000003s)]
*  Three years later, he was assassinated by Muslim extremists in his own country. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=211.08s)]
*  Still, many years later, President Carter told me that he was proud of this first peace deal between Arabs and Israelis. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=216.44s)]
*  The peace treaty that was negotiated between Israel and Egypt over extremely difficult circumstances was beneficial to both sides. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=225.28s)]
*  And not a single word of the treaty has been violated. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=233.96s)]
*  It was much more difficult than the altercation between the Israelis and the Palestinians yesterday. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=237.56s)]
*  And that conflict, the one between Palestinians and Israelis, still rages on to this day. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=243.76s)]
*  But it doesn't alter the fact that there was a shining moment when Jimmy Carter engaged the full and indispensable role of the United States and changed one corner of the Middle East forever. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=249.88s)]
*  Christiana Manpour, CNN, London. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=262.64s)]
*  All right, let's now bring in CNN chief national affairs correspondent, Jeff Zeleny. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  Jeff, good to have you. I want to follow up on something that we heard a short time ago from President Carter's biographer, Kai Bird, he said, in a lot of ways, President Carter was ahead of his times in many ways, particularly in foreign affairs. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=269.48s)]
*  Well, there is no question that he was ahead of his time in so many ways as an environmentalist, as a conservationist, and as we are really getting the reactions from Democrats and Republicans, American leaders. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=282.72s)]
*  I'm looking at one now from former President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=295.56s)]
*  They talk about how they met him in 1975. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=299.72s)]
*  They're praising his really post presidency work, also getting reaction from Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, praising his post presidency work. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=303.04s)]
*  The through line to this here is that Jimmy Carter believed that a president's afterlife, a post presidency, should not be a time to make profit, but actually a time to do good. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=313.68s)]
*  And that, of course, is something that is really the last of his kind in that respects. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=327.04s)]
*  He was not known to give big speeches leaving office. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=332.08s)]
*  But let's talk about him being in office for a moment. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=336.0s)]
*  You're right. He was ahead of his time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=339.24s)]
*  There's no question his protecting the lands of Alaska, his work on the Panama Canal and even putting solar panels on the White House. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=342.68s)]
*  And I was just actually watching a documentary over the weekend called A Carter Land, which is such a good encapsulation of his time in office. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  And he was talking about in the year 2000. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=362.36s)]
*  Of course, that seemed like a long time away in the 70s. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=365.96s)]
*  And but talking about the solar panels on the White House, of course, Ronald Reagan had them removed when he came into office. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  But when you look at his classic American story, he definitely was elected at 52 years old, but ahead of his time in so many ways. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=376.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to read a comment that we're getting in from the former president's son, Jeff. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=387.32s)]
*  I'll read it out for you. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=391.96s)]
*  It says, My father was a hero not only to me, but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights and unselfish love. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=393.64s)]
*  This is coming from Chip Carter. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=399.76s)]
*  He continued and said, My brother's sister and I shared with him with the rest of the world through these common beliefs. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=401.8s)]
*  The world is our family because of the way he brought people together. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=407.76s)]
*  And we thank you for honoring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=411.2s)]
*  You know, Jeff, in a lot of ways, he was sort of in a class of his own. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=415.68s)]
*  I mean, he was the oldest living former president. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=420.12s)]
*  He lived to 100. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=423.16s)]
*  He, you know, as we just said, he was a president sort of ahead of his time. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=425.48s)]
*  But talk to us a little bit about sort of how he even just in terms of how he sort of had this the second career after leaving office, that in and of itself was remarkable. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=429.92s)]
*  Well, it absolutely was. I mean, he, you know, was elected as a fresh face of the South in the wake of Watergate and in the anger from Vietnam. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=441.12s)]
*  And if we think of every presidential election as a series of, you know, a linked chain of events, his was the reaction to the Nixon administration and the Ford presidency and the anger in the country over President Ford pardoning Richard Nixon. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=451.2s)]
*  So he was the agent of change at that point. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=468.4s)]
*  But, of course, the economy and so many other things got in the way. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=471.28s)]
*  And his advisors at the time said, You're doing yes, this was in my prediction. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=475.96s)]
*  I would say perhaps some of this for the second term. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=479.6s)]
*  Of course, there was no second term. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=482.32s)]
*  Ronald Reagan handily defeated him. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=484.48s)]
*  But I think going back to Jimmy Carter, he had a if you look through these documentaries and if you walk through the Carter Center in Atlanta, as I have several times, the pictures in the Oval Office is the buck stops here. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=487.08s)]
*  Of course, that's the Harry Truman line. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=501.12s)]
*  But also it's something that he took to heart. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=502.8s)]
*  And as we are looking here at statements still coming in an interesting line here from Senator Mitch McConnell, he said President Carter served during times of tension and uncertainty, both at home and abroad. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  But his calm spirit and deep faith seemed unshakable and faith, I think, for hell is something that is center is central to Jimmy Carter's life. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=519.0s)]
*  Of course, we remember seeing him at the funeral of his wife of 77 years, Rosalind, just a little over a year ago. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=529.6s)]
*  And now he has taken his lead reunited with her. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=537.6s)]
*  So an American love story and American original in so many ways will be celebrated over the next several days as his funeral plans begin to take shape. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=541.36s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Jeff, that's a really important point. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=552.28s)]
*  It's something that we hadn't touched on yet, but just his faith and sort of how crucial that was and the way that he lived his life. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=554.44s)]
*  Jeff, thank you. I want to now bring in for a moment, Kai Bird, who was with us now. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=562.36s)]
*  Kai, I mean, you have had the the privilege of, you know, working with Jimmy Carter quite closely. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=567.24s)]
*  Give us a sense, if you might, of some personal anecdotes or any stories that really stood out to you. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=574.72s)]
*  Well, you were speaking about Cam David and his intervention to achieve a peace treaty in the Middle East. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=581.0s)]
*  You know, he took on this issue with no background in it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=589.6s)]
*  He was just that good. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=594.48s)]
*  His advisors all told him not to do it, that it was dangerous territory. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=597.72s)]
*  And yet Carter, you know, was a very well read man and he thought he was the intelligent, most intelligent guy in the room and he could educate himself on this issue. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=603.04s)]
*  And he just decided this is something that is really important to do. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  And I'm going to use my powers of the presidency to make something happen where no one else has been able to go go to that territory. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=617.4s)]
*  And over the objections of Zbigniew Brzezinski, his national security adviser, he organized this Camp David retreat and invited Anwar Sadat and Menahem Begum. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=627.9599999999999s)]
*  And over 13 days, it was an incredible drama of personal diplomacy in which he forced them to stay there. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=640.9200000000001s)]
*  They tried both tried to leave on at least two occasions, and he managed to keep them there for 13 days and iron out an agreement. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=651.2s)]
*  And it had a sort of critical tipping point, just as Menahem Begum was about to storm out once again. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=663.44s)]
*  Carter came over to Menahem Begum's cabin in Camp David and brought with him photographs of himself and Begum and Sadat. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=670.44s)]
*  And he had signed to his grandchildren, to Begum's grandchildren, and he'd gotten their names and he handed these little gifts. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=685.0s)]
*  And this caused the very stern and staid Begum to break down and start weeping because Carter had inscribed them for peace for our grandchildren. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=694.92s)]
*  And this was sort of brought home to Begum that he was missing an opportunity. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=709.0799999999999s)]
*  And at that point, he said, OK, I'll go back. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=714.76s)]
*  I'll negotiate one more round with you. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=718.0s)]
*  And out of that came the Camp David Accords, which are still in effect. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=720.56s)]
*  They brought peace between Egypt and Israel. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=728.52s)]
*  And yet there was a missed opportunity because Carter always believed that he also got the outlines for a peace between Israel and the Palestinians as well. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  And that, of course, is a very controversial argument that historians are still trying to figure out all these decades later. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=744.76s)]
*  Yeah, I want to ask you to weigh in on something my colleague, Jeff Zeleny, had just mentioned there toward the end of our conversation. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=755.28s)]
*  But the importance of Jimmy Carter's faith in the way in which he pursued his work and the way in which he pursued the issues and the causes that were important to him. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=763.16s)]
*  Yes, faith mattered a great deal to him. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=773.4s)]
*  He was a Southern Baptist. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=776.76s)]
*  He thought of Israel and Palestine as the Holy Land. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=779.04s)]
*  And he just thought it was a tragedy that war was being fought in the Holy Land. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=783.6s)]
*  And he believed that he had studied the issue enough to understand what a compromise might look like. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=790.4399999999999s)]
*  Two states for two peoples and territorial compromises and sharing of Jerusalem and all of that was sort of set in. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=798.4s)]
*  Am I crazy? I thought he famously didn't know shit. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=810.4s)]
*  Well, he didn't know anything with the exception of like maybe some biblical text and also Camp David Accords unironically solidified Israel's position of dominance over the Palestinians. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=814.72s)]
*  We're seeing it's ironic, but Jimmy Carter was dealing with Israel, Palestine, Iran, revolutionary Iran, the same issues we're dealing with today. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  But if he had got agreement from Megan in 1978 to freeze the settlements in the West Bank, no more building of settlements in the West Bank for five years, that would have been a huge step. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=838.36s)]
*  That would have led inevitably, I would argue, to a two state solution. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=851.32s)]
*  And here we are decades later. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=857.5200000000001s)]
*  And Jimmy Carter always believed that this was his biggest failure in the presidency, that he he didn't somehow get that pin down. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=860.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's such an interesting point, Kai. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=870.36s)]
*  I mean, what do you make of some of the parallels between his time in office and sort of present day 2024, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=873.12s)]
*  whether we're talking about Iran, whether we're talking about the conflict in the Middle East and you mentioned Paul Volcker earlier, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=879.76s)]
*  the Federal Reserve chair who was in charge of fighting the highest inflation that we had seen in years and we have seen since then. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=885.4s)]
*  And so it is just sort of remarkable, the parallels between his time in office and 2024. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=895.64s)]
*  Yeah, this is why Carter's presidency, not just his ex presidency, but his presidency is so relevant to us today because he was grappling with these extremely difficult issues that he took on head on, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=902.12s)]
*  including energy, race, religion, climate change, as we've discussed, peace in the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=917.08s)]
*  How long ago do you think they had this video ready to go? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=927.48s)]
*  People start writing obituaries so early on. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=930.76s)]
*  Famously, Henry Kissinger had co-writers on his New York Times obituary. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=934.64s)]
*  Some of them died before Henry Kissinger died. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  A solution in Israel, Palestine or race or the separation of religion and state, which is something that Carter Southern Baptist was very much committed to. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=943.36s)]
*  So his presidency is is oddly relevant in a way that I think most Americans don't understand or have forgotten. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=959.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's a really interesting point. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=969.1999999999999s)]
*  Kai Bird, we so appreciate you being with us on this breaking news. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=971.12s)]
*  Again, former President Jimmy Carter has died at the age of 100. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=974.88s)]
*  And thank you for joining me today. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=978.48s)]
*  We're going to continue to cover this breaking news. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=979.76s)]
*  Omar Jimenez picks up now. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=981.52s)]
*  This is CNN breaking news. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=983.3199999999999s)]
*  We begin this hour with breaking news. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=986.08s)]
*  Former President Jimmy Carter has died at the age of 100. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=987.76s)]
*  The Carter Center says the 39th president died this afternoon surrounded by family in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=991.84s)]
*  The former president had been in home hospice care since February of 2023, but Carter became the oldest living former president when he when he surpassed the record held by the late George H.W. Bush in March of 2019. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=999.6s)]
*  Carter, a Georgia peanut farmer and a lifelong Democrat, served a single term as president from 1977 to 1981, losing a reelection reelection bid to Ronald Reagan. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1013.2s)]
*  Now, his presidency was defined by blows to America's economy and conflicts overseas. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1024.08s)]
*  But his most enduring legacy came after his presidency, winning a Nobel Peace Prize and redefining himself as a human rights pioneer. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1030.0s)]
*  Joining us now, CNN's Jake Tapper takes a look at how former President Carter spent his long life embracing faith and how it shaped his life and career. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1038.24s)]
*  I, Jimmy Carter, do solemnly swear. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1045.76s)]
*  Jimmy Carter faced the American presidency the same way he faced nearly everything else in his life with unflinching faith. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1047.92s)]
*  I have the second of office on the Bible my mother gave me just a few years ago. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1056.0s)]
*  And as Americans look to President Carter to lead them, President Carter looked to God for guidance. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1062.96s)]
*  With God's help and for the sake of our nation, it is time for us to join hands in America. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1069.92s)]
*  As a devout evangelical, the pride of Plains, Georgia was active in his hometown church well into his 90s. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1077.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you for coming this morning. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1084.96s)]
*  Both as a student of faith and as a teacher. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1086.72s)]
*  My father was a Sunday school teacher. He taught me when I was a child. I still teach Sunday school when I can. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1090.48s)]
*  A commitment to God and family were long-held hallmarks of the Carter home. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1097.6s)]
*  The scripture was part of his daily childhood life. Every night at supper, they would not only say the Lord's prayer, but would read the gospel. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1102.8s)]
*  When Carter left home for the Naval Academy, his faith followed. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1113.04s)]
*  He would spend his weekends on leave doing Bible classes, tutoring people in scripture. He talks about Jesus Christ all the time. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1116.96s)]
*  But in 1966, the lifelong Christian came to question his beliefs, his faith shaken after losing the Georgia governor's race in the primary. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1127.2800000000002s)]
*  I really felt let down by God. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1136.4s)]
*  Carter's younger sister read him scripture from the book of James, reminding the future president. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1138.96s)]
*  That a setback in life should be an institution that results in perseverance and patience and self-analysis and renewed spiritual commitment. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1144.8s)]
*  She made him into what evangelicals called a born-again Christian. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1156.48s)]
*  With renewed conviction, Carter went on to serve as Georgia's governor and later as America's commander-in-chief. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1161.92s)]
*  The 39th president and his new vice president, Walter Mondale, had Christianity in common. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1168.88s)]
*  They bonded over it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1174.32s)]
*  I grew up in a minister's family and he recognized what I was about. And I think that's one of the things that pulled us together. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1175.9199999999998s)]
*  It was also one of the qualities that helped Carter become the first president to welcome the pope to the White House. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1183.76s)]
*  Let all of us here of every faith stand as one under God for peace and justice and for love. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1189.6799999999998s)]
*  The president's knowledge of world religion played a key role in his brokering of the Egypt-Israel peace treaty in 1979. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1197.84s)]
*  Yeah, using a religious framework to try to solve a colonialist conquest is fucking hilarious. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1205.04s)]
*  Like, there you go. Oh, it happened already. It happened for Carter as well. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1216.48s)]
*  The thing that I was talking about with respect to how sometimes you have people who outlive their obituary writers. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1221.28s)]
*  What the fuck? Why can't I actually move this? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1227.28s)]
*  Ahem. Here it is. Jimmy Carter outlived one of his obituary writers. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1230.4s)]
*  Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for the time, Roy Reed, who died in 2017, was a Times national correspondent who for many years covered the South. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1236.16s)]
*  Yeah, obituary writers sometimes like start writing the obituary so long ago that like they fucking pass away before the subject dies. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1242.24s)]
*  The Amesake Carter Center touched the lives of millions. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1251.12s)]
*  Well, the work at the Carter Center has been, I'd say, more personally gratifying to me. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1255.12s)]
*  Founded in 1982 as part of his presidential library, the Carter Center has worked to ensure the fairness of more than 100 elections in nearly 40 countries. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1259.44s)]
*  Loki, one of the most like pro-Venezuelan institutions in America. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1268.96s)]
*  The guinea worm that had long burdened parts of Africa. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1272.8s)]
*  Guinea worm is probably one of the oldest diseases remembered by human beings. It's in the Bible. We think it's a fiery serpent. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1276.0s)]
*  For his work, Jimmy Carter earned the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1283.9199999999998s)]
*  In addition to his philanthropic work, Jimmy Carter was a prolific author. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1288.56s)]
*  He published more than 25 books touching on his belief in God, country, and kindness. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1292.48s)]
*  You only have to have two loves in your life, he wrote, for God and for the person in front of you at any particular time. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1299.36s)]
*  The person with Carter most was his wife Rosalynn, who worshipped alongside him for more than seven decades. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1307.28s)]
*  When I'm overseas or when she is, we read the same passage in the Bible and we kind of, you know, communicate silently. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1313.84s)]
*  Even when cancer threatened to take Mr. Carter from his wife and from the life he loved, he kept his faith and looked again to God. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1323.36s)]
*  Now I feel, you know, that's in the hands of... [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1331.52s)]
*  Interesting, there was a book that mentioned Israel-Palestine in there, but not the one that calls Israel an apartheid. I wonder why. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1334.16s)]
*  And I want to bring in CNN. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1341.84s)]
*  There was a Israel-Palestine book in there, you know, Peace in the Holy Land or whatever, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1343.04s)]
*  but there wasn't the one where he openly says, Palestine not apartheid or peace not apartheid. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1346.72s)]
*  ...is on the phone and Chip Carter, the former president's son, said, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1351.9199999999998s)]
*  my father was a hero not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights and unselfish love. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1354.9599999999998s)]
*  And I guess, Jeff, I bring that quote up because for President Carter there's almost two chapters, two major chapters in his legacy. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1361.4399999999998s)]
*  Of course his time in office... [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1369.84s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm a product of American Presidents, American education system, but doesn't that seem bad? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1371.4399999999998s)]
*  He doesn't seem that bad compared to other presidents? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1376.32s)]
*  No, especially for like all of his work post presidency, which is valid. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1378.08s)]
*  Like he's just like kind of a like a dunderhead, you know, a really religious guy, actually a religious guy, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1383.04s)]
*  not like fake religious in the way that... not fake religious in the way that Trump is, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1392.48s)]
*  and certainly not insane religious in the way that like Mike Pence is, right? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1398.1599999999999s)]
*  He is like the classic religious guy that's like, I want to abide by my faith and I want to do the things that, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1403.2s)]
*  you know, the Bible tells me to do, good things, good things for others, you know, be kind to individuals, that kind of thing. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1412.48s)]
*  And in spite of all of that, of course, he was still tasked with doing horrifyingly monstrous things as the President of the United States. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1418.96s)]
*  Also, a lot of people like they're in the Republican Party, historically have hated him and have hailed him as like... [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  Pre-Obama, everyone used to point to Carter as like the worst president, okay? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1435.4399999999998s)]
*  He created the Department of Education. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the federal bench and began the process of diversifying the courts. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1440.32s)]
*  Up until he became president, only eight women were on the federal bench. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1450.6399999999999s)]
*  What is it? Where is it? Oh, it's just showing different recommended articles. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1456.32s)]
*  Let's see if I can find it. It's probably a meme. Let's see what the meme is. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1460.48s)]
*  Search meme. What was it? Hassanabi women? Oh, this is it. They're my blast off memes, you dummies. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1464.24s)]
*  I very quickly will write out, like when I post it in the memes folder, I very quickly just like type something out. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1471.12s)]
*  Then I'm going to post on Twitter. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1478.6399999999999s)]
*  Where is the Dua Lipa one? What is the poo folder? Oh, that's like tax documents and shit. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  You accidentally showed your short stack goblin porn. Yeah, I don't fucking watch porn on my work computer. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1492.32s)]
*  And I also don't download porn. I feel like that. I feel like downloading porn is degenerate shit. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1498.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, I feel like that's the first step towards becoming like an actual gooner porn addict. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1505.28s)]
*  Like I've never watched a porn where I was like, damn, I really need to save this. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1509.36s)]
*  Like I really need to, I don't know if I'll ever be able to have access to this again. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1513.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm a Philistine, but my porn consumption habits are pretty, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1517.92s)]
*  they're pretty like base. So you go porn hub. Like back in the day, back in the day, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1525.6000000000001s)]
*  obviously I used to download a lot of porn because I was in Turkey. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1531.6000000000001s)]
*  Porn was not as readily accessible and easy to come by. But now it seems crazy. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1535.1200000000001s)]
*  I actually don't know why, like what the, what the inflection point is for why so many Republicans [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1541.04s)]
*  hate Carter. Cause like the, the hatred they have for him is, is far more severe. Like they hate Bill [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1547.92s)]
*  Clinton. They hate Obama. They hate Obama the most. We know what it is for Barack Obama, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1554.0s)]
*  for Barack Obama. It's obviously being black first and foremost, but like for Jimmy Carter, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1559.04s)]
*  I feel like they saw him as like a, like a pink Okami libtard who loves apologizing to the rest [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1564.8s)]
*  of the world for America's war crimes or whatever, even though he wasn't. But I just don't know why [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1573.9199999999998s)]
*  they fucking hate him that much. Essentially from a president and of course high profile work [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1580.08s)]
*  afterward as well. I mean, how difficult was it to, to lead the life that they live and just what, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1585.68s)]
*  what kind of example did they set? Do you believe for the country and world that large [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1592.1599999999999s)]
*  in just their relationship? I think it could be like a similar dynamic to how liberals despise [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1597.12s)]
*  leftist because from their perspective, like it makes them kind of look back at their own [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1602.8s)]
*  ideological shortcomings. Like that's why liberals hate liberal policies to hate like [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1610.56s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, for example, because they look to Bernie Sanders and they're like, you're a fucking [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1615.6s)]
*  piece of shit because you are really pushing. You're really pushing the needle. And for maybe [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1620.64s)]
*  like conservative religious freaks there, they hate that he's like, at least his output in his [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1625.76s)]
*  individual life was like of a deeply religious man who was not a bad guy. They're really just [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1631.68s)]
*  drafting off the anger that people felt against Carter. America literally ran out of gasoline. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1635.92s)]
*  He couldn't fill your tank during his presidency. Imagine what the treat, uh, treatlers would do. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1640.32s)]
*  Yeah. And Adolf treatlers would do if that happened in the U S $10 a gallon gas. That's [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1644.08s)]
*  sure the boomers were so angry. Yeah. I guess that's what it is. That's got to be like the [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1648.4s)]
*  most significant part of this, right? A piece of words at Camp David. It was actually her idea [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1652.0800000000002s)]
*  to do it there because she was close with Sadat and his wife. And, and one of those stories that [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1658.0s)]
*  I think Kai mentioned before that I just love is that, you know, the personal touch that they both [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1662.72s)]
*  had and the fact that when things were looking bad during Camp David, it was Jimmy Carter who gave [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1668.72s)]
*  Bagan this signed photograph and said, give it to your grandchildren. And that's what brought [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1675.28s)]
*  Bagan back to the negotiating table. Oh my God. I don't care about this. Iran plus Reagan being [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1680.8s)]
*  seen as a great Jesus. Now most older people hate him because during the Iranian hostage crisis, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1685.44s)]
*  Republicans thought Carter should have bombed Iran was Jimmy Carter dying in your 2024 predictions. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1688.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes, it was. Um, but that's like not that interesting. What's actually interesting is [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1693.12s)]
*  that not only was it in my predictions, um, it wasn't, it wasn't in just my predictions, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1698.56s)]
*  but I literally said a couple of days ago, I said a couple of days ago that, um, that, you know, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1704.16s)]
*  there's still time for the year to end when people were making fun of me for predicting Joe, uh, that [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1711.28s)]
*  Jimmy Carter, uh, uh, Jimmy Carter would die in 2024. That's what's, uh, interesting about it. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1716.3200000000002s)]
*  I think, or at least somewhat interesting about it is that like he did, he did do a buzzer beater. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1722.72s)]
*  Did you write his name in your notebook? Yeah, I have a death note and I wrote Jimmy Carter's [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1727.44s)]
*  name on it. That's fucking crazy. Um, all right, let's go back to this and I'm going to give you [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1731.12s)]
*  some, uh, Sunday school, some more critical stuff at Marinatha Baptist church. He did this more than [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1737.6799999999998s)]
*  2000 times well into his nineties and anybody who got the chance to sit and listen to him speak, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1745.1999999999998s)]
*  you look over at Rosalind and she just looked adoringly at him. So it was the pinnacle of his [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1752.4799999999998s)]
*  life marrying her. And I think she felt the same, you know, when he lost in the landslides, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1758.32s)]
*  Ronald Reagan, she was devastated and she never quite got over it. She thought the country made a [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1763.36s)]
*  huge mistake by not electing, reelecting. So this was a partnership that continued well after the [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1768.96s)]
*  white house. Yeah. And I went to be Carter, Don Brownstein back into the conversation. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1775.84s)]
*  One of my last remaining predictions from 2024 came through president Jimmy Carter's legacy here. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1782.08s)]
*  And Ron, you know, I can't help when you look at it politically, it's, it's almost hard not to see [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1787.3600000000001s)]
*  some of the parallels politically in our environment today that we saw back when he was in office as [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1792.08s)]
*  well. I mean, you know, inflation was one of the biggest issues in this past election. And we know [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1797.2s)]
*  during his time, that was something that was a major struggle in this country. And I just want [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1801.3600000000001s)]
*  to use that as jumping off point. Do you see many similarities? Wait, what did Trump say? Oh my God. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1806.24s)]
*  Oh my God. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. What's the Elton John song that was playing when [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1813.8400000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump responded to RB? Yeah. Okay. Hold on. I got a new Trump tweet just dropped. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1819.68s)]
*  Yeah. Oh yeah. You want to come read it? Okay. Hold on. We're not going to do this yet because [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1828.4s)]
*  I'm waiting for Alexander Lolo to come and read it. Okay. Your mic is on. Hey, chat. Sorry guys. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1834.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm leaving. I'm leaving tomorrow. Okay. And I won't be here anymore. Thank God dude. Fucking [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1842.48s)]
*  thank God. You greatly overstayed your welcome. All right. Jimmy Carter died. I don't know if you [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1848.08s)]
*  knew that. I'm going to take, yeah. Yeah. I, I heard the news. Very sad. All right. He was only [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1857.04s)]
*  a hundred. So young, so young. Who could have thought anyway here? Are you doing it in the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1863.1200000000001s)]
*  background? Yeah. Just heard the news about the passing of president Jimmy Carter. Those of us [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1868.4s)]
*  who have been fortunate enough to have served as president understand that this is a very exclusive [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1874.48s)]
*  club and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the greatest nation [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1880.0800000000002s)]
*  in history. The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country. And [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1885.92s)]
*  frankly, he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans, not as much as me, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1892.24s)]
*  but a lot for that. We are, we all owe him a debt of gratitude. Melania and I are thinking [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1897.2s)]
*  warmly of the Carter family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1904.56s)]
*  keep them in their hearts and prayers. That was pretty good. Thank you. This is the forever. I [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1909.92s)]
*  think whenever Trump tries to eulogize someone, I'm going to play that song. Yeah. It has to be [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1915.52s)]
*  played in the background. This is a pretty nice message. Yeah. It's kind of surprising that he [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1920.4s)]
*  didn't go. Carter was the worst American president. A big time loser as we know. Yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1924.56s)]
*  Major loser. Couldn't cut it two times now. Yeah. He tried to put solar panels on the White House. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1930.24s)]
*  But just like sleepy Joe Biden, his defeat brought back one of the greatest, second greatest [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1936.24s)]
*  American presidents. Joe Biden's defeat brought me back and Carter brought Ronald Reagan, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1944.32s)]
*  who is not the greatest president, but the second after myself. That's how you know he didn't write [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1952.08s)]
*  it. Yeah. Your cousin probably wrote this. Yeah. Did you guys, oh, speaking of which, do you guys [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1958.1599999999999s)]
*  think I should go to the inauguration? Can you, how tight do you want to go? How tight are you? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1963.36s)]
*  Me and Danny? Yeah. We're not tight at all, but him, his mom and my mom are tight. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1968.7199999999998s)]
*  You think you can get me into the inauguration? If you want to go, as long as you're not, as long [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1974.3999999999999s)]
*  as you don't cause problems, you could probably come. Why would I cause problems? What problems [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1979.2s)]
*  could I cause? Cause you're an Antifa. You're an Antifa terrorist. No, I'm not. I'm, dude, I'm [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1982.64s)]
*  literally misogynistic and I, uh, revel in the death of homeless. This is crazy. You're going to go, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1987.28s)]
*  this is the big heel turn guys. He's going to go to the inauguration. Yeah. He's going to go on road. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1992.72s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to outflank Jake. Like shaky Gerga thinks he can do this. Here, let me text my [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=1997.04s)]
*  mom right now. She texted me this morning. Also, she liked the video that we sent for some reason, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2001.8400000000001s)]
*  even though you called me autistic in it. She's like, that's nice. I like his son. That's what [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2005.36s)]
*  she said. Really? Yeah. What does your mom sound like female Donald Trump in this impersonation? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2010.8799999999999s)]
*  Why are you doing her like that? As messed up more evidence of a song's right. We're shift. Yeah. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2016.24s)]
*  Jimmy, Jimmy. What's Jimmy's last name? Jimmy Donaldson. Fantastic. One of our best presidents, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2022.0s)]
*  Mr. B of the world didn't really. All right. Well, I'm going to take this stuff out of here. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2027.84s)]
*  Lyndon Johnson, you know, same. I will bring my own maga hat to the fucking inauguration. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2034.48s)]
*  I think I'm really, I think that's a little too on the nose. A former president, why should we [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2039.3600000000001s)]
*  wear a maga hat to the inauguration? I think that's crazy. Positive change around the world. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2043.84s)]
*  And you know, he sort of, it's like, it's like a new model, you know, that's what he's going to do. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2049.12s)]
*  He's going to make America great again in our history. You can, you can, you can say that about, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2053.28s)]
*  but they just sort of created something that really re-imagined, you know, I, I, I fuck with [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2057.12s)]
*  Jimmy Carter at that point, you know, almost 200 years. But none had really, he's probably the only [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2061.44s)]
*  good like post that he did talk about that. And I think he has created a model that to very [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2067.28s)]
*  extensive other presidents, I think now see as part of, you know, kind of what you are expected [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2072.7200000000003s)]
*  to do when you leave office. I mean, he ran a tremendously racist campaign to become a [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2079.52s)]
*  partner's engagement with so many different causes for so long. Right. He was governor. And this, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2084.48s)]
*  of course, as we continue to see the images of the American flag, staff, and it just speak to some [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2088.72s)]
*  of what you were talking about, you know, they founded the Carter Center in Atlanta in partnership [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2093.68s)]
*  with Emory University in 1982. And those initiatives included monitoring international elections, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2098.08s)]
*  fighting diseases and developing countries seeking international, look how good I am. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2103.12s)]
*  Look at that. Where am I pulling that from? I don't even remember what I was eating for breakfast yesterday. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2106.56s)]
*  For more than three million cases in 1986 to 14. Just kidding. I've been eating a breakfast burrito every single day that I've been in Los Angeles. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2111.68s)]
*  In 2023. And he, of course, got the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor for an American [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2116.56s)]
*  civilian in 1999. I mean, the impact, I mean, just those numbers alone, reading out of the disease [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2121.52s)]
*  essentially being eradicated over just a few decades is pretty remarkable. But I guess what I, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2128.3999999999996s)]
*  what my mind goes to now is how does that work continue? I mean, obviously he's set such a [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2135.68s)]
*  standard and even while he maybe was not as mobile and as public as maybe he would have liked to be, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2142.16s)]
*  understandably so, you know, he was around 100 years old leading up to it. But where is that [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2148.48s)]
*  source of light? Where is that momentum? How does that work continue at a level that Jimmy Carter? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2154.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm good. No, I'm staying one more day because I have to interview this big idiot. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2162.4s)]
*  You're, I'm putting you on speaker. You're on stream. There's a, how many people are watching? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2166.24s)]
*  I'm putting you, I'm putting you on speakerphone. I don't want to be on speakerphone. Okay. You're [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2171.2s)]

*  really problematic. It's 26,000. Hello. Mom, it's Hassan. Mom, Hassan wants to go to the inauguration. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2179.2799999999997s)]
*  That'd be great. Oh no, absolutely not. Why not? No. Is Kathy going? Yes, of course. Yeah. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2188.56s)]
*  Can Hassan go? He'll be really good. He doesn't want to go to the parties. He wants to just [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTJfKAB9wk&t=2195.76s)]
