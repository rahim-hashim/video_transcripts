# Trump Works With Putin As Nato And Europe Sidelined | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o)
*  it definitely stopped Vladimir Putin from taking Kiev. Okay. 100%. It played a pretty major role, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=0.0s)]
*  especially in the interim from 2014 onward, where Ukraine was able to build a standing military [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=7.68s)]
*  played a very significant role in them stopping Russia's offensive campaign. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  All right. Is Donald Trump still doing press conferences? I believe he will continue with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=21.36s)]
*  the Modi press conference in a little bit, but let's get started on Ukraine. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=33.68s)]
*  Donald Trump coming in hot and doing things about Ukraine that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=40.96s)]
*  European leaders feel sidestepped on seemingly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=47.6s)]
*  On Russian television, they could scarcely contain their glee. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=56.64s)]
*  Again, American prisoner released from a Moscow jail this week, the anchorwoman asks, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=64.72s)]
*  has Russia been promised Kiev or Odessa? President Trump, she says, has an excellent friendship with [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=70.4s)]
*  President Putin. And what about the Northern line is not acknowledging your comments. Disrespect [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=77.36s)]
*  is real. He can disrespect me if he wants. I still love him. Cranium president visiting a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=82.8s)]
*  proposed nuclear power plant. President Trump called him after speaking to President Putin last [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=88.16s)]
*  night. It's important that everything does not go according to Putin's plan. He wants to make all [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=94.32s)]
*  his negotiations bilateral between him and the United States. But we as a sovereign country [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=102.24s)]
*  simply will not be able to accept any agreements taken without us. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=108.08s)]
*  But this was Trump on Ukraine a few days ago. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=114.56s)]
*  Like the difference between Trump and Joe Biden or any Democratic leadership is that a Democrat [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=118.24s)]
*  will never actively say, will never openly say the truth. They'll never say [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  Ukrainian autonomy is insignificant in this process. They will, as a matter of fact, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  consistently say we are behaving in the interest of our incredibly important allies. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=135.84s)]
*  But the reality of the matter is what is Trump, what Trump is saying. It doesn't matter what the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=142.24s)]
*  Democrats say. What matters is what the Democrats do. Just like it doesn't matter what Trump says, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=147.12s)]
*  what matters is what Trump does. Okay. So while Democrats will maintain the aesthetics [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=152.72s)]
*  and maintain civility, yes, of course, they also did not listen to the demands made by Zelensky [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=159.92s)]
*  on numerous occasions. Zelensky kept asking for more weapons. Zelensky kept asking for different [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  kinds of weapons. Air support. Zelensky wanted to do a flight free, like they wanted to create [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  a security zone above Ukrainian airspace. Okay. They wanted to do a no-fly [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=183.2s)]
*  zone. This would require American and NATO forces to constantly fly over [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  the area and blow up Russian flights, blow up Russian air cover. Okay. This would have been [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=197.44s)]
*  a direct, this would have obviously been a hot war between nuclear powers, NATO nations, the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=207.76s)]
*  United States of America and Russia. They never did that. Okay. Biden gave billions to Ukraine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=216.0s)]
*  What the F are you talking about? My point is regardless of what Ukraine's demands were, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=221.04s)]
*  no matter how moral or how just, so giving Ukraine to Putin is the same as not supplying every [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=228.0s)]
*  request by Zelensky. What the F is this take? Okay. You are failing to comprehend the point I'm making. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=232.8s)]
*  The point I'm making is that Ukrainian interests in this process, I'm going to, I'm going to, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=240.08s)]
*  I'm going to walk through this slowly, but surely. Okay. There were plenty of needs that Ukraine had [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=245.52s)]
*  after the invasion. Okay. The democratic administration did not abide by all of those [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=253.44s)]
*  needs. The democratic administration did not turn around and give everything that Zelensky asked to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=260.8s)]
*  Ukraine. Okay. They never would turn around and be like, Zelensky doesn't, you know, Zelensky doesn't [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=266.8s)]
*  order us. We order him. They would never say the truth of the matter. Okay. And some of you, I think [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=273.2s)]
*  some of you, I think were, you, you fell for this consent being manufactured. You fell for this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=283.92s)]
*  idea that like the Democrats actually did care about all of the emancipatory needs of Ukraine [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  and that it was actually a moral interest that America had. It was not. And I kept repeating [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=298.56s)]
*  this over and over again. Okay. Donald Trump turning around and saying the quiet part out loud [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=304.32s)]
*  does not change the dynamic. Okay. That's it. Fell for it again. Award back to back champion. Yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  You should remain neutral in politics, this on thank you. You know, they may make a deal. They [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=318.8s)]
*  may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=324.0s)]
*  The new U S defense secretary at NATO today may not aim to have Ukraine as [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=328.8s)]
*  this is the difference between Donald Trump also undermining us aid. Okay. Yeah. I should stay [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=335.6s)]
*  neutral. Like Asmongold. I should stay neutral in politics like Asmongold, which would require me to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=342.24s)]
*  just watch Donald Trump and go, yeah, that's pretty based. Yeah. Anyway, you should just tell [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=348.08s)]
*  people you are a centrist while holding all the same views. Yeah, I am. I'm a, I'm a centrist. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=354.88s)]
*  I'm a neutralist. I'm just objective. But something that a lot of people fail to, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  something that a lot of people fail to consider here is that the situation in Ukraine is not [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  at this stage, the situation in Ukraine and what will happen in Ukraine is dictated by the terms [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=374.4s)]
*  of the battlefield. Okay. As in there's two different options here. Will Ukrainian conscripts [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=379.11999999999995s)]
*  will Ukrainians living outside of Ukraine right now, Ukrainian men living outside of Ukraine right [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  now be forcibly deported back to Ukraine in order to be conscripted into the military and basically [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=392.4s)]
*  reinvigorate the Ukrainian defense forces because they need manpower more than anything else. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=400.16s)]
*  Or will there be a, will there be a land swap agreement and inevitable end or an inevitable [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=408.16s)]
*  cessation of hostilities? Okay. You can criticize the democratic party without also blaming all of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=419.36s)]
*  Trump's ridiculous things on them as well. I'm not, I'm not blaming what Trump is saying right [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=425.12s)]
*  now. This is not even a criticism of the democratic party. This is a criticism of American foreign [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=429.76s)]
*  policy. Okay. You don't believe the billions from the U S government had a significant effect on [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=435.04s)]
*  Ukraine defending itself from invasion. No, of course it did. It probably stopped it. Not even [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=439.2s)]
*  probably. It definitely stopped Vladimir Putin from taking Kiev. Okay. 100%. It played a pretty [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=444.16s)]
*  major role, especially in the interim from 2014 word where Ukraine was able to build a standing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=451.52s)]
*  military played a very significant role in them stopping Russia's offensive campaign. I think it [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  definitely played a role. Having said that, however, having said that, however, after that fact, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=466.88s)]
*  there was one instance where they talked in Antalya on a 15 point plan that fell apart [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=474.4s)]
*  and ever since then Russia was Russia has been able to take more and more space in Eastern Ukraine, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=480.8s)]
*  move up Eastern Ukrainian positions, annex key parts of Eastern Ukraine in sham symbolic [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=488.8s)]
*  annexations and like ridiculous elections that they're holding. Okay. While simultaneously [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=497.52s)]
*  destroying Ukrainian farmland, mining the shit out of Eastern Ukraine and hardening their positions [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=503.36s)]
*  I thought you were pro-Russia. No, no, I'm not pro-Russia. Why would you think I'm pro-Russia? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=510.8s)]
*  I've never been pro-Russia. Please stop relying on drama content creators who have no understanding [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=515.2s)]
*  of politics whatsoever. Okay. Jesus Christ. I can't believe we're three years into this [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  and people still come in here. Can't believe Hasan is not pro-Russia. That's so shocking to me. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=530.4s)]
*  I thought he was how, how hard is this position hardened by a democracy today? And what find [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=535.28s)]
*  outside of black pill to go. I don't know what you're saying. Okay. You're a communist potato, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=541.68s)]
*  potato. Yeah, exactly. Because of my communist background, I am of course in support of the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=546.96s)]
*  communist kleptocracy. That is modern Russia. Certainly, certainly a communist country, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=553.68s)]
*  certainly a socialist country led by the Marxist Leninist Vladimir Putin, famous communist. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=561.04s)]
*  Anyway, I don't think that there is a tremendous difference. I don't think there is a gigantic [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  difference between what the, what any administration would do in this process. The only difference [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=579.36s)]
*  here is that Donald Trump will again say the quiet part out loud and defend it, even though [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=585.76s)]
*  it is indefensible, but that is because American foreign policy is often indefensible. The aesthetic [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=592.0s)]
*  differences are identical to the USAID gutting. Okay. Now Donald Trump says he's going to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=598.56s)]
*  completely undermine USAID. In which case is he actually going to stop clandestine operations [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  overseas or stop sending aid to other countries? Yes, he will most likely stop key aspects of aid [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=611.68s)]
*  going into other countries. But in reality, they are most likely going to centralize USAID [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=620.4s)]
*  and still continue USAID style operations. It's just that America is responding to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=625.76s)]
*  its standing around the world changing. Okay. As the global hegemonic superpower, as the cop, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=634.16s)]
*  as the universal police force of the planet, America has lost a lot of soft power capabilities [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=640.96s)]
*  and Donald Trump is accelerating that, accelerating that change to all hard power, all military, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=648.48s)]
*  all stick, no carrot. That's it. Okay. I think this is, I think this is a genuinely dangerous [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=656.1600000000001s)]
*  change. Can you explain what soft power versus hard power means? Yes. Soft power is when you do [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=664.08s)]
*  nice things for other countries and therefore garner goodwill. I'll give you an example from [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=668.72s)]
*  China. China sending Cinevac to the Philippines is an example of soft power. Okay. Soft power [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=674.72s)]
*  works hand in hand with American military might and American military capabilities. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=682.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay. It's the carrot versus the stick. The carrot plays a pretty big role because it causes, or at [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=689.76s)]
*  least it creates an environment where 800 military bases all around the world in foreign countries [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=697.44s)]
*  is not seen as 800 separate American military invasions, but rather a security cooperation [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=704.24s)]
*  and a security partnership. The Ukraine Russia line has mostly been fixed since 2022 to 2023. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=711.2800000000001s)]
*  Russia gained 4,000 kilometers, a kilometer square kilometers of territory in 2024, which was largely [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=716.4000000000001s)]
*  meaningless. So it's currently a stalemate and enormous cost to both sides. Of course [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=723.84s)]
*  Russia gained 4,000 square kilometers of Ukraine in 2024. How many soldiers did it lose? Verifying [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=729.2s)]
*  casualty figures for soldiers in Russia, Ukraine, war is difficult as experts call it a war of [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=734.32s)]
*  narratives. What is clear Russia has lost more troops than in any war since world war two. Yeah, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=737.6s)]
*  it is endlessly costly for Russia to consistently engage in permanent war in Ukraine. And it is, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=742.64s)]
*  of course, also endlessly costly for Ukraine. The problem between Russia and Ukraine is that [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=752.16s)]
*  while Ukraine is backed by the entirety of the Western world, they simply have less people. No, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  they're not saying that they've lost close to the same number of troops in world war two. They're [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=765.36s)]
*  not saying that. They're just simply saying that the number of casualties on the Russian side are [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=771.52s)]
*  ginormous more than any other country since world war two. World war two was like 20 million [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=777.2800000000001s)]
*  people. That's obviously it's nowhere near that. Okay. Doge is already dismantling the NED. This [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=785.2s)]
*  is good for the global South as a whole. We do not want your color revolution says top G. Yeah. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=790.48s)]
*  Once again, I think the difference between what America will do in the future versus what America [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=797.2800000000001s)]
*  has done for the past almost century is that they just won't try to they just won't try to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=803.28s)]
*  masquerade what they're doing as like a good thing. Okay. A thing that everybody wanted only [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  when you witnessed the unstoppable march of 1.4 billion patriotic volunteers. Will you finally [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=816.0s)]
*  wake up from the pitiful stupor forced upon you by living in the imperial core, but a fake socialist [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  like you will never visit China. You will remain an ostrich with his very small head buried in the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  sand. First of all, don't threaten me with a good time. Okay. Don't threaten me with a very, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=830.24s)]
*  even though you are, you know, making fun of my head size, which is something outside of my control [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=837.28s)]
*  and only a consequence of my very broad shoulders, which I believe in most Asian countries is seen as [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=842.32s)]
*  a positive anyway. Don't know if it's the same in China as well. Okay. But all you are doing is, is [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=847.92s)]
*  highlighting that I will benefit from the Chinese century of prosperity. Okay. That's all you're [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=855.52s)]
*  saying anyway. If given the chance, would you visit China? I really want to, I want to visit [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=862.4s)]
*  China this year. Not exactly sure when I would do it, but I do want to do it. That is a certainty. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=867.8399999999999s)]
*  You're a smart guard. You really think Kamala would have pushed for a ceasefire in Ukraine. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=873.8399999999999s)]
*  Biden's deal was muscular liberalism and Kamala was about preserving his legacy. I think muscular [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=876.64s)]
*  liberalism aside, the only thing that would be different is the aesthetics and how it is presented [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=882.0s)]
*  because once again, and I repeat this position over and over again, and I think I will have to [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=887.76s)]
*  repeat it over and over again. The only difference would be how it is packaged because the situation [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=892.8s)]
*  in Ukraine is not dictated by simply just like American interests or Russian interests. It is [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=899.52s)]
*  more so dictated by the terms of the battlefield. And if Ukraine is simply running out of manpower, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=906.0s)]
*  as I've reported over and over again, over the course of the past couple of months, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=911.44s)]
*  and as the appetite towards more war is waning, regardless of the moral position [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=915.2800000000001s)]
*  that many Ukrainians maintain in emancipation from Russian invasion. Okay. At the end of the day, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=922.96s)]
*  there's a desperation that sets in when you simply don't have enough manpower. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=933.44s)]
*  So unless you send in American mercenaries or something by the tens of thousands beyond the [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=941.44s)]
*  foreign Legion, okay. And try to change the dynamic of this, try to change the dynamic of this battle [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=949.9200000000001s)]
*  with no severe Russian response, no like nuclear Russian response or whatever. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=959.12s)]
*  Running out of manpower is such an AI way to say such a grim thing. Yes, running out of manpower [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=965.6s)]
*  means Ukrainians are dying. Okay. That's it. That's what that means. I think the reason the [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=970.96s)]
*  US is letting go of its soft power is because US is now unable to use access to the dollar and [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=976.08s)]
*  Western markets to control governments. China is a far better market and they do better deals. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=980.48s)]
*  Washington knows it's not the global hegemon. I'm afraid they will try to start a world war to stop [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=983.84s)]
*  China's growth. They just know trading isn't working anymore. Where is the sentiment that [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=988.72s)]
*  Ukraine is lost though? I mean, this is not a sentiment. This is just a grim, but realistic [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=992.4s)]
*  analysis of what the situation looks like in terms of Ukrainian manpower. That's why I keep repeating [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1000.48s)]
*  that there are millions of Ukrainian men that no longer live in Ukraine that got refugee status in [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1006.9599999999999s)]
*  the West. What do you do in that situation? Do you forcibly extract them and then force them back to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1012.88s)]
*  go and pick up arms against Russia? Do you deport Ukrainian men from all of the Western nations that [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1020.72s)]
*  they went to? Okay. And then force them to serve in the Ukrainian defense forces because that's the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1028.96s)]
*  only way at this point that or conscription for all Ukrainian men down to the age of 18 [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1036.48s)]
*  is the only way that you can maintain this posture, this defensive posture, or do you [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1043.92s)]
*  tell Ukraine that it's basically over Russia being this despotic authoritarian nation that it is and [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1051.6000000000001s)]
*  being significantly larger than Ukraine has the capacity to keep pushing men to the front lines [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  in a way that Ukraine can't keep up. That's it. Russia just has more people at the end of the day. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1069.52s)]
*  Wars are fought on the boundaries of attrition and Russia has more manpower to lose. They're [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1076.16s)]
*  not even using their own people. They're using North Koreans. Now I think that's more so [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1082.56s)]
*  aesthetic partnership with North Korea saying like North Korea also has a say in this or North Korea [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1086.8s)]
*  also is involved in this. Are they using North Koreans? Yes. Is it possible? Is it partially [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1092.88s)]
*  because they've run out a lot of they've run out of a lot of manpower? Certainly. But it's not like [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1097.76s)]
*  a game changer for Russia at all. I think anyway, honestly, Ukraine has to convert into an attrition, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1104.8799999999999s)]
*  anti-occupation, guerrilla war, open field wars will always be in Russia's favor. Give them [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1110.64s)]
*  territory, then give them hell. I mean, as a Ukrainian, I can confirm your point that Ukraine [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1114.48s)]
*  has no more men, but from here to say that Ukraine has lost, it seems to me a somewhat pessimistic [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1118.8s)]
*  vision. However, the Ukrainians will not give into Russia's demands if they do not at least [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1124.0s)]
*  concede something to Ukraine. I think the general feeling is better to all died and to surrender [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1127.84s)]
*  in terms of loss overall, I think. I think that both sides have lost a lot in this process, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1132.96s)]
*  for sure. Like Ukraine has had, I guess somewhat of a of a Pyrrhic victory, a Pyrrhic victory [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1140.56s)]
*  in terms of being able to stop the Russian forces. And there are, there's a tremendous number of [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1149.1200000000001s)]
*  Russian combatants that have been slaughtered in the process as well. The problem there is [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1158.32s)]
*  when you when one side just has less people, what are you supposed to do? Is there actually any proof [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1164.88s)]
*  that there are DPRK soldiers in Ukraine? All I've seen an article citing the Ukrainian and South [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1170.08s)]
*  Korean intelligence. I think that even the Russian side is admitted to using or like all [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1174.16s)]
*  the reporting says that they're using it inside of Russian territory in terms of like internal [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1181.3600000000001s)]
*  defense in Kursk and whatnot. Some of it is like Asian Russians, which exist, but they have they [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1187.04s)]
*  have captured some DPRK forces from what I understand. I don't know if they're in the front [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1195.44s)]
*  lines on Ukrainian territory, but I've seen some videos even on Russian hospitals about [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1200.8s)]
*  like Russian combatants in hospital, chilling with the with the what they claim are North Koreans. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1206.88s)]
*  But then again, as this Al Jazeera article shows, it is a war of narratives. Not that it ultimately [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1214.96s)]
*  matters because once again, it's not it's not like a significant difference maker. It's more like I [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1221.6000000000001s)]
*  would go so far as to say that getting artillery shells from DPRK for Russia was more significant [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1230.48s)]
*  in this in this conflict than the actual troops. Because I think a lot of people on the pro-NATO [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1238.72s)]
*  pro-Ukraine side look to that and say, oh, it's because like Russia has incurred tremendous loss, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1247.44s)]
*  which is true. They have without matching that up against what the current Ukrainian defense [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1252.4s)]
*  forces look like. I think it's more so just a partnership that Russia has with the DPRK [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1258.8s)]
*  and reaffirmation of said partnership than anything else. There's a lot of FPV drone footage [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1266.48s)]
*  showing a lot of Asian combatants. I know, but Russian forces also have a lot of minority [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1274.08s)]
*  populations in Russia. There's ethnic Russians that are still Asian. So drone footage doesn't [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1279.36s)]
*  necessarily show that they're definitely North Korean. Not saying that there aren't, by the way. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1286.8s)]
*  Most of Russia is in Asia. So like Asian is in like East Asian, like dudes who look like [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1292.0s)]
*  dudes who look like they could be North Korean. Russian someday, but the very idea is an [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1299.9199999999998s)]
*  anathema to talk about the indigenous populations like Tuans, Caucasus, Budiats, etc. Yes, everyone [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  else in the room. There is no betrayal there. There is a recognition that the whole world and [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1312.16s)]
*  the United States is invested and interested in peace, a negotiated peace, as President Trump has [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1318.4s)]
*  said, stopping the killing. And so that will require both sides recognizing things they don't [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1325.1200000000001s)]
*  want to. That's why I think the world is fortunate to have President Trump. Only he at this moment [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1331.1200000000001s)]
*  could convene the powers that be to bring peace. But the Europeans fear a Trump-Putin stitch up, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1336.72s)]
*  which freezes both them and the Ukrainians out of any peace talks. For the EU's top diplomat, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1344.0s)]
*  who comes from Estonia, a former Soviet state that fears the same fate as Ukraine, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1350.08s)]
*  it's existential. It is clear that Estonia mentioned, Estonia mentioned Pog. Any deal [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1355.84s)]
*  behind our backs will not work. Any agreement will need also Ukraine and Europe being part of it. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1362.8799999999999s)]
*  And this is clear that appeasement also always, always fails. So Ukraine will continue to resist [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1371.84s)]
*  and Europe will continue to back Ukraine. Britain, which sometimes hovers between the US and Europe, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1380.48s)]
*  is clearly in the European camp. There can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1388.48s)]
*  And Ukraine's voice must be at the heart of any talks. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1394.56s)]
*  Some might recall a meeting exactly 80 years ago when the Soviet, British and American leaders, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1401.44s)]
*  Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt, met at Yalta in Crimea to carve up the world after World War Two. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1407.92s)]
*  War ravaged occupied countries had no... [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1414.72s)]
*  What's your favorite Houthi musical? What's your favorite bar from a Houthi musical? Play a Houthi [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1418.32s)]
*  musical for chat. It would probably be that, it would probably be the one that I showed Nick, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  where they were talking about how American-backed Saudi coalition forces were doing a genocide in [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1430.56s)]
*  Yemen. And they were saying, send us more weapons if you want, we will never stand down. That one [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1436.08s)]
*  probably was, is my favorite. Yeah. Yeah. They got disstracks for days. I don't know why people [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1443.04s)]
*  think that this is like a massive own or something, especially considering that, especially considering [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1448.72s)]
*  that this is like not a issue to be hosted on any other platform with the exception of Twitch's own [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1456.1599999999999s)]
*  terms of service being way more rigid than all these other platforms. You know, this is not a [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1466.0s)]
*  defense of the Ansar Allah movement's banner or their domestic affairs, but yeah, if you, if you [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1471.04s)]
*  genuinely want to know, I think that the one where they were fighting against the Saudi blockade and [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1479.84s)]
*  the famine and said, you can keep killing our people. It doesn't matter. That one was a pretty [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  good one. You've been cutting your oil with whiskey. Oh, South for Saudi Arabia. If chatter is [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1492.8799999999999s)]

*  work. It came off. Like he's saying you're a fake fan named three Huthi songs. Yeah. You're not a [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1503.6s)]

*  And that's how the new U S administration sees it too. We can talk all we want about values. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1519.6s)]
*  Values are important, but you can't shoot values. You can't shoot flags and you can't shoot strong [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1526.0s)]
*  speeches. Wow. Bold. There is no replacement for hard power. He's, he's really spitting [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1536.32s)]
*  Ukrainian soldiers on the front line. I'm thinking about history for them. It's about [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1546.4s)]
*  personal survival and the survival of their country. Because if Ukraine is sacrificed to Russia, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1551.52s)]
*  what was the point? Why did their comrades die? The atrocities Russian soldiers committed him. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1557.2s)]
*  It's a great question. I agree. A question that I have wondered quite a bit myself. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1563.2s)]
*  Boucher. Will they be not punished but rewarded for them? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1570.8s)]
*  The [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1574.56s)]
*  Ukrainian cities are still being bombarded. They desperately need peace, as president Trump says, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1576.56s)]
*  but not at the cost of losing their independence or reaching a temporary peace only for Russia to [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1582.72s)]
*  come back for more in a few years time. The NATO family photo, but the family is divided. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1589.2s)]
*  Europe, the Americans have made clear has to increase military spending and they can [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1597.2s)]
*  defend Ukraine if they like America isn't going to the post-world war two order is over. Get used [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1602.24s)]
*  to it. Even the red army use soft power to fight the nationalists in China by promising things and [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1609.84s)]
*  giving things to peasants. Yeah. I mean, it was fairly easy considering that the KMT's vision for [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1614.24s)]
*  a new China was to reassert and reinstall the previous landlord ship dominance over the peasant [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1622.08s)]
*  class. Whereas for the red army, it was a complete restructuring of said hierarchy. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1630.08s)]
*  So, you know, even the peasants that worked alongside the KMT initially, or filled the ranks [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1637.4399999999998s)]
*  of the KMT initially were like, okay, well, I don't want to fucking landlord. I'm going to [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1643.1999999999998s)]
*  go with the other guys. So yeah, I don't even know if that's soft power at that point versus a [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1646.48s)]
*  genuine commitment to instilling change. Shanghai shack was anti-landlord. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1655.3600000000001s)]
*  Maybe initially. No, I mean, there is, there is truth to the KMT's initial formation looking [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1662.5600000000002s)]
*  somewhat similar to, well, I mean, I wouldn't say similar to communism or anything like that, but [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1670.5600000000002s)]
*  like, yeah, at first the nationalist movement was also a movement of change [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1676.48s)]
*  moving away from colonial domination and reasserting. Remember nationalist movements [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1683.28s)]
*  at this time, at this period, especially if they were colonial subjects were liberatory movements. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1692.08s)]
*  So it, the, the, the attitude presented or even the, the initial reception is going to be different. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1698.96s)]
*  Anyway, Lindsay Hillson reporting that whatever. Thank you for voting for Trump. We needed change. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1706.96s)]
*  Yeah, dude. I'm sure you think I voted for Donald Trump. Come on. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1712.56s)]
*  He seems to deliver another black. Thank you for the raid. Hope you had a good stream. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1716.8799999999999s)]
*  The Trump white house. Let's get more from our Washington correspondent, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1722.72s)]
*  Siobhan Kennedy Siobhan. And we're no bombshell. Who the banner being an issue is literally [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1726.08s)]
*  diluted Western moral panic. Palestinians in Yemen is living under occupation. Genocide can't be [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1730.24s)]
*  anti-Semitic. The Israelis, maybe only the other Jewish Palestinians in Yemen, but not to their [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1734.1599999999999s)]
*  oppressors. Like slaves can't be raised as slave owners. I think regardless of, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1737.44s)]
*  regardless of the ways in which it, the, like, I think Norm Finkelstein has a really good peg on [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1742.64s)]
*  this and I stand by his analysis on the issue, but it still doesn't change the banner being a [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1751.2s)]
*  curse upon the Jews. You know what I mean? And it's funny to say this because I suspect that they [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1759.3600000000001s)]
*  will most likely change it regardless. Just like the, just like the Hamas charter changed as well. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1764.48s)]
*  Like, yes, on that side of the world, a Jew and Zionism is a substitute for one another because of [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1770.64s)]
*  their experiences with Israel, Israel masquerading as a Jewish force and doing this for Judaism. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1779.1200000000001s)]
*  Having said that the, the, considering that the Hamas charter also changed in an effort to be [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1785.52s)]
*  more modern in an effort to, to be broadly received as an emancipatory force rather than like a [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1795.1200000000001s)]
*  terror cell, which of course that didn't really happen. But I think that that will be, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1802.0s)]
*  that will be a similar situation with like the Ansar Allah movement as well. Now, of course, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1809.1200000000001s)]
*  they would, the Ansar Allah movement would have probably had an easier time talking about normalized [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1817.3600000000001s)]
*  relations with the Western world in the initial steps of the Biden administration as Biden moved [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1824.24s)]
*  to take them off the terror list, which he did only to put them back on the terror list [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1831.04s)]
*  when Operation Prosperity Guardians started, you know, it's probably not going to happen anytime [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1836.48s)]
*  soon. I don't know why we're talking about this though. Yeah, Matt, but it was interesting last [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1842.24s)]
*  night, Donald Trump in the White House was asked on multiple occasions if his peace talks with [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1848.56s)]
*  Putin would include Ukraine. And I have to say he was noncommitting. Even if you rewrite the [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1854.32s)]
*  definition of racism like that, it's still prejudiced and wrong. What? No, anyone can be [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1858.96s)]
*  anti-Semitic. My God. I don't disagree with you, chatter. I understand, but you're doing a, you're [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1864.1599999999999s)]
*  doing an anti-white racism is real argument right now, which is weird. Like the fuck. And also there's [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1871.52s)]
*  never been a moment where I've defended the, the Ansar Allah banner anyway. That's not the point. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1878.0s)]
*  I do think it's indefensible and not just from like the Western perspective, but if you want to [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1883.04s)]
*  understand the context in which these sorts of opinions manifest, I will also explain that to [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1888.4s)]
*  you as well. All right. Can we just continue with this conversation? Middle at best at one point, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1896.48s)]
*  a journalist pressed him on the matter. Do you view Ukraine? He was asked as an equal partner [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1902.48s)]
*  in the peace process. The president looked stumped. It was as if he hadn't thought about that question. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1908.48s)]
*  You know, that's an interesting question, he said after musing for a while. I think they have to [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1915.1200000000001s)]
*  make peace, President Trump said. That was not a good war to go into. No sense from President Trump [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1920.5600000000002s)]
*  that Ukraine had no choice, that it was attacked by Russia. He was also asked at one point whether [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1927.9199999999998s)]
*  or not Ukraine would have to cede territory to make peace. And he said that Zelensky is going [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1933.04s)]
*  to have to do what he's going to have to do. And then at one point he said, yeah, I think they're [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1940.4799999999998s)]
*  going to get some of the land back. I think they will. Well, I was up on the hill earlier trying [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1944.7199999999998s)]
*  to gauge reaction from senators as to the developments. As you could imagine, the Democrats [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1950.0s)]
*  are furious while the Republicans were torn between trying to be supportive of Ukraine and [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1956.24s)]
*  trying to be deferential to President Trump. Let's hear what some of them had to say. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1962.4s)]
*  Is America betraying Ukraine? President Trump, not America. Please make some distinction between [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1968.88s)]
*  the two. Secretary Hegseth has apparently said in a meeting that the door for Ukraine to be admitted [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1975.84s)]
*  to NATO is closed and that they will not be able to recover their sovereign territory. If you go [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1984.0s)]
*  back and read Donald Trump's art of the deal, you don't give up the most important negotiating [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1989.3600000000001s)]
*  points before you begin negotiations in earnest. For us to concede those as a country, for the Trump [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=1995.3600000000001s)]
*  administration to concede those, would be a betrayal of the thousands of Ukrainians who have fought so [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2001.6000000000001s)]
*  bravely and died for their country's freedom. But what about the concessions? Europe is saying, why [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2006.96s)]
*  give up things before you've even started the negotiation? That's a betrayal. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2011.36s)]
*  In my conversations with President Trump, he wants Russia to lose, he wants Ukraine to win, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2014.8799999999999s)]
*  and he wants the war to end. So I know he's working hard to make that happen. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2019.04s)]
*  So the negotiations will definitely include Ukraine at their heart. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2021.76s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I believe that. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2026.56s)]
*  Okay. Like, why would you even believe any of that, by the way? It's so, it's like, are the [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2030.4799999999998s)]
*  conversations featuring Palestinians and their needs? No. Are the conversations featuring the [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2037.84s)]
*  conversations never feature the people that are outside of the American, the, the American [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2045.28s)]
*  allegiances. Okay. They just don't care. I think it's crazy to think that like to act like what [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2054.96s)]
*  Trump says and what Trump does are directly in line with one another. I think it's silly to assume [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2062.24s)]
*  that they're going to give a shit about Ukrainians at all and what their actual opinions are, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2068.64s)]
*  or what their actual needs are. It never was the case. And I think that there is some, some cold [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2075.2s)]
*  hearted truths to the way that Trump is operating, as is the case with many of the things that he [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2081.68s)]
*  says when it comes to American foreign policy, something that I think I will have to repeat over [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2088.32s)]
*  and over and over and over again, as I did the first Trump administration, it's not correct. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2093.76s)]
*  It's immoral, but it's the truth about American foreign policy. The only difference is it's [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2101.1200000000003s)]
*  stripped of the aesthetic reasons. It's stripped of the, the aesthetic permission structure that [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2107.92s)]
*  it creates for liberals. That's it. The greatest example that I use to this day is when Donald [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2114.56s)]
*  Trump turns around, when Donald Trump famously turned around and said, yeah, of course we're [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2121.84s)]
*  going to keep giving billions of dollars of weapons to Saudi Arabia. Who's going to buy the weapons? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2126.16s)]
*  Are you, do you have a billion dollars? Of course I'm going to keep giving Saudi Arabia weapons at [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2131.44s)]
*  the time Saudi Arabia was doing a genocide in Yemen. Many of you probably didn't know that, but [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2135.36s)]
*  at least the Hassan Abiy heads in here that have been around for a while, we're familiar with this. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2141.04s)]
*  That is, that is the, that is the, the position of the American [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2146.0s)]
*  state department. The only difference is there's no need to shelter the American public from the [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2153.36s)]
*  truth. He's just openly stating what it is. What is the case that Ukraine can win, that it can push [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2158.16s)]
*  back to regain territory. But the message yesterday was you don't have the United States. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2166.0s)]
*  The message yesterday was weak and pathetic, kowtowing to Putin, bowing and scraping. President [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2172.8s)]
*  Trump seems to be an admirer of Vladimir Putin, which is a nice way to put it. Is America still [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2179.6800000000003s)]
*  supporting Ukraine? Senator Van Hollen, I'm glad to answer your question. Do you support Ukraine still? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2187.36s)]
*  I do. Well, I certainly do. I'm very worried about what happens. Does America support Ukraine still? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2193.12s)]
*  I've said it was a mistake from the beginning to send $200 billion to Ukraine. I'm still opposed [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2201.2s)]
*  to sending more aid to Ukraine. Well, he's like, I've never been a supporter of the Ukraine. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2206.24s)]
*  Why are you asking me that? Last thing, President Trump reiterated that he does plan to meet [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2214.3199999999997s)]
*  Putin in Saudi Arabia. He said that Putin would also come here to Washington, DC and that he would [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2219.6s)]
*  go there to Moscow. He was asked at one point whether or not he would meet Zelensky. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2225.2s)]
*  I think my most controversial opinion on this is that kind of not dissimilar to what I've said [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2230.3199999999997s)]
*  about the Biden administration, knowing full well that the Trump administration was going to take [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2236.4s)]
*  the reins or even the danger of the Trump administration coming back into power. The Biden [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2241.04s)]
*  camp should have packed all of this shit up. They should have packed it up in their own vision if [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2246.88s)]
*  they chose to do so, whether it be with Israel or whether it be with the Obama administration, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2251.12s)]
*  the first time around, ensuring that they put a Supreme Court appointment up there, no matter what [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2257.36s)]
*  the cost, considering that there was a likelihood that Trump might actually win and then do whatever [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2263.12s)]
*  he wants with the Supreme Court. Major mistake from the Democratic Party, major issue with oversight. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2267.6s)]
*  So even if you're a Dem, even if you're a NatSec Dem, I certainly am not. But let's say there are [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2273.52s)]
*  some national security Democrats out there. There's plenty of pro-NATO Democrats out there. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2281.36s)]
*  There's plenty of NatSec Dems out there. How do you look at this? How do you look at the situation [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2287.36s)]
*  and think, well, the Biden administration probably should have packed all of this stuff up [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2294.8s)]
*  to ensure that the Trump administration couldn't come in and actually seize the reins of power [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2301.92s)]
*  and deal with it in the way that they want to. That's it. Same with Ukraine, same with Gaza, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2308.08s)]
*  especially with Gaza, because there is a lot more power and influence that we have over Israel [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2317.52s)]
*  as opposed to power and influence that we have over Vladimir Putin, a foreign adversary with [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2323.92s)]
*  his own needs, own material needs and violent ambitions. That's it. That's my statement. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2329.52s)]
*  So if you're here upset about Donald Trump assuming the role of assuming control over all [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2335.92s)]
*  of this foreign policy initiatives, remember that this only happened as a direct consequence of the [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2341.68s)]
*  Biden camp not actually doing what was necessary at the time when they had three years to change [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2350.0s)]
*  the dynamic, whether it be offering more weapons faster or directly meeting Russia and coming to [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2356.72s)]
*  the table and trying to facilitate some kind of ceasefire negotiation. Whether you believe that [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2365.7599999999998s)]
*  Russia will keep up their end of the bargain or not does not matter because instead you just had [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2372.3199999999997s)]
*  no ceasefire and all war. Putin is going to reject the deal. I doubt it. I think that he has also [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2377.04s)]
*  incurred significant penalties, significant losses. So it is in his best interest as well to try and [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2383.12s)]
*  pack the situation up and solidify the boundaries of all of the territory that he annexed. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2391.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that one of the, one of the most, one of the biggest oversights in the Biden camp [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2397.8399999999997s)]
*  from my perspective was consistently saying, Oh, we're not going to have, we're not going to talk [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2407.2s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin. We're just not going to do that, which was a lie. They did talk to Vladimir Putin. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2412.16s)]
*  They talked to Russian envoys when there was a hostage negotiation at play, but they never [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2416.3999999999996s)]
*  talked to any sort of Russian envoys when it came down to facilitating a ceasefire. I think that was [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2421.92s)]
*  a major oversight from the democratic party once again. In Ukraine, again, he looked puzzles and he [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2429.44s)]
*  said, well, I might, he wouldn't commit to that. Matt. What is the power in Washington? Thanks very [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2435.2s)]
*  much indeed. Let's go to Christian London. Well, joining me now is Timothy Milovanov, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2440.72s)]
*  Ukraine's former economy minister and president of the Kyiv school of economics. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2445.4399999999996s)]
*  That could have happened only before the elections and maybe even before Brandon dropped out. No, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2451.04s)]
*  that's what I'm saying. No, that's precisely what I'm saying. That is what I mean. Yes. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2454.72s)]
*  There, that's why I said there were three years where the, the Biden camp could have actually, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2459.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, what's ironic if the Biden camp actually went in and said, no, we got to talk to the [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2465.12s)]
*  Russians. I suspect that the statement, the, the attitude from Fox news and the Republican [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2469.68s)]
*  right would most likely be fuck these guys. They're doing Obama style, uh, apology a tour for an, uh, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2476.16s)]
*  for an enemy of America, regardless of what Trump's rhetoric around this issue has been, except, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2482.72s)]
*  you know, they didn't do that anyway. So here we are anyway, this is still could have, would have [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2489.6s)]
*  should have, uh, and, um, there's a lot of that, but it doesn't matter. So why do the Dems need to [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2494.24s)]
*  be nice? What do you mean need to be nice? I'm simply stating that if the Democrats had a [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2499.52s)]
*  different vision for Ukraine and how it should, uh, how it should be, uh, how it should basically [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2504.9599999999996s)]
*  end, then they should have implemented it, or at least tried to implement it. I suspect that they [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2511.6s)]
*  don't have that much of a different vision from the Trump cabinet regardless, because American [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2517.2s)]
*  foreign policy is uniparty. Uh, and the marginal differences from the Republican administration, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2522.4s)]
*  the democratic one is that the Republican administration has a different way, especially [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2528.1600000000003s)]
*  with Trump has a different way of pushing their agenda. And they oftentimes will go further, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2534.0s)]
*  right. And become more reactionary and, uh, and, and fuck things up even further and get more [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2540.08s)]
*  violent, regardless of what they say they're interested in doing. The only way that, uh, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2546.4s)]
*  any kind of conflict ends is if it's, if it's an inevitability due to the conditions of the [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2552.08s)]
*  battlefield. Afghanistan withdrawal is a great example of this as well. Negotiated by Donald [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2559.44s)]
*  Trump implemented by Joe Biden, Donald Trump turned around and shit all over Joe Biden, see, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2565.44s)]
*  uh, Joe Biden, uh, pulling out of Afghanistan while following the conditions set forth by [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2569.36s)]
*  the Trump administration. Why did we pull out of Afghanistan? It got to a point where it was just [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2574.08s)]
*  costly for no reason. Ukraine could say no to what's ever Donald Trump agrees with Vladimir Putin. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2579.6s)]
*  Well, there are minimal conditions for peace, uh, on Ukraine's side. One of them is not [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2586.96s)]
*  ceding more territory unoccupied. Um, second one is some meaningful, um, um, guarantees, security [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2592.24s)]
*  guarantees because if those are not there, um, what is there to negotiate or agree to, you know, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2600.24s)]
*  just accept, uh, Russian conditions. Yeah, this is the most Ukrainian man alive is what someone [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2607.2s)]
*  said in the chat. And I agree. His name is Tim Wolf, Eve. So something, you know, for Ukraine [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2613.3599999999997s)]
*  to sacrifice, uh, to make painful sacrifices, whatever they are. Um, I think it is important [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2619.52s)]
*  that Ukraine gets something back and, uh, Ukraine is an independent country. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2625.92s)]
*  So it could say no. I mean, um, you know, the, the U S defense secretary is saying effectively [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2630.48s)]
*  Europe has to be the security guarantor for Ukraine. Now this just comes a couple of days [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2636.96s)]
*  after president Zelensky said, well, that's just impossible. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2642.16s)]
*  Well, yes, indeed. Um, president Zelensky said, and I think that's true, um, that, um, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2646.96s)]
*  full security guarantees, uh, real security guarantees, which prevent Russia from invading [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2653.4399999999996s)]
*  in a couple of years again, I impossible without the United States being there, Europe can provide [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2658.08s)]
*  what 50, 70, 80% of all, uh, but that's, you know, the U S has to be there. Otherwise, uh, you know, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2663.9199999999996s)]
*  the war will restart or likely to restart soon. So yes, that's correct. And I think we have to [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2670.72s)]
*  bring the U S in some form. Do you think most Ukrainians will see this as a betrayal? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2676.24s)]
*  Oh, yes, absolutely. Most people see it as betrayal right now in Ukraine. Um, the U S cannot [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2680.48s)]
*  be relied on. And also president Trump appears to be very weak because he conceded to Russian [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2687.6s)]
*  demands before even getting anything out of it. So it looks like Putin has played president Trump. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2694.32s)]
*  At least that's how it is seen from Ukraine. It's also remarkable to hear politicians, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2700.72s)]
*  both in Europe and in Britain, comparing this to appeasement. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2704.96s)]
*  Oh yes, absolutely. I think it is appeasement. Um, you know, peace, uh, peace through strengths. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2710.56s)]
*  I haven't seen any strengths. No one has seen any. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2716.32s)]
*  I love when Asmongold supporters come in here and go, how is this guy not banned yet? One, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2719.28s)]
*  I don't even think Asmongold agrees with you in terms of getting me banned. I would be shocked [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2724.8s)]
*  if he did, but two, like, what do you mean? What do you want? He's already the largest [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2729.6s)]
*  commentator on the platform, a large political commentator on the platform. You just want [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2735.68s)]
*  like no dissent whatsoever. No dissent, no, no leftist position to ever be reflected on this. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2739.92s)]
*  Is that your argument? And if you're also not an Asmongold supporter and saying, how is this guy [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2748.7200000000003s)]
*  not banned? Then what is your expectation? Do you want Asmongold to be the only, uh, voice of [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2754.1600000000003s)]
*  politics on this platform? He already has, uh, developed quite the audience of right-wingers. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2761.28s)]
*  What happened? I thought you guys hated cancel culture saying you are a leftist is a massive [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2766.96s)]
*  stretch. Who is a real leftist in your estimation? You personally say you hate Democrats. God, I love, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2771.2s)]
*  I love doing political commentary. The anti-capitalist leftist, a democratic party [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2779.36s)]
*  in the United States of America as a, as a, as a person who is a critic of the democratic party [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2784.96s)]
*  for, uh, demanding that they do something, anything really. Um, I myself am of course, not a, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2791.8399999999997s)]
*  uh, real leftist real leftists are the pro-Kamala pro Biden coalition that is currently doing what? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2799.12s)]
*  Oh, I'm yelling at their base of support for demanding that they do things. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2809.12s)]
*  Respect pro Obama. I would say as a leftist, I'm hot. Andre, the Balkan, you are too stupid to [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2814.64s)]
*  navigate this type of conversation. Return to soccer talk and having a T shaped hairline, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2821.3599999999997s)]
*  American education. His name is Andre the Balkan. I don't think this is a, this is an American [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2826.56s)]
*  education chatter. I have a full head of here, man. Okay. The fact that he only responded to that [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2831.04s)]
*  means that he definitely has a T shape hairline respect. You can convert him here. He thinks [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2837.44s)]
*  the Democrats are leftist dude. Okay. I don't think I can convert him. He thinks Obama is a leftist [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2842.16s)]
*  strength. Um, people have seen weaknesses only in this negotiations, uh, so to speak negotiations, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2848.48s)]
*  quote unquote. So we'll see what brings what tomorrow brings. Maybe it's some kind of, uh, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2855.2s)]
*  very, uh, complicated and brilliant strategy to appease Putin in terms of rhetoric, but then in [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2860.72s)]
*  practice, uh, provide Ukraine with real security guarantees. I think this will become very clear [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2868.0s)]
*  very soon. But is there a realistic alternative to accepting whatever Trump negotiates, um, given how [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2873.92s)]
*  reliance Ukraine is on the United States to wage its war? I mean, you know, could Ukraine go back [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2881.52s)]
*  to war without America? Well, Ukraine in is in war right now and what, uh, you know, what the US is [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2888.48s)]
*  offering is basically nothing or Russia is offering. I'm actually not even convinced that [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2895.52s)]
*  Putin is willing to stop the war, um, or he's negotiating in any good face. Um, what is clear, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2900.56s)]
*  I think the fact of to everyone and presidents unless he has spoken about it, that getting [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2908.24s)]
*  territory back at this point is not really realistically that's to be done through some [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2912.88s)]
*  other measures in the future. Then NATO, frankly, even under the Biden administration that has not [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2917.28s)]
*  been on the table, I think here, president Trump and, um, um, um, secretary Higgins, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2923.12s)]
*  they basically say what Trump, uh, they say what the Biden administration has been saying behind [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2929.52s)]
*  the doors, but not publicly in the day. The US doesn't want to see Ukraine in NATO. So on that [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2934.96s)]
*  front, I think it is okay. It's just reality. The real question is, will there be, um, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2940.7999999999997s)]
*  what this guy might be? Wait, wait a minute. This guy might be a Russian operative who loves [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2945.7599999999998s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. I can't believe he said that. Wait a minute. This guy, but all of the, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2952.8s)]
*  all of the drama farmers have told me that anyone who says those things is a [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2962.7200000000003s)]
*  Vladimir Putin supporter like Hassan Hassanabi piker, who's the number one [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2969.36s)]
*  Vladimir Putin supporter of all time. It's interesting that the most Ukrainian men on [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2974.32s)]
*  the planet is also saying the exact same things that Vladimir Putin supporter Hassan Hassanabi [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2980.96s)]
*  piker is saying, Hmm, Hmm. Why didn't the us want Ukraine to be a part of NATO under Biden or Trump [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2987.36s)]
*  for the same exact reasons that France and Germany also didn't want to either. They had a, well, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=2995.28s)]
*  for America is different, but for European countries, they already had a longstanding [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3000.2400000000002s)]
*  energy. They had a longstanding energy partnership with Russia. They understood [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3004.32s)]
*  that this would be a red line that would be enforced by Russia. If Ukraine wants to be a [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3012.88s)]
*  part of NATO, like there is a, there is a level for global powers. There is a level of, of like [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3018.6400000000003s)]
*  how much they can enforce their will around the world. Like there's still obviously some, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3028.08s)]
*  some interests of foreign adversaries that they have to abide by. Like that's it. Minsk agreements. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3040.16s)]
*  No, no, that, that part doesn't really matter. Nobody ever fucking followed through on the [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3046.72s)]
*  Minsk agreements. People are so dumb, man. Why is asking the Ukrainians or the Palestinians, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3050.8s)]
*  what they would want be such a novel idea? That's never a point of consideration. Like that's never [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3054.88s)]
*  a point of consideration. That's not how, that's not how empire work. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3060.1600000000003s)]
*  Illiterate and financial support for Ukraine. Will there be American weapons? And will there be any [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3064.32s)]
*  kind of troops in some form, in whatever form to prevent Russia from invading in the future? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3070.88s)]
*  Exactly. I mean, if Ukraine were to reject a Trump offer of a deal and Trump pulled American weapons, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3076.7200000000003s)]
*  can the war go on from Ukraine's point of view? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3083.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it will. More people will die. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3088.16s)]
*  Trump is live with Modi by the way. And we'll get to that after this video is over. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3089.68s)]
*  I think Russia will make some gains, but those will be incremental. I don't think there is any [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3093.9199999999996s)]
*  chance Russia or Ukraine will make any major movements on the front because the nature of [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3098.8799999999997s)]
*  this war was this asymmetric technology was actually very cheap drones is that making large [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3105.6s)]
*  advancements are very, very difficult, close to impossible. So I think even at a very low support [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3111.68s)]
*  level from Europe, Ukraine will be able to resist, but Russia will be making advancements. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3118.8799999999997s)]
*  Mr. Milovanov, thank you very much indeed. Matt. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3126.56s)]
*  Well joining me now is Nina Khrushcheva, Professor of International Relations based in New York and [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3131.12s)]
*  the granddaughter of the former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. It's good to have you back [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3135.8399999999997s)]
*  on the program. Do you think that Vladimir Putin, given this olive branch from the Trump White House, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3139.92s)]
*  actually wants to end the war at the moment or do you think he's on a roll and wants to continue? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3147.12s)]
*  I think actually Putin is he can end the war if conditions are fine and it seems like now they're [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3154.16s)]
*  fine for him. He can end the war. He couldn't end this war if he's not a winner of it. He certainly [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3160.56s)]
*  could not be a loser, but now the winning can be presented because Trump called himself. Apparently [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3166.24s)]
*  we don't know exactly who requested the phone call, but it looks like it is it is Donald Trump. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3172.64s)]
*  She inherited his good looks. She looks exactly like him. Donald Trump was all complimentary [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3178.56s)]
*  talking about Putin and himself as we and then referring to Zelensky and potentially [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3183.2799999999997s)]
*  not necessarily very recent. That is the most Russian looking house I've ever done seen in my [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3189.84s)]
*  entire dang life. Respectable, respecting terms. So yes, I think I think he wouldn't mind if [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3195.76s)]
*  conditions are right for him. And for now they do look right, although there is a very long road, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3202.16s)]
*  as we all understand from the conversation to the actual ending of of this war. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3207.2000000000003s)]
*  And I mean, the Kremlin today actually, you know, tried to reassure Zelensky that he would be in [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3214.0s)]
*  involved in negotiations. And we heard similar sort of reassurances from the White House. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3219.28s)]
*  Are those reassurances to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans to be believed, do you think? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3224.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, I think Zelensky, I imagine I don't know what exactly they're talking about. But for Putin [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3231.52s)]
*  and Trump or for Trump and Putin, we don't know who is going to be the first in in this scenario. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3236.56s)]
*  If Zelensky behaves, that's fine. He can be there. But if Ukraine and actually in your previous [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3243.92s)]
*  pieces on the subject, it does say the West is going to stand with Ukraine for as long as it does. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3250.48s)]
*  But realistically, is if the United States withdraws, there is absolutely very little [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3256.3199999999997s)]
*  possibility that the war continues. Yes, it's going to be withstanding Russian's offenses, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3263.3599999999997s)]
*  but Russians are going to take more more territory. So they would not mind having [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3267.76s)]
*  not one picture on the wall. All mirrors is funny because it's like, like, it's an it's, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3273.0400000000004s)]
*  it's the only instance where there are so many mirrors that it actually has the opposite effect [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3278.96s)]
*  of what mirrors are supposed to do, which is make like the entire room larger, look larger, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3285.0400000000004s)]
*  feel larger. But because there are so many mirrors of various different sizes, it ends up making the [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3289.5200000000004s)]
*  room look smaller. Zelensky, but at the same time, we already heard Keith Kellogg saying that Ukraine [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3296.64s)]
*  needs elections. Is it a step to say that when we get to negotiations, it needs to be needs to be [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3304.16s)]
*  something else because the Lensky is to war, kind of war, president of peace. So do you think by [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3310.0s)]
*  calling for elections, they're kind of hoping that he would be voted out of office and someone [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3317.04s)]
*  more pliant might come in? I would imagine yes. I mean, I don't know what exactly they're thinking, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3321.04s)]
*  but I would imagine that, you know, if you insist on democracy, why are you not democratic? Why there [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3326.88s)]
*  is no why there is no elections? We even hear from Ukraine is that, you know, Ukrainians themselves [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3332.48s)]
*  are now kind of concerned about Zelensky legitimacy, not in ideological way, the way Russians presented, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3338.0s)]
*  but they themselves, I mean, because the war is not going to well, Zelensky promised that it will, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3343.92s)]
*  and now it didn't. And, you know, obviously, the president will be guilty. So yes, but I'm not sure [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3348.72s)]
*  we're impliable, but somebody who is realistic, somebody who can have a conversation with [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3353.52s)]
*  potentially the Ukraine ambassador in London. Right. I mean, the Europeans feel very kind of [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3358.08s)]
*  weakened by this. They feel as if they're the victims in this great power game, but they do [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3367.52s)]
*  have a card, don't they? They could fast forward Ukraine's EU membership, which is something that [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3371.2s)]
*  Vladimir Putin presumably would absolutely hate. Well, he actually the Russians said they wouldn't [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3376.32s)]
*  mind. I mean, I'm sure they mind it, but they really wouldn't mind because it's better than NATO. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3383.04s)]
*  Yes, they can fast forward the EU membership. But then again, how realistically the country at war [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3387.6000000000004s)]
*  can be admitted into the European Union. So there is some card. But I mean, I have to say the fact [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3394.0s)]
*  that Europeans are so beaten up about the fact that Trump said what he said in the story goes [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3400.0s)]
*  the way it goes. It's kind of shocking to me because clearly they are not thinking or they are [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3406.96s)]
*  living in La La Land. What did they think is going to happen? Trump is going to come in and say, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3412.4s)]
*  oh, have all the weapons in the world? And they themselves really are not contributing as much [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3416.64s)]
*  as Trump would want or America would want. And then they say, oh, no, no, no, but we are with Ukraine. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3422.08s)]
*  Fine. Be with Ukraine then. I mean, that's what Trump is saying. Be with Ukraine. Do it on your [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3427.12s)]
*  own if you're also brave. Nina Kruseva, thank you very much indeed. Thank you. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JCbVDaV6-o&t=3431.52s)]
