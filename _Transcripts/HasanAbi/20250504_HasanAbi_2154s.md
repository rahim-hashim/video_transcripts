# Talking To Chris Kunzler About The Ethan Klein Debate
**HasanAbi:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M)
*  And I feel like this is always the point. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=0.0s)]
*  You were one of the you were one of the quote unquote hate videos that he actually talked about. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1.28s)]
*  I mean I've always found it interesting that Ethan has made a concerted decision to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=7.84s)]
*  ignore me in favor of pulling up smaller TikTokers even when I'd only made TikToks. YouTube fair [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=12.16s)]
*  enough way bigger people he's chosen to ignore Noah Samson you know over Zalets people who've [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=17.28s)]
*  made really really good videos who he's just ignored but on TikTok he was pulling up like [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=21.44s)]
*  random people who made videos about him and didn't want to confront any of the legitimate criticism. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=25.12s)]
*  Hello Chris can you hear me? Yeah I can hear you. Oh on hold on let me also share my desktop with [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=30.0s)]
*  you so we can like live react to stuff together if you would like. Yeah awesome awesome. Let me [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=42.24s)]
*  also pop you out here real quick how do I do this? I sometimes forget but it is it's fantastic to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=50.72s)]
*  have you. I've been a long time supporter of your TikToks. I'm a big fan I've seen your stuff on [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=58.72s)]
*  on Gaza on the the live stream side that is being taken place on TikTok. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=68.96s)]
*  For those of you don't know Chris Konsler is a TikTokker he is I believe currently pursuing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=76.56s)]
*  his PhD right? No no no no no so I have a I have a masters and I don't have a PhD as of yet. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=82.64s)]
*  No are you not oh you haven't started pursuing? No no I haven't begun the process of beginning [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=90.64s)]
*  one I was going to be I was going to take a year out to decide what to write it about anyway and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  then I don't know I plan to come to America so that's probably not happening. Yeah well [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=100.0s)]
*  I mean Trump's America doesn't seem like the place to do a PhD I'm going to be honest. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=107.12s)]
*  Yeah so is it true that you also studied under Ilan Pappé? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=111.12s)]
*  Yeah yeah it is true so Ilan's lecturer at Exeter he but Ilan I think he's public about this but [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=119.2s)]
*  Ilan is between like different countries and he's obviously a bit of like a I don't know [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  an international superstar in the sense of as far as that goes for Palestine related stuff and he's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=132.4s)]
*  all around the world but yeah he teaches at Exeter and so I studied under him I did modules [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=137.52s)]
*  with him he wasn't my supervisor or anything but we you know spent time together he spoke [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=141.36s)]
*  at a lot of our encampments and yeah he I did study alongside Ilan at points. Wow that's that's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=146.88s)]
*  amazing so how walk me through your journey I feel like he's the was he was he instructive in your [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=152.4s)]
*  understanding of of the situation the 76 years of occupation and apartheid? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=159.6s)]
*  In a sense definitely I would actually say that much more before I'd actually even met him to be [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=167.44s)]
*  honest it was because Ilan is just like his books I don't know if you've ever spoken to him or [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=172.4s)]
*  anything but Ilan speaks very similarly and his uh the first ever book I read was just on Palestine [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=175.84s)]
*  when I was like 16 17 and I couldn't really believe that what was happened sorry 10 myths [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=182.16s)]
*  say again. What was it what I'm saying what was the name of the book like is was it 10? Oh sorry [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=188.32s)]
*  on Palestine is the name of the book oh yeah got it got it by Chomsky and Papin I remember reading [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=194.72s)]
*  it first and uh okay yeah and then they're also to be honest I would actually say one of the things [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=199.92s)]
*  is is Ilan is obviously fantastic but there are a lot of people who are who teach at Exeter that are [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  never going to receive the same sort of like uh you know kudos to Ilan who really shaped my [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=208.72s)]
*  perspective on it like people who are from the Middle East who taught me about things like [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=213.6s)]
*  Orientalism who really shaped my perspective on a place that I didn't know and understand [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=218.0s)]
*  and actually much see the thing is is I knew about Palestine before I got to uni but just learning [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  about the wider region as well was very helpful things like the Gulf things like a British [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=227.6s)]
*  colonization there much deeper and so Ilan was always an important part of that but it was always [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=231.76s)]
*  like other people at that place as well you know. Yeah um well you've been following closely uh some [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=236.16s)]
*  of the uh the uh things that the back and forth that has happened with my former podcast co-host [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=243.28s)]
*  and I believe you watched uh debate uh because there's not really a better term for it that took [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=249.04s)]
*  place on Friday and I wanted to hear your initial assessment off of it um because there were [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=255.44s)]
*  definitely some I mean there was definitely some uh moments where we discussed uh Ethan's perspective [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=261.12s)]
*  Ethan's framework uh and things that he believes I feel like it's still somewhat inconsistent with [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=268.88s)]
*  his output for the past year and a half and I know that you've like paid close attention to all of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=274.96s)]
*  that so I wanted to hear like I wanted to hear what your initial assessment was and if there's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=280.4s)]
*  any uh points that you want to address from the process did you finish it? Yeah yeah yeah so I've [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=285.52s)]
*  actually watched it I've watched it twice oh wow I watched it once I watched it once on stream and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=290.08s)]
*  then I watched it once when it was live um the thing is is that for me like as I said in my [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=295.52s)]
*  TikTok there's a certain element of just like the poverty of debate you know like I you've mentioned [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=300.0s)]
*  this you don't really debate people because what the hell is the point it's not it's not how you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=304.32s)]
*  change someone's mind like all of those tens of thousands of people who watched Ethan shout at you [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=308.08s)]
*  concede and also particularly the really important thing is that Ethan conceded right over and over [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=313.2s)]
*  again that a lot of the criticism which has been levelled at him in their alleged hate videos that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  you watched that he actually agreed with but he doesn't agree with it and I feel like this is [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=322.48s)]
*  always the point. You were one of the quote-unquote hate videos that he actually [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  talked about. I mean I've always found it interesting that Ethan has made a concerted decision to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=331.6s)]
*  ignore me in favor of pulling up smaller TikTokers even when I'd only made TikToks YouTube fair [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=338.16s)]
*  enough way bigger people he's chosen to ignore Noah Samson you know over zalitz people who've [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  made really really good videos who he's just ignored but on TikTok he was pulling up like [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=347.36s)]
*  random people who made videos about him and didn't want to confront any of the legitimate [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=351.04s)]
*  criticism because according to the debate with you he actually agrees you know he said that the IOF [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=354.8s)]
*  is a terrorist organization he said the inception of Hezbollah was noble and I think that that's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=359.44s)]
*  kind of like the key point because a lot of people like the way that sort of the propaganda [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=364.24s)]
*  operates and it operates different I mean it operates the same in both places is where being [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  accused of being a terrorist is the worst thing in the world and of course the whole point was [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=372.0s)]
*  he said oh there was a noble inception to it and largely what someone like you or I does is give [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=376.0s)]
*  context to an organization and say hey this isn't just indicative of weird back backwardness amongst [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  Arabs it is contextual amongst like the history of British imperialism and you know 76 years of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=386.32s)]
*  well no actually I'd go even further back Britain implanting a settler colony in the middle east [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=393.2s)]
*  saying it had a operation yeah 100% I mean you know without Britain this doesn't happen and there [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  were players it wasn't everyone but there were a small amount of British people who said at that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=404.4s)]
*  time don't do this don't don't set up a settler colony you're about to establish one of the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=408.24s)]
*  biggest injustices of the century Tom Segev an Israeli historian talks about a lot about this [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=412.56s)]
*  in his book One Palestine Complete and yeah I mean and so I think that like ultimately it was kind [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  of this thing of how can you really debate someone who's just going to agree with you on the most [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=423.36s)]
*  serious points but then still maintain the idea that it was anti-semitism and actually when I [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=427.76000000000005s)]
*  was watching it I pulled up someone who you've spoken to Abdul Razak Takriti? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  Oh the scholar that I had on I think about the Hezbollah militancy and its history [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=437.52s)]
*  yeah so I yeah yeah yeah he's uh he did the dig with Daniel he did that yeah exactly so one of [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=445.92s)]
*  the most excellent historians in that podcast is probably some of the best middle east education [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=452.8s)]
*  that's really available he might be the the head of middle eastern studies I forget where he what [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=456.8s)]
*  college he's at but yeah he's a he's a I think it's Texas Austin Texas is that a university [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=462.32s)]
*  I think it's that um but yeah I pulled up and he was just there was a bit where he spoke to me and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=469.52s)]
*  he just said how dare you speak about your feelings in a time like this where you know [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=474.56s)]
*  and I mean I also spoke about this on stream the death toll is bad in Gaza it's really bad [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=479.12s)]
*  but also there's so many people with catastrophic traumatic wounded injuries and in many ways people [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  view and there's a part written about this that there is somehow like a right to maim people [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=488.88s)]
*  and that that is just not as bad as you know killing 60 000 those hundreds of thousands of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=493.44s)]
*  people whose lives have been changed irreversibly where they can't move around uh exist in the same [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=498.4s)]
*  way that they once did because of traumatic injuries it has a psychological stress on people [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=503.04s)]
*  and you know it's just it's and and people want to talk about you know feelings and when you're when [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=507.52s)]
*  Ethan was so willing to admit that hey this wasn't actually that there is actually reasonable criticism [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=512.08s)]
*  here like for example I think there was one thing where you you commented on my video about when he [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=517.12s)]
*  went to said he was going to go to Israel oh this was my last straw and I mean it's he was like oh [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=521.12s)]
*  yeah I perhaps gave a bad account of myself but he doubled down on that he went over and over again [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=526.32s)]
*  why he thought that was a good thing you know and it's it's it's very hard you know it's very hard [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=531.52s)]
*  to have a debate with someone in that sense um there is a it's a it's a technique that uh [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=536.48s)]
*  Michael from Pennsylvania identified as uh I forget what it's called it's like [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=542.0s)]
*  where you immediately offer like a softened concession on a major point so that uh so that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=546.24s)]
*  if I turn back around and hammer on that same point where it's like if I draw out the doctrine [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=553.7600000000001s)]
*  of surrender thank you chatters um where you basically surrender on a major point of contention [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=559.2800000000001s)]
*  that in an effort to make it seem as though in an effort to soften the blow that it would normally [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=566.1600000000001s)]
*  have in this back and forth conversation if that if we arrived at a position where he made this [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=570.56s)]
*  concession after like fighting back against it it's a it's disingenuous especially when paired up [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=574.7199999999999s)]
*  with the inconsistencies uh that you know that uh concession presents because if you will that's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  what I tried to arrive at over and over again where um I kept saying like okay but if you think it's [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=589.04s)]
*  an alien why do you you know why do you criticize the militancy against it in every way shape and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=594.4799999999999s)]
*  form and consistently point to it as like they're bad they're bad they're bad and it doesn't make [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=599.76s)]
*  any sense and you can draw parallels as I did over and over again to you know historical acts of [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=605.04s)]
*  of militancy but of course I think whenever you have a conversation with not just like [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=612.16s)]
*  Ethan or any liberal in general they they've already they've already been indoctrinated to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=618.4s)]
*  this like incredibly whitewashed framework of history where uh previous militancies that have [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=623.04s)]
*  been successful are always whitewashing the aftermath right like whether it be the IRA [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=628.8s)]
*  whether it be the ANC I mean sure with the IRA especially like there's still a lot of um there's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=634.4s)]
*  a lot of coverage on like the atrocious nature of the IRA and the civilian targeting and whatnot [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=640.4799999999999s)]
*  but like ultimately ultimately the approach in the rear view mirror is is far more amenable to [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=645.28s)]
*  their position because they have seen some level of success there's this age-old adage on twitter [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  that I constantly point to which is uh liberals love uh every single anti-war movement except for [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=658.32s)]
*  the current one and liberals love every single civil rights struggle except for the current one [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=665.36s)]
*  only after it is you know all all is said and done will they approach the subject matter in a [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=671.5200000000001s)]
*  totally sanitized um totally sanitized manner to turn around and say okay you know this is this was [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=678.0s)]
*  good but only because they were pacifists of course and I mean also even how people view [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=686.08s)]
*  Palestine and actually how people were talking about fucking Nelson Mandela you know how people [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=691.12s)]
*  were kind of like oh he was a pacifist well also like Hamas have always gained their legitimacy [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=697.76s)]
*  from what they gained a lot of legitimacy from saying we forced Israel out of Gaza in 2005 [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=702.64s)]
*  because of our attacks on settlements because of the fact that it was too costly to have an [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=707.2800000000001s)]
*  occupation there we forced them out look what the two-state solution people are doing to you [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=710.6400000000001s)]
*  in the west bank they are bending over and capitulating to Israel they are doing they are [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=715.2s)]
*  literally it's it's obscene what you hear lots of propaganda about the Palestinian authority of his [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=719.44s)]
*  of like pro-zionist people saying oh it's just as bad as Hamas Mahmoud Abbas and all of these people [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=724.96s)]
*  blaming the president and stuff it is literally an organization which spends more time arresting [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=730.48s)]
*  Palestinians and protecting settlers than it does and Hamas will always gain legitimacy when [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  that is the exact opposite and when extreme violence from Israel is is the reality and in [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=738.6400000000001s)]
*  the case of South Africa of course there was violence from the state but it was never they [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=743.2s)]
*  didn't destroy they didn't turn the full South African military to destroy black townships ever [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=746.88s)]
*  and Israel did that in 2002 to Janine like they wiped out most of Janine yeah well not most of it [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=752.0s)]
*  but like a considerable amount and committed atrocities there and so is it really surprising [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=758.0s)]
*  that like militancy is more prevalent in the context of Palestine yeah especially considering [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  the escalation of violence the and also the timeline I mean it's just like a much longer [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=768.8000000000001s)]
*  timeline at this point much more severe and also this is I think part of the reason why I know [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=778.4s)]
*  M. Chomsky says that like at least under the apartheid structure in South Africa as opposed [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=784.48s)]
*  to like the apartheid structure in Israel the white South Africans within the apartheid government [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=789.28s)]
*  saw a need to maintain a black population that they were using as workers as opposed to Israel [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=796.4799999999999s)]
*  that simply wants to wipe out all Palestinians like their principle is their guiding fundamental [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=803.28s)]
*  principle here is exterminationist in nature as opposed to utilizing the existing Arab base as [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=810.8s)]
*  an permanent underclass I don't completely agree with Noam Chomsky on that statement because I do [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=820.4s)]
*  think that Israel still utilizes the Arab base as a permanent underclass but I guess I kind of [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=825.04s)]
*  understand that like they would rather they'd rather bring in like a Gulf nation state most [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=830.8s)]
*  likely like immigrant labor in the aftermath of like full-blown ethnic cleansing of Palestinians [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=836.4s)]
*  from all of the all of the occupied historical Palestinian territories I mean this is something [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=841.04s)]
*  talked about by Andy Klarno and I haven't read it in a while but his book neoliberal apartheid talks [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=848.48s)]
*  about how Palestinians have basically just become a surplus population there was a point at which [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=853.2s)]
*  they were quite useful to the Israeli economy and they do still like Palestinians in the West Bank [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=857.6s)]
*  now work predominantly in things like building settlements you know a very sadistic existence of [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=862.0s)]
*  you have to build the settlement which is near you or you go and work in construction in Israel so [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=866.96s)]
*  the state of Israel expands as well and they are just a population that is increasingly less useful [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=871.9200000000001s)]
*  to Israel and I think that that Chomsky is actually like pointing a little bit to like a [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=876.24s)]
*  niche part of settler colonialism in that you know Patrick Wolf the guy who's like the main [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=881.12s)]
*  theorist did not consider South Africa a settler colony which is a pretty interesting take because [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=887.2s)]
*  he said that the white South Africans were always too reliant on the black population whereas Israel [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=892.0s)]
*  from the very start once was very well it began in really the turn of the 20th century but they [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=897.36s)]
*  were interested in Hebrew exclusivist labor with nothing to do with the Palestinians get rid of them [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=902.88s)]
*  replace them with Jewish workers because otherwise it was going to be really hard to achieve what [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=906.88s)]
*  they ended up achieving which is you know like a Jewish supremacist state with only a minimal [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=910.96s)]
*  amount of Palestinians in it really yeah no absolutely so what were some of the what were [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=915.36s)]
*  some of your primary takeaways overall from like someone who was obviously pro-Palestinian and very [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=922.32s)]
*  well read on the issue someone who studied this issue as well in college what was your what was [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=926.96s)]
*  your takeaway in terms of in terms of the debate overall I think again it's just this orientalist [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=932.8s)]
*  thing of basically that some people do terrorism and some people do legitimate violence where again [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=940.08s)]
*  you know Ethan has said multiple times that people in Israel face crazy choices the army is a necessity [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=945.9200000000001s)]
*  he's proud of Hela and all of these things and it's just kind of like you know it's very hard [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=952.8000000000001s)]
*  for some people to move beyond orientalism and to see well actually there comes a certain point at [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=958.64s)]
*  which you know settler colonies are not settler colonies are violent by their very nature but I [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=962.72s)]
*  mean one of the parts which I actually just ended up skipping was the sort of part about sexual [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=969.44s)]
*  violence and I skipped it for one specific reason which was it was so pointless especially because [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  it revolves around the idea that you had denied everything when the only piece of substantial [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=977.84s)]
*  evidence brought up by Ethan was about Amit Susana that you had said at the very start about what [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=981.7600000000001s)]
*  had happened that it was a credible accusation I mean she even said that she allegedly reported it [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=986.48s)]
*  to a Hamas commander I believe and the commander said that they would deal with it or whatever [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=990.48s)]
*  I have no doubt and again it's not implausible that this kind of thing happened it is the key [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=995.68s)]
*  point that is to be said is that there is you know sexual violence did not happen mass on mass [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1000.0s)]
*  systemically and actually there was one thing or directed by Hamas as well because that would also [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1006.56s)]
*  that would also contradict why Amit Susana would even report it to a Hamas commander if she was [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1012.24s)]
*  if she believed that there would be no repercussions for what had taken place that [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1018.8s)]
*  actually also corresponds to another witness from a while back I remember reading about her [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1023.6s)]
*  testimony to the Guardian in the aftermath of her release where she talked about how [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1030.72s)]
*  there was mistreatment that took place against some of the hostages and they immediately actually [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1037.68s)]
*  told a Hamas commander to to deal with it this was this was what was so this was what was so [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1041.68s)]
*  consistent with with testimony from most of the hostages overall in terms of like you know [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1050.96s)]
*  their recognition of a of an important bargaining chip right like I I have maintained this position [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1058.8s)]
*  over and over again as people were like fantasizing about how many rapes Hamas was probably committing [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1063.68s)]
*  towards the hostages and when we didn't have as much information and I kept trying to explain [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1070.48s)]
*  people or how they had probably killed the hostages for fun or whatever and I I kept trying to say [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1075.6000000000001s)]
*  like they will not do that because this is their bargaining chip I'm not even saying that they're [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1080.16s)]
*  not going to do that from the perspective of like morality because it's the most moral force or [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1084.72s)]
*  anything like that but simply logically it doesn't make sense that's why I kept repeating over and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1088.64s)]
*  over again like if they kill hostages you'll know because they will do it on camera or they [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1093.44s)]
*  will reveal that they've killed hostages because it's it's a it's a point to apply pressure in that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1097.68s)]
*  situation it's just cold hard logic in this process right um 100 100 and I mean on this topic as well [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1102.88s)]
*  I when I when I sort of was talking about this I pulled up how france fanon said that the settlers [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1111.8400000000001s)]
*  always projected their desires onto the colonized they would always say he says specifically in the [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1116.96s)]
*  case of the southern united states uh is the white man not always saying that the black man at any [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1121.8400000000001s)]
*  opportunity would jump on the good white woman at any given opportunity lynchings would very often [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1127.2800000000002s)]
*  culminate with mutilation of people's genitals in the case of hitler he spoke constantly about how [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1132.56s)]
*  bad uh jewish boys would attack german women at every opportunity and in fact one of the most [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1138.56s)]
*  racist figures and reprehensible within israeli society merke hana there is a video of him on [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1143.9199999999998s)]
*  youtube where he speaks about he says there are currently arab boys hidden in cafes pretending [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1149.12s)]
*  that they have jewish names so they can basically uh trick jewish jewish nice good jewish girls into [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1154.24s)]
*  dating arabs he also gained a massive amount of popularity his far right horrific exterminationist [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1160.96s)]
*  ideology by saying that there were a series of nationalists um uh like motivated by terrorism [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1166.3200000000002s)]
*  nationalist hatred of israel uh rapes occurring at the time and there were these rapes occurring [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1172.0800000000002s)]
*  but it was a manipulation of like who had done it whether it was common criminals whether it was [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1176.48s)]
*  actually someone who was violent or whatever um and of course inflamed people because people [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1180.48s)]
*  always like to believe that the other is a barbarous savage who is enjoying at their expense [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1185.44s)]
*  who engages in moral excesses that are far beyond anything that you know the good moral israeli is [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1189.12s)]
*  allowed to engage in even though all we have seen is vast systemic and systemic torture against [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1194.56s)]
*  palestinian sexual sexual abuse for decades would you know there is significantly more well [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1200.7199999999998s)]
*  documented evidence for by not only uh palestinian uh advocacy groups like adamir uh but also uh [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1206.6399999999999s)]
*  independent outside investigations from the united nations that have concluded that there are uh that [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1216.48s)]
*  there is like verifiable evidence for mass uh sexual assault under detention at checkpoints in [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1222.96s)]
*  the west bank and on uh on numerous occasions throughout this like apartheid structure that [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1230.8000000000002s)]
*  they've designed sexual violence is uh systematized by the israeli military the israeli occupying force [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  and and i mean the other and i mean the other part is like they're just general i mean there's [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1242.56s)]
*  the what's it called more than a human can bear or something the un report about it the recent one [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1247.04s)]
*  uh that just discusses like israel's sexual violence against women uh gender-based violence [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1252.8s)]
*  is actually the overarching thing of the report but uh generally also like the obsessive parading [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1256.72s)]
*  round in palestinian women's underwear all of this stuff is all part of like a you know for [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1261.76s)]
*  non spoke about a psychosexual madness in the context of algeria you know 40 50 years before [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1266.48s)]
*  and and you know again like drawing back on this similarity what what they were fighting against [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1272.88s)]
*  was the same thing this like mad colonial thing this man justified anything against the indigenous [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1276.8s)]
*  people by portraying them as barbarous savages you know and i think that for me like um in that [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1281.92s)]
*  context it is very difficult to hear someone go because this is the trick it's you know you never [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1288.0s)]
*  to have a serious discussion about what israel actually does it is to go you denied this you [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1292.08s)]
*  denied this so you are bad you support terrorism so you are bad it is an appeal to emotion which [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1296.16s)]
*  is funny because always it is claimed while the palestinians appeal to emotion by showing you [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1301.2s)]
*  they're dead or showing you these things when in reality it's just this is the horror of being [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1306.16s)]
*  palestinian but also and when this is just a direct appeal to you are going to be scared of [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1310.96s)]
*  muslims and you are going to think that they do worse things because they are muslim that they are [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1316.16s)]
*  sexually bad and different and i think that you know for me that was a very interesting point [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1320.64s)]
*  and i mean i'd say that one of the hardest points to have a takeaway from was the bit where you [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1324.88s)]
*  discussed um sort of mizrahi jewish people because first of all you said pretty much everything i [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1328.4s)]
*  would say but also i don't really understand what the point of what ethan was saying was because he [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1333.68s)]
*  would not heed the fact of hey it's not right to compare these two things that you know israel that [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1338.3200000000002s)]
*  was what i thought was uh really indecent the double nakba which um i i say is uh similar to [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1343.68s)]
*  the double genocide theory that like a lot of holocaust revisionist historians try to engage in [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1350.96s)]
*  that is uh roundly criticized by other academics however it's kind of making a return now in liberal [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1356.56s)]
*  society but i'm not going to get into that but the double nakba concept is is one that i think [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1362.64s)]
*  was was one of the most disingenuous points that he presented and he did so by also misrepresenting [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1369.92s)]
*  perspective on it to try to hyper focus on literally one aspect of his own personal experience [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1376.16s)]
*  as an iraqi jew or or even like his academic work uh in in terms of like what kind of violence iraqi [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1383.44s)]
*  jews were subjected to in an effort to to make this uh really damaging comparison i was more [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1390.56s)]
*  frustrated with the comparison i never have denied that there have been anti-semitic incidents [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1396.72s)]
*  that have taken place in in numerous countries as a byproduct of pan-arabic nationalism and the [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  response and the reaction that these arab countries had towards these different arab countries by the [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1407.4399999999998s)]
*  way not palestinians once again had towards their their own jewish populations in the aftermath of [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1413.84s)]
*  the the nakba but yeah there was a point where he said sorry i keep cutting you off but there's a [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1422.6399999999999s)]
*  point where he basically said that you know arabs uh forced arab jews to become zionist which i [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1429.04s)]
*  thought was was uh interesting is an interesting statement uh because that i think is is basically [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1437.28s)]
*  like using avish lame to say that i feel like is is so strange because it directly contradicts his [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1445.04s)]
*  main point i feel like obviously his main point is the exact opposite of that the the fucking [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1451.68s)]
*  arabs to be precise that's what he said yeah i mean it's it's just i i've never thought about [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1457.2s)]
*  the perspective of double genocide because like yeah i mean there was some you know a lot of [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1462.4s)]
*  german people were removed from europe and a lot of them died uh but they were people who'd gone [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1466.96s)]
*  in and i in no way is in comparison or comparable or diminishes in any way the suffering of you know [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1471.8400000000001s)]
*  jewish people under the nazis and european anti-semitism generally but like just yeah i [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1478.48s)]
*  i mean exactly what you're saying there were also there was also just this key point of [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1484.08s)]
*  what what britain did in the middle east made promises that they did not uphold they literally [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1488.1599999999999s)]
*  promised palestinians independence in the macmahon hussein correspondence they they did [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1494.24s)]
*  categorically they they promised this to the vast majority of people within the region except for [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1499.12s)]
*  really syria because they were they had a problem with the french in terms of giving it to the [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1504.32s)]
*  french i believe but uh anyway they promised all this independence then they denied it so there's [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1508.1599999999999s)]
*  already animosity growing they set up all of these colonial regimes there that were not really that [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1512.48s)]
*  popular as once britain began to wane in terms of its power after the second world war they all began [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1516.8s)]
*  to collapse even ones like you know the egyptian uh what's it called the egyptian like monarchy and [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1521.44s)]
*  such and is it really surprising that people began to feel animosity that was linked to say blaming [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1526.64s)]
*  the british blaming israel the jewish state who could not exist without the support of the british [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1532.64s)]
*  because there was also a lot of people from around the region like people the isad in al-kasam the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1537.1200000000001s)]
*  guy that the hamas's military wing is named after was from syria he went to palestine to fight against [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1541.6s)]
*  i think he fought against the french before but he went to palestine to fight against british [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1546.7199999999998s)]
*  imperialism there is it and to ignore that context and this is always the thing and it's the thing [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1550.6399999999999s)]
*  that like uh smarter people than ethan have done samuel huntington class of civilizations all of [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1555.9199999999998s)]
*  these people they act as if islam is this dogmatic unchanging religion that has existed the same way [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1561.04s)]
*  for 1400 years and is completely uninfluenced or they'll say and i really hated the point about [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1566.7199999999998s)]
*  the part the he this is also another point like the bigotry of low expectations that people get [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1571.52s)]
*  that was that was crazy when talking about the i i hate when people i mean i can't believe he said [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1578.16s)]
*  that uh i assume that someone fed that talking point to him because like it especially doesn't [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1584.48s)]
*  fit in this position but it is an inherently white supremacist talking point as a counter when [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1590.24s)]
*  someone tries to describe the importance of material conditions in the development of of [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1595.84s)]
*  historically undermined marginalized communities to say like oh you just like have low expectations [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1601.36s)]
*  of black people because you're saying that they're like dumb and stupid it's a it's a way to try to [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1607.9199999999998s)]
*  flip the script it's a very disingenuous technique that right wingers use usually so for him to also [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1611.84s)]
*  try to uh utilize that in the conversation when i was talking about how like the material conditions [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1616.8799999999999s)]
*  uh obviously play a major role in societal development in the poorest country on the planet [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1623.68s)]
*  that has consistently been victim to imperialist endeavors and and only as recently as [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1630.72s)]
*  right before october 7 had they finally had a moment to to free to liberate themselves from [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1639.36s)]
*  like this saudi blockade this ua blockade to the western forces that actually supported and backed [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1645.92s)]
*  due to chinese intervention in the region creating a peace negotiation between saudi arabia and iran [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1650.64s)]
*  like of course they don't have a civil rights movement to to become quote unquote woke i guess [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1655.68s)]
*  like that yeah they have nothing like it's just so insane yeah i mean 100 percent like i found that [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1661.5200000000002s)]
*  particularly great thing i mean for example i pulled this up it's from an essay called homo zion by [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1668.96s)]
*  a a guy called hussein oma it's very interesting but he mentions how sodomy laws in palestine [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1674.0s)]
*  or anti-sodomy laws were introduced by the british they were repealed in palestine in 1951 [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1680.0s)]
*  and not inside israel proper until 1988 and yeah by the way his argument is that basically uh the [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1685.68s)]
*  british imperial officials imported that directly over from the raj in um in india and they did this [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1692.72s)]
*  because they have another i have another thing to bring up here homosexuality was only decriminalized [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1699.28s)]
*  in the ottoman empire in the 18th century during the tanzimat era but before that it wasn't [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1705.76s)]
*  criminalized at all they also legal fucking 18th century so when uh palestine was under otterman [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1712.0s)]
*  rulership it most likely had that same exact uh legal structure where it wasn't illegal to be gay [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1718.4s)]
*  to fucking begin with which directly undermines the point that westerners always try to make talking [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1723.68s)]
*  about the barbarity of islam and as though it's like like you mentioned uh this this uh unchanging [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1729.2s)]
*  dogmatic fundamentalist principle that they operated off of sorry i just i always like to [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1735.8400000000001s)]
*  talk about how gay the ottomans were i mean it's the same there's a very famous i've not actually [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1742.32s)]
*  read this but i know that we had a one of our lecturers would speak about it i think it's called [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1747.8400000000001s)]
*  women with beards and men no women with mustaches and men without beards or something to that effect [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1751.92s)]
*  and it's basically about gender in iran and how it really wasn't a concept until around the i think [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1758.4s)]
*  it was like the 18th or 19th century it really started being a major thing and how queer society [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1763.1200000000001s)]
*  really was over there at different points and how there is a changing thing and also it's indicative [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1767.68s)]
*  of hey maybe don't talk about a religion that is so old uh that it well 1400 years old and say oh [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1771.8400000000001s)]
*  it's dogmatic it's un it's unchanging and this is why arabs are the way they are or people in the [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1777.6000000000001s)]
*  middle east because often it's just a you know a euphemism just to mean arab basically uh muslim [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1782.0800000000002s)]
*  sorry muslim and just talking about islam but especially just in this context of like talking [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1787.84s)]
*  about someone from yemen you're completely correct like you know it's not low expectations [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1791.84s)]
*  it's look what has been happening in yemen and also another big thing is like i think if you're [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1796.1599999999999s)]
*  like trying to be a populist in a country who rails against western imperialism i am sure that [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1801.4399999999998s)]
*  there is a certain appeal of blaming societal degradation as well on western ideals and saying [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1806.1599999999999s)]
*  look they always preach how they brought you gay rights and all of these things and look how worse [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1811.28s)]
*  a country like iraq becomes no doubt that's appealing to people because of the experiences [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1815.28s)]
*  of people on the ground in the same way that as society in the west degrades people like [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1819.12s)]
*  anti-immigrant discourse because it's something to cling to and blame for the degradation here [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1823.04s)]
*  and it's not like a low expectation to say that someone might believe that it's saying well this [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1827.44s)]
*  is kind of sadly what society has come to if you are a person down on your luck you're going to [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1830.96s)]
*  want to believe that because it's easier than believing uh it's easier than addressing perhaps [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1834.8s)]
*  the more complex thing of yeah there's just a broken society where no one is offering you [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1838.16s)]
*  I've just never heard someone with your uh complexion and your accent explain this concept so [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1842.48s)]
*  so perfectly so i'm a little bit taken aback by this you know my bigotry my my my um soft bigotry [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1849.04s)]
*  of low expectations from from a british white man came out a little bit i'm sorry but you're [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1856.88s)]
*  100 correct this is something that i constantly talk about like you can you can even point to the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1863.2s)]
*  iranian revolution like the reason why fundamentalists in countries like this [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1867.68s)]
*  under western imperialism are seen as the most emancipatory forces there it is the reason why [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1872.64s)]
*  hamas also ran on an anti-corruption ticket and was able to win uh the elections that the american [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1877.92s)]
*  government the cia actually presented to uh palestine and palestinians specifically the gaza [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1884.5600000000002s)]
*  strip um the the more islamist the forces are the more fundamentalist they are the more they can [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1889.92s)]
*  present themselves as anti-west and if the entire population is is firmly committed to having an [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1894.96s)]
*  anti-western position due to all of the violence they've experienced from western imperialism [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1901.76s)]
*  they end up going with uh with these people and uh and yes the us aid interventions and [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1906.64s)]
*  ngo civil society organizations that prop up everywhere that uh that are are hyper focusing on [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1915.04s)]
*  some of the civil rights movements whether it's for good reason whether it's because they truly [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1923.92s)]
*  do want gay liberation or whatever in these countries or whether it's a mechanism of [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1928.72s)]
*  intervention doesn't matter um that is that is why there's so much hostility towards these sorts of [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1933.04s)]
*  things and towards these sorts of movements in these other countries because it's seen as a [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-whrEKXT9M&t=1939.36s)]
