# Jon Stewart Urges Dems To Fight Like Republicans | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k)
*  President Trump, Elon Musk, Don Jr., [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=0.0s)]
*  R.F.K. Jr., and Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=2.32s)]
*  Yeah, he was like, open it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=4.2s)]
*  He was like, open it, Robert. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=5.54s)]
*  Open it, take a big bite. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=7.24s)]
*  Take a bite, Robert. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=9.6s)]

*  Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr., [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=14.66s)]
*  take a bite out of that Big Mac. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=17.64s)]
*  You're gonna like it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=20.32s)]
*  Welcome to The Daily Show. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=27.64s)]
*  My name is Jon Stewart. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=29.48s)]
*  Dude, urging the Democrats to fight like Republicans [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=31.92s)]
*  and exploit loopholes is literally [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=34.12s)]
*  a one-to-one Hassan Abiy strategy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  Like, that is something that I've advocated for [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=38.68s)]
*  for the past ten f***ing years, dude. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=41.32s)]
*  It has been two weeks since the election. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=43.92s)]
*  Two months, feels like two months. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  It's been 15 years since the election. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=50.16s)]
*  It's been, I mean, this was me, election night. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=52.96s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=56.36s)]
*  Was I ever that young? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  Or ever looked that... [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=58.48s)]
*  I've been saying that since I was a brain-broken child. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=59.72s)]
*  It's pretty easy advice I gave, to be fair. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=61.72s)]
*  Yeah, wait till you hear some of the, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=64.28s)]
*  I assume, arguments that they're gonna make. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=66.88s)]
*  You can directly point to, like, many different instances, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=68.88s)]
*  like, directly, where I demand [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=71.84s)]
*  that the Democratic Party do certain things [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=75.64s)]
*  like whipping votes, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=77.24s)]
*  or demand the Democratic Party do certain things [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=78.96s)]
*  like fire the Senate parliamentarian. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=80.88s)]
*  I'm sure that he'll bring up all that s***. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=82.68s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=84.32s)]
*  But Donald Trump is returning to power, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=85.16s)]
*  and so once again, it is time to saddle up [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=86.84s)]
*  on la resistante! [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=89.48s)]
*  Because, if you remember, before Trump won the election, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=91.8s)]
*  Democrats were clear-eyed about the stakes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=97.04s)]
*  Men Americans know exactly what they're voting for. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=100.28s)]
*  He is paving the way to become a Vladimir Putin, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=102.56s)]
*  or to become an Adolf Hitler. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=106.64s)]
*  He is a threat to democracy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=108.56s)]
*  He is a clear and present danger to our democracy, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  to our way of life. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=113.2s)]
*  The damage may be irreversible. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=114.32s)]
*  The destruction could be unthinkable. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=116.88s)]
*  And it would be a betrayal of everything [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  that our framers fought for. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  You're not even gonna look up? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=122.88s)]
*  You're not even gonna, you know, a little eye contact, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=125.24s)]
*  a little inflection could drive the danger thing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=127.52s)]
*  You give it a little urgency, you know? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  I feel passionately. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=134.32s)]
*  We should fight him on the beaches, in the field. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=137.0s)]
*  God forbid the streets. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=141.56s)]
*  Yes, folks, inside. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=143.6s)]
*  It's really, is it sad that the only thing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=145.4s)]
*  that really makes it a Schumer impression [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=148.32s)]
*  is I put glasses on? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=151.04s)]
*  Is that, was it really that? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=152.16s)]
*  I mean, you applauded literally just the glasses. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=153.32s)]
*  I'm a pair of bifocals away from being Chuck Schumers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=155.6s)]
*  You bastards! [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=158.2s)]
*  Now, I assume now that the Democrats have lost [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=159.32s)]
*  to the greatest threat we've ever faced as a nation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=161.32s)]
*  That they will be forthright in acknowledging, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=164.36s)]
*  one, the Democrats' role in this catastrophic defeat, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=166.24s)]
*  and two, the bleak hellscape we now face, or... [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=169.28s)]
*  We're proud of the fact that we've defeated [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=174.84s)]
*  more House Republican incumbents [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=176.68s)]
*  than they've defeated House Democratic incumbents. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  We did flip three House seats from Republican to Democrat [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=182.24s)]
*  and gained back almost all of those [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=186.8s)]
*  that we had lost in 2022. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, almost is doing a lot of work in that sentence. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we almost gained back all we had lost. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=195.12s)]
*  Almost is kind of a load-bearing adverb, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=197.84s)]
*  spin-wise, finding a positive, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  in what is clearly not good news. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=203.88000000000002s)]
*  You can't, parents, good news we gained back [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  almost all of the children we lost on the field trip. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=211.44s)]
*  Win-win! [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  It's a new dynamic. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=215.8s)]
*  It is a willful, bright-siding, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  this shit show that we celebrate [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  in our new segment called The Audacity of Cope. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=222.28s)]
*  Now, technically, yes, Democrats have less seats, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=226.0s)]
*  but have you heard who's in those seats? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=231.32s)]
*  In this freshman class alone, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=234.44s)]
*  and I'm gonna stop for cheers for each one of these [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=236.28s)]
*  because they're remarkable, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=238.52s)]
*  we have our first trans member of Congress. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=240.04s)]
*  We have an engineer from an immigrant community [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=243.24s)]
*  in the San Fernando Valley. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  We have the first Iranian-American Democrat in Congress. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=249.2s)]
*  We have the youngest member ever elected [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  to the House from New Jersey. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=256.92s)]
*  That's not a thing! [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=258.64s)]
*  How did you go from the reasonably impressive [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=259.92s)]
*  first Iranian Democrat to hold the seat [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  to the, I think, somewhat reaching for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=264.84s)]
*  youngest person ever from New Jersey? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=267.64s)]
*  And then, by the way, to the audience, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=270.48s)]
*  if you think that that framing is not that interesting, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=272.36s)]
*  wait till you hear that this record-breaking [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=276.28s)]
*  young phenom from New Jersey is 38 years old! [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=279.2s)]
*  38 years old! [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=284.12s)]
*  God, how, come on! [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=287.92s)]
*  How far are we going with this? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=291.24s)]
*  Oh, in Illinois, we elected a ginger, ooh! [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=293.12s)]
*  Hey, yeah, yeah! [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=297.2s)]
*  We elected the first representative from Washington State, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  who looks like he has a terrible secret. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=303.36s)]
*  He ran on loneliness. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=305.76s)]
*  Wow, this is gonna be the most diverse group [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=308.44s)]
*  of Congress people to ever get all their legislation blocked. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=310.24s)]
*  So inspiring! [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  No, it's fine, people. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  Those are just lonely House Democrats. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=318.44s)]
*  How will the head of their party, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=320.12s)]
*  the outgoing president, man the ramparts [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=321.6s)]
*  during this challenging and fraught, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  peaceful transition to fascism? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=326.32000000000005s)]
*  President Biden is in Brazil. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=328.68s)]
*  Oh, God, this video is so funny. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=330.68s)]
*  But also, all right, let's see, let's see what happens. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=333.36s)]
*  He became the first American head of state [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=337.0s)]
*  to visit the Amazon rainforest. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=339.32000000000005s)]
*  He went there to highlight the dangers of climate change [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=341.64s)]
*  and the need to turn away from fossil fuels. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=344.76s)]
*  What the f***? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=347.8s)]
*  No way that desk was there, no way! [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=348.64s)]
*  They released, wait, please show me that, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=351.68s)]

*  Biden being released into the wild. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=355.68s)]
*  Not a chance! [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=357.4s)]
*  In the middle of all this, he disappeared to the rainforest? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=358.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=361.88s)]
*  Starring in what appears to be like, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  four Pixar movies in one mixed together? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=365.12s)]
*  Clearly, Up is one of them. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=368.08s)]
*  And in Kanto, I'm gonna say there's a little Moana, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=370.76s)]
*  maybe Wally, had a powerful anti-consumers. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=373.76s)]
*  Well, hopefully, listen, while he's down there, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=377.11999999999995s)]
*  hopefully he has some inspiring words for us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=381.44s)]
*  History is literally watching us now. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=382.59999999999997s)]
*  So let's preserve this secret place [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  for our time and forever, for the benefit of all humanity. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=387.76s)]
*  Thank you very, very much. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=391.64s)]
*  We lost him. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=393.23999999999995s)]
*  We released him into the wild, dude. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=394.76s)]
*  Let him live. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=396.76s)]

*  Mr. President, I'm sorry. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=408.96s)]
*  The tribe has spoken. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=410.68s)]
*  Extinguish your torch. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=411.92s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=413.4s)]
*  Maybe this is how we should do the transfer of power. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  The winner moves into the White House [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=417.08s)]
*  and the incumbent just wanders off into the jungle [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  so that his nutrients may be returned to the soil. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=421.8s)]
*  But of course, as the Democrats struggle, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=425.12s)]
*  Donald Trump headed to Madison Square Garden [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=427.28s)]
*  with his grab-em-by-the-pussy posse [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=429.64s)]
*  to do his favorite thing, watch people submit. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=431.76s)]
*  Oh, Trump likes submission in the octagon. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  He likes it out of the octagon. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=437.84s)]
*  He likes submission from his enemies [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=439.23999999999995s)]
*  and even from his new friends. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=441.2s)]
*  And by the way, it doesn't take much of a transgression [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=442.88s)]
*  to warrant a bended knee for Trump. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  For instance, last week, Trump's newly-minted [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=446.44s)]
*  Health and Human Services nominee hit Trump [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=448.44s)]
*  with a bit of a lighthearted jab about his diet. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=450.64s)]
*  The stuff that he eats is really, like, bad. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=455.2s)]
*  It's not, campaign food is always bad. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump made him kiss the ring, too. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=463.68s)]
*  Or in his case, kiss the McDonald's burger. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=466.08s)]
*  He made him sit there and pose with a goddamn big... [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he made him kiss the onion ring, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=471.84s)]
*  except McDonald's doesn't have onion rings, Burger King does. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=473.28s)]
*  It's the only good thing that Burger King has. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  The food that goes onto that airplane is like just poison. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=478.2s)]
*  A little friendly swipe, a little bit of ribbing, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=482.84s)]
*  gentle ribbing, boop, and he will pay for his insolence. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=484.76s)]
*  President Trump, Elon Musk, Don Jr., [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  R.F.K. Jr., and Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he was like, open it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=492.44s)]
*  He was like, open it, Robert. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=493.8s)]
*  Open it, take a big bite. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=495.48s)]
*  Take a bite, Robert. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=497.84s)]
*  Bob. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  Bob Jr., take a bite. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=500.88s)]
*  Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr., [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=502.92s)]
*  take a bite out of that Big Mac. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=505.88s)]
*  You're gonna like it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=508.56s)]
*  Someone said this was like when the Homelander [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  made the deep eat the octopus. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  It's exactly like that, because he does look like [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=513.64s)]
*  a deeply processed, overcooked piece of McDonald's burgle [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=517.88s)]
*  that has been left out for far too long. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=524.0s)]
*  So just like the deep is supposed to be like a sea creature [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=526.12s)]
*  eating, cannibalizing an octopus, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=529.36s)]
*  he had to do that to himself. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=532.8s)]
*  He is the burgle patty. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  Eating McDonald's on Trump's private plane. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=536.96s)]
*  Hey, yeah, what's up? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  Hey, yeah, Robert. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=542.0s)]
*  Come in here. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=544.0s)]

*  Can't take with him all the time. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=584.6s)]
*  We're gonna film it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=585.84s)]
*  I was just gonna keep going with the premise. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=586.72s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=588.32s)]
*  By the way, I know we're focused on the RFK Junior, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=590.24s)]

*  Poor Mike Johnson right there. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=594.52s)]
*  Oh, he didn't even get a seat at the cool kids' table. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=595.72s)]
*  And the sad part? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=598.32s)]
*  This whole thing was Mike Johnson's bachelor party. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=599.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, Joe and Mika Brzezinski-Scarborough, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=602.28s)]

*  why wouldn't we? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=641.84s)]

*  Say the Senate failed their advice and consent [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=915.1999999999999s)]

*  live under the thumb of oppressive fascism. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1058.52s)]
*  And then they'll go back to third-rate neoliberalism again. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1062.04s)]
*  Dems love to lose. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1064.88s)]
*  They don't give a fuck about your norms. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1068.8s)]
*  They will exploit any loophole, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1072.08s)]
*  even if they have to go through [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1074.12s)]
*  clearly closed windows to do it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1075.52s)]
*  You would think after Trump's presidency, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1079.28s)]
*  Democrats would have learned, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1081.88s)]
*  but they doubled down. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1083.84s)]
*  When Biden tried to get immigration reform [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1085.6s)]
*  into the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1087.52s)]
*  and the Senate parliamentarian told him he couldn't, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  did he respond to the rule with a loophole, or did he? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1093.08s)]
*  That's for the parliamentarian to decide, though. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  Not for Joe Biden to decide. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1099.3999999999999s)]
*  No! [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1101.6799999999998s)]
*  That's for, you take the parliamentarian [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1103.28s)]
*  and you put them in a locker, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1105.6399999999999s)]
*  and then you bring grimace in and have them, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1107.28s)]
*  that's what you do! [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1110.1599999999999s)]
*  Do you guys get what I'm saying? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1111.8s)]
*  Perhaps a demonstration is in order. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1113.24s)]
*  To get anything done, the Democrats feel like [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1114.92s)]
*  they must thread the needle to make sure, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1117.0s)]
*  oh, we have to make sure each norm follows [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1119.2s)]
*  the overly complex bureaucratic process [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1121.3600000000001s)]
*  that we created ourselves. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1124.48s)]
*  Oh, oh, the parliamentarian, oh, I can't do it [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  because the norm says, oh, I can't get anything done. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1128.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Republicans come in, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1131.28s)]
*  and all they have to do is finger-bang a donut. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1133.24s)]
*  That's all they have to do. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1134.92s)]
*  Oh, how are we gonna get Matt Gaetz in [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1135.92s)]
*  if the advice and consent, oh, there he is right there. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1138.32s)]
*  Boom, boom, there he's in there, oh, he's in! [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1141.36s)]
*  Oh, look at him, he's in! [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1144.84s)]
*  Do I have to sleep with this now? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1146.4799999999998s)]
*  I've made you all uncomfortable. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1149.36s)]
*  Now Trump has the House, Senate, presidency, and judiciary. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1151.9199999999998s)]
*  So it's gonna get harder, not easier. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1156.4399999999998s)]
*  Democrats are gonna have to forcefully play the loopholes, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1158.4799999999998s)]
*  but the good news is, you're well set up for it [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1161.76s)]
*  with the youngest congressional representative ever [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1164.8s)]
*  from New Jersey, 38-year-old LaMonica McIver, unless... [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1167.96s)]
*  Wait, I've got a loophole. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1172.72s)]
*  What if Joe Biden got his vice president to not certify... [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1173.96s)]
*  No, no, President Biden, wait, listen! [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1177.44s)]
*  Listen to the plan! [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkMuFoc1_k&t=1180.0s)]
