# The War That EXPOSED Israel’s Lies | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU)
*  Hannah Weisfeld, the executive director of progressive Jewish organization, Yachad, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=0.0s)]
*  which supports the Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, observed an interview that the board [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=3.36s)]
*  seems committed to disciplining the 36, which she believes will spark a major backlash from Jews who [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  agree with the letter. Pre-existing tensions are at a breaking point, she said. The Israel [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=12.96s)]
*  that once rallied a unified world Jewry has for some years generated deep divisions in the diaspora. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=17.12s)]
*  Intensifying risk versus deeper affinity. How Netanyahu and the Gaza War have convulsed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=22.48s)]
*  relations between diaspora Jews and Israel? I mean, I think that the diaspora Jews have [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  basically, dude, Haaretz's paywall is so crazy. Can you, can someone send me an archive link of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=36.88s)]
*  this? But I hope you hit me at the end was a perfect thing, encapsulation of what is going [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=41.84s)]
*  on with this project. Yeah. I think now would be a good time to mention there's been an average of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=46.56s)]
*  four settler attacks a day since October, 2023 to the point where there have, there has been over [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=49.84s)]
*  1,800 since 2023. Yeah. How do you get people who are checked out but still say bat shit reactionary [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=54.24s)]
*  ideals? So what I was going to say is like, there's a, there are still a really scary number of, of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=61.84s)]
*  diaspora Jews and a much, much larger number of non-Jews who are totally on board with this project. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=69.36s)]
*  That's precisely the reason why Ben Gavir and the like get so much play. Like he gets to go to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=78.48s)]
*  synagogues in America and shit like that's crazy. That's unheard of. Like that is, that is the stuff [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=84.0s)]
*  that, that's like ultra Zionist stuff. You know what I mean? This is like [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  a normalization of some of the most insane, some of the most insane elements becoming [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  infinitely more normalized within Israeli society and a committed part of the Zionist project beyond [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=106.24s)]
*  just being like a plausible deniability factor. Cause remember like settlers play this role where [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=113.84s)]
*  there is a, it offers the Israeli state some symbols of plausible deniability. And now it's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=123.92s)]
*  just like, it doesn't even matter. There's no need for plausible deniability. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=128.32s)]
*  A striking number of diaspora Jews fundamentally disagree with Israelis on the Gaza war, but the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  policies of the Netanyahu and Trump, but the events of October 7 and since have also heightened many [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=136.0s)]
*  diaspora Jews connection to Israel. Where's the crucial relationship heading? Trump is called for [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  the removal of all policy from Gaza. Jewish people say no. In mid February, the New York [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  times published a full page advertisement with these words signed by hundreds of American rabbis [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  and a list of American Jewish luminaries, actors, directors, public intellectuals. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=150.72s)]
*  The ad was a response to us president Donald Trump's announcement to remove Gossens from [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=154.48s)]
*  the Gaza strip. The rabbis and certainly the public figures generally represented liberal [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  and progressive voices, but mainstream establishment Jewish organizations voiced their disapproval to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=164.72s)]
*  the CEO of the American Jewish committee found Trump's proposal concerning and confusing. The [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  anti-defamation league responded that while Trump's involvement was essential, any plan was taken [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  into account Israel's security need and the wellbeing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=176.96s)]
*  Then in mid April, 36 members of the UK Jewish communities board of deputies published a nigh [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  unprecedented public letter in the financial times in pain in pain tones at a low for Israel [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=187.68s)]
*  and deep concern for his future. They wrote of the heartbreaking war and the partisan populism [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=191.84s)]
*  that is bitterly dividing Israeli society. Israel's souls being ripped out of Israel's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=196.0s)]
*  protesters against the war and the government demanding return to the hostages deputies wrote, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=200.24s)]
*  we stand with them. We stand against the war. We acknowledge and mourn the loss of Palestinian [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=203.44s)]
*  life. They felt it was our duty as Jews to speak out. Although the American Jews criticized Trump, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=208.08s)]
*  ultimately both statements represented an unusual public rebuke of Israel's government and policies [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=212.08s)]
*  by the largest and fourth largest diaspora Jewish communities in the world. Jews outside of Israel [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=216.16s)]
*  have long argued over Israeli policy, but rarely in mass audience, non-Jewish platforms, including [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=219.68s)]
*  critical statements from establishment Jewish figures. The letter set off shock waves within [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=224.24s)]
*  their respective communities in the U S chairman of the rabbinic Zionist coalition. The rabbinic [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=227.92s)]
*  Zionist coalition wrote that the New York times ad was intended to smear Israel and associated [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=232.64s)]
*  with a crime. It hasn't committed association of reform Zionists of America and a self-defined [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=237.44s)]
*  design is left. Rabbi declined the sign. What he thought was not a helpful statement in response [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=242.4s)]
*  to Trump's ridiculous position. The UK board of deputies, one of the oldest bodies in British [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=246.96s)]
*  Jewish life, whose members are elected by the roughly 150 constituent organizations has opened [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  an investigation into the issue and suspended members already. Hannah Weisfeld, the executive [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  director of progressive Jewish organization, Yachad, which supports the Israeli policy and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=261.92s)]
*  peace efforts observed an interview that the board seems committed to disciplining the 36, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=265.36s)]
*  which she believes will spark a major backlash from Jews who agree with the letter. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  Pre-existing tensions are at a breaking point. She said the Israel that once rallied a unified [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=274.72s)]
*  world Jewry has for some years generated deep divisions in the diaspora, but October 7 and the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=279.12s)]
*  war in Gaza have generated a whole new set of pressure points between the diaspora and Israel [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=283.92s)]
*  on certain aspects of the war in Gaza, which is by the way, not a war for the record, liberal leaning [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=287.6s)]
*  diaspora Jews. The vast majority in the U S were 70 to 75% vote. Deferred Democrat diverged sharply [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  from the Israeli government's position Benjamin and Yahoo's embrace. Trump's proposal displaced [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=298.32s)]
*  Palestinians from Gaza and among Israelis, a strong majority of the Jewish public that is support [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  it in polls. Arabs in Israel heavily are heavily opposed. Yet among American Jews, 62% majority [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  oppose that plan. The two sides differ fundamentally on attitudes towards Gaza civilians. In February, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=315.12s)]
*  2024 Pew found that a majority of us Jews support America providing humanitarian aid to civilians [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=320.64s)]
*  in Gaza. That same month, a slightly higher portion of Israeli Jews opposed such aid, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=324.72s)]
*  even if international actors were to send it. Diaspora Jewish compassion for the suffering in [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  Gaza quite clearly reflects the fact that they see far more of it than Israelis, whose mainstream [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=334.32000000000005s)]
*  news largely avoided such visuals. In the early months, British Jews were quite outraged about [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=338.72s)]
*  how the war was being fought and the Israelis just did not understand that said Weisfield. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=343.76000000000005s)]
*  Diaspora Jews and Israelis he radically share the urgent desire to retrieve the hostages Hamas is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=348.0s)]
*  holding in Gaza, but a veteran expert on American Jewish affairs who preferred to remain anonymous [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=352.0s)]
*  noted that American Jews are disturbed by Netanyahu's prioritization of destroying Hamas [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=356.0s)]
*  over hostage return to issue of a Jew in danger. A Jew that needs to be rescued is very much in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=359.12s)]
*  great in the American Jewish psyche. He said the recession of that Netanyahu is placing their lives [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=363.52s)]
*  second to destroying Hamas makes the prime minister into a political target. Yeah, this is like, dude, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=368.16s)]
*  dude, dude. This position is like, I think this position is, is basically indefensible at this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=372.88s)]
*  point to be like, Oh, Netanyahu, we have disagreements. Please do not put me in front of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=378.08s)]
*  chat. But is there a way that I can get in direct contact with you? No, there isn't. Why do you want [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=382.0s)]
*  to get in direct contact with me? What the hell? Anyway, what do I say the Israelis that say no one [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  likes Netanyahu when like he's been voted for over and over again? Yeah, it doesn't fucking matter [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=392.32s)]
*  that no one likes Netanyahu. There's a lot of there's a Netanyahu's counter Netanyahu's, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=397.84s)]
*  opposition is also still very much against the ICC considering him to be a war criminal. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=406.96s)]
*  Netanyahu's opposition is also very much in support of him bombing Lebanon, for example. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  Like, that's not opposition at all. That's ridiculous. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZIL-ykGZGU&t=419.84s)]
