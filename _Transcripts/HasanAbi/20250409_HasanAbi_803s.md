# To Day Is The Art Of The Deal | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg)
*  Where was I? Yeah, there's a lot to talk about tariffs on pause. Donald Trump pulled back [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=0.0s)]
*  this morning. All the terrorists were coming undone. I on the other hand was packing my [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  shit up. That's right. Packing my shit up. And by that I mean getting brolic as a monster. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=13.8s)]
*  I was having a fantastic evening, fantastic afternoon, fantastic pre noon, no matter [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=21.8s)]
*  where we are in the world. I'm a song. I'm a song player. This also our broadcast go [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=30.36s)]
*  to you live from sunny California Los Angeles. Folks were live and alive and I hope all those [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=33.52s)]
*  girls and MBs are having a fantastic one because today's a beautiful day. Today's a wonderful [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=37.6s)]
*  day. Today is Wednesday, ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, April 9th, 20, 25. And today's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  special day. Today's a wonderful day. Today is a beautiful, spectacular day because it's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=49.68s)]
*  a day of liberation. Trump has liberated us from the panic hands by becoming a panic and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  himself. That's right. It's hump day, baby. And we are humping the global economy still, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=61.0s)]
*  but humping it a little bit less. Woo. Let's go ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls and MBs. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=67.28s)]
*  It's liberation day once again. And I'm live. I'm alive. And I hope everyone's having a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=72.72s)]
*  fantastic one because today's a beautiful day. Today's a wonderful day. Today is the art of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=78.39999999999999s)]
*  deal. That's right. The art of the deal, the art of the steel. This is part of the broadcast [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=82.63999999999999s)]
*  where I tell you about my personal news about what's going on in the world of a song. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=86.8s)]
*  Hassanabi piker in between the time period where I pressed the star streaming button and pressed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=90.63999999999999s)]
*  to stop streaming button. So help me God, I will explain it away. Ladies and gentlemen, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  last night I entered the broadcast after what? Like seven hours and eight hours. I don't know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=102.88s)]
*  Some, some light, some little, some, some little, some light. I was tired and the broadcast. What [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=108.08s)]
*  did I do? I immediately started reading. I, I did not actually stop working. I just stopped [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=114.0s)]
*  streaming. What was I reading? Of course I was trying to make sense of what was going on with [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=121.44s)]
*  these treasury yields, these bonds, all of these complicated financial machinery that was taking [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=127.2s)]
*  place considering that the foreign markets were dumping some of the American dollars they had [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=134.96s)]
*  actually purchased in the past. And what does that mean? What is going on? Why are they doing this? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=141.84s)]
*  Is Donald Trump correct? Talking to some people who are knowledgeable, but maybe not on the same [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=146.72s)]
*  wavelength as myself, you know, some economists who I have healthy disagreements with. And I, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=152.08s)]
*  that's what I was doing. That's, I don't believe you. Okay. In any case, how come you read and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=160.24s)]
*  study after stream on like your haters? Yeah, I just read and study so I can be a better hater. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=165.36s)]
*  All right. So all of that obviously is still in a tumultuous, all of that was put for a spin [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=169.84s)]
*  because I had a, I had an attitude about what was going on. Some of my stances changed a little bit. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=175.52s)]
*  We'll talk about that obviously, but you know, interesting things are happening in the world. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=181.84s)]
*  Interesting things are happening in the world. This global trade is put on a tailspin. Once again, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=188.8s)]
*  EU escalates retaliatory counter tariffs alongside China. Donald Trump packs onto the Chinese [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=194.16s)]
*  tariffs. We're going to get to all of that and more. Okay. But, but, but we will, we will get [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=201.04s)]
*  into all of that in a second, but that's basically what I did. And I realized that maybe [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=209.44s)]
*  Yannis Varoufakis is right. I mean, he's right. We still think it's a stupid concept. He believes [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  the stupid thing that Donald Trump was doing. I believe it's a stupid thing that Donald Trump was [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=221.2s)]
*  doing, but I will get into all of that. But also can you give my little sister her t-shirt back? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=224.0s)]
*  Oh, you don't like, you don't like the sexy ass shirt that I got a Mexico, Mexico. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=229.92s)]
*  Um, but, um, yeah, I'm going to try to see if I can get Yannis on the broadcast, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  but I will have someone else on the broadcast today. His name is Nathan Tankas. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  You guys might know him. He is Paul Krugman's favorite analyst. Nathan Tankas famously once [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  posted a tweet that I have used in perpetuity. The essence of being a leftist is being dismissed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  as un-serious for being correct too quickly. Um, obviously I'm going to, I'm going to have him [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=258.72s)]
*  come and explain some of these, uh, concepts. He is brilliant. He's very smart guy. He's a very, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=265.04s)]
*  very smart dude. He's literally, uh, I mean, he's, he's, he's brilliance. Uh, although he's a leftist, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=270.72s)]
*  his brilliance has been, his brilliance has been admired by the likes of Paul Krugman. So that's, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=276.88000000000005s)]
*  I think it's pretty solid. You got a pretty solid track record at that point. If you got a Nobel [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  laureate, uh, who I don't, uh, agree with in their worldview, but if you got guys like that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=287.04s)]
*  agreeing with your analysis, then you must be doing something right. Yes. Nathan also has a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=294.32s)]
*  really great words on Israel as well. He's very smart dude in any case, in any case, in any case, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=299.92s)]
*  Hassan's crop tops are a gift from a lot. Yeah. So where was I? Uh, yeah, there's a lot to talk [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=306.0s)]
*  about tariffs on pause. Donald Trump, uh, pulled back, uh, this morning, all the terrorists were [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=311.12s)]
*  coming undone. I, on the other hand was packing my shit up. That's right. Packing my shit up. And [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=319.04s)]
*  by that, I mean getting brolic as a monster. Okay. Donald Trump also last night said, be cool. It's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=326.0s)]
*  a stick up. Be cool. Always a sign of confidence. Here's a photo of me as Zoran. Here is, uh, some [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=333.36s)]
*  fun words from the Chinese social media, but this right here, ladies and gentlemen is me, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=341.2s)]
*  your boy, hitting 230 pounds for eight and a clean seven on the eighth one. Maybe it's a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=347.04s)]
*  little bit too rough. Look at us go the distance every time. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=353.6s)]
*  Look at that. God damn. My they're out of control, dude. Look, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=363.6s)]
*  on the last one, my ass flew off the bench, which is not good, but honestly we'll, we'll take those. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=372.72s)]
*  We'll take those. We'll take those. We'll take those two 30 for eight. It's pretty good. Pretty [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=377.68s)]
*  big deal for me. Okay. Let me tell you, obviously it's nowhere near my, my lifetime PR, but it [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=383.04s)]
*  doesn't matter. I'm getting back to it. So I'm actually kind of happy about it. Like remember, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=388.4s)]
*  a year ago, I could not do any flat bench press on the barbell because it would my shoulders up. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=394.96s)]
*  And now my shoulder stability is out of control. It's too stable. People are saying, people are [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  saying it might be the most stable shoulders in the United States of America. Your trainer's body [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=407.2s)]
*  is insane. Yeah, of course. I mean, he is a trainer, but it was, it was, it was fantastic. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=412.24s)]
*  Very excited about that. And that is actually after I expended a lot of energy doing big squats, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  not the biggest squats, but three Oh eight for a clean six on my top set. Like not the best. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=426.0s)]
*  I will admit I should be significantly, I should be putting up significantly higher weight on my [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=432.48s)]
*  squats and I should be putting up significantly higher weights on my, on my bench press as well. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=437.44s)]
*  But this is, this is after it is coming after I did the squats as well. So I'm, you know, I'm pretty [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=441.36s)]
*  happy with it. Pretty happy with it. It's always a good day when I get to outlift my trainers, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=448.64s)]
*  even though they're obviously like almost a hundred pounds lighter than me, but it's still. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  So yeah, that's my thanks for setting up features. Does the team help you book that stuff or is it [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=457.44s)]
*  all done personally? You don't want to know the answer. The answer is I do it myself. Yes, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  I do it myself. I do use minoxidil with finesse ride. Yes. Only through a, you got to bump those [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=467.04s)]
*  numbers up cutie. You should be able to do way more. Okay. Shut the fuck up. I know like you, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  Hey, you don't have a six or four frame. Okay. I'm trying to overcome my genetics and you're [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=476.8s)]
*  over here talking shit. I'm three Oh eight for six. The great thing you're showing to the majority of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  people at the gym. I know, but that's not, I'm, I'm adjusting my strength to where I should be. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=486.16s)]
*  And as someone who's my size, I'm thinking about my relative strength to my weight and my relative [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=491.6s)]
*  strength to my weight is obviously not great. But anyway, do you have a PT or are you making your [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=497.68s)]
*  workout plan solo? No, I have a personal trainer. Yes. I've two friends who are also my personal [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=504.16s)]
*  trainers. You saw one of them spotting me in that last one. So six and five guy, I feel your pain. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=509.04s)]
*  Aping next got us out here suffering. Yeah. Those will be like five, six and, and we'll be like, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=515.04s)]
*  Oh, I don't understand. Like why can't you lift a lot more? It's like, yeah, dude, because my build [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=521.36s)]
*  is not with the exception of monstrous people like Tom Haviland. Like my build is not conducive for [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=526.16s)]
*  this. You know, do you pay them? Yes, I do. I do pay them. But in any case, that's, that's it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=531.52s)]
*  That's neither here nor there. That's all we got for today. For my own personal news. We're so much [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=540.16s)]
*  to discuss, obviously. So I'm, I'm going to get right into it. So let's blast off and let's do it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=547.36s)]
*  Let's do it. Where, where was I? Where was I? Where was I? What was I going to say? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=553.6s)]
*  Wait, can smaller people lift more relative to their body relative to their body? Wait, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=562.0799999999999s)]

*  All right. All right. All right. Um, Trump hits the panic can button and reverses [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=572.72s)]
*  tariffs for some is Tim pool. Dick riding Israel. We'll talk about that as well. Obviously they see [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=581.36s)]
*  this fucking fantastic story that everyone is like ripping into Tim old Timmy boy, old Timmy two time. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=589.44s)]
*  Okay. Old Timmy two time. He found a new country that he can Dick ride. Uh, maybe for some financial [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=595.28s)]
*  gain. You know what I mean? Old Timmy cook. Trump is getting cooked. Timmy's getting cooked. Everyone's [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=602.48s)]

*  donating money. I can't see the thing that you're sending me. Just write it in the chat. There's no [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=613.52s)]
*  reason for you to pay to write a tiny thing on the corner of the stream. I can't see it. And [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=618.16s)]
*  it goes by too fast. Okay. Market madness continues. Um, on later to explain away [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=624.7199999999999s)]

*  when are we getting a gaming on the stream again? Schedule one looks awesome. I don't know. Israel [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQ-9URQvrg&t=646.7199999999999s)]
