*  Oh yeah, that's the other side of this. Of course. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=0.0s)]
*  Because look, Joe Rogan and these like podcast bros aside, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=3.0s)]
*  Americans don't fuck with this stuff. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=7.5s)]
*  Like they don't. So every time this administration is like, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=10.1s)]
*  we're disappearing people because of Israel and also because [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=13.1s)]
*  of anti-Semitism because Israel is for the Jews and Jews are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=17.8s)]
*  for Israel. Jews only care about Israel is the thing that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=21.3s)]
*  people are going to take away from this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=31.0s)]
*  Let me see if there's any like actual hogwash that we can dust [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=32.4s)]
*  and show dust and show. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=36.0s)]
*  Yeah. Reacting to Senator saying men and women are equals [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=38.2s)]
*  questions raised by false deportations and arrests of pro-Palestinians. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=41.6s)]
*  Oh wait, this is going to be Joe being woke because he has the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=45.8s)]
*  oh actually never mind. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=48.6s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  Joe Rogan experience. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  You want to talk about this? 31 year old makeup artist falsely [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  deported to El Salvador prison lawyer says immigration [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  attorney say gave it as well and make a bar to seeking asylum [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=58.9s)]
*  in the US was wrongly detained as a gang member and deported [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=63.4s)]
*  to El Salvador a case becoming a flashpoint in the debate over [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  the Trump administration's deportation of hundreds of migrants [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=70.0s)]
*  to a notoriously inhumane El Salvador mega prison. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=73.0s)]
*  So again, this is it's hard to know. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=77.9s)]
*  Yes, it's hard to know what's real and what's not real. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=80.6s)]
*  But if it is real, this is so funny. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=83.0s)]
*  It's always is always hard to know if new information that's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=87.1s)]
*  coming my way is challenging my pre-established biases of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=92.0s)]
*  yet Trump always being in the right. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=97.1s)]
*  Yep and saving America. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  It's hard to know. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=101.5s)]
*  Yeah, no it if any time the information is credible from a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=102.8s)]
*  credible source from an accredited source. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=108.5s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't see this on a Facebook. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=111.5s)]
*  I didn't see this on a Facebook post. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=112.8s)]
*  It's like some sort of obscure deep like random ass article [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  from some like fringe website that is has no credibility [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=125.1s)]
*  That's the thing that you follow. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=126.0s)]
*  I just can't understand this idea that like for some reason [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=127.8s)]
*  that are correct and those are the things you should listen [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  to and you should throw out anything that's accredited or [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=136.4s)]
*  or you know, it has been just confirmation by research or is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=140.6s)]
*  confirmation or education or anything like that his mind he [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=147.6s)]
*  thinks in his mind he thinks everything Trump's doing is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=150.7s)]
*  good. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=153.9s)]
*  So obviously this doesn't make him feel good because like deep [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=154.5s)]
*  down inside there's still a human being down there that's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=158.7s)]
*  going hey, it's kind of fucked up that we're just like randomly [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  sending people over to this like slave labor camp in El [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  Salvador, which is totally illegal by the way, you know, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=167.2s)]
*  but I've become less angry at hogs and more angry at Democrats. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=170.6s)]
*  You're okay. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's the welcome. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=177.1s)]
*  Well, no because it's like these Democrats know better because [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=179.1s)]
*  yes, or they're supposed to know. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=181.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, the thing is is like I have I'm so angry because it's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  like look like I feel bad for a lot of these people are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=187.7s)]
*  fucking disenfranchised and they they don't have they can't [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  afford to feed their families and there have been multiple [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=195.4s)]
*  different Democratic administrations over the last several [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=198.3s)]
*  generations and the wealth inequality gap has only gotten larger. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=201.3s)]
*  So if you are desperate and you live in middle America and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  you can't feed your family and grocery prices are high and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  you your wages stagnated and you can't afford a house and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  education is through the roof. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=215.4s)]
*  You're desperate and you're more vulnerable to start to believe [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=217.0s)]
*  these crazy batshit ideas because at the very least the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=223.8s)]
*  Republicans are good at messaging and in connecting to their [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=227.3s)]
*  base by appealing to their anger. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=231.8s)]
*  Yeah, they identify that people are angry. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=234.5s)]
*  They then take that anger and move it in a direction that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=237.0s)]
*  suits their purposes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  The Democrats on the other hand are like, why are you angry? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=242.8s)]
*  Everything is great, you know, and that's what's making people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=244.8s)]
*  even angrier in general. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and they and they just never learn. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=249.9s)]
*  But if you think about it, Joe, like I say, if you're rounding [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=252.8s)]
*  up hundreds of people mistakes are going to get made because [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=256.1s)]
*  everyone's human and you then have to have a system. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  I love first of all, I mean if we're deporting people like [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  what's this guy doing? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=264.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, how come this guy doesn't get deported? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=266.1s)]
*  Okay, what's that about them? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=268.1s)]
*  I think that allows you to amend and make adjustments for that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=271.2s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=276.1s)]
*  And it can't be bury your head in the sand. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=276.8s)]
*  No, it didn't happen. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=278.6s)]
*  No. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=279.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=280.2s)]
*  And this is the trouble with government incentive structures [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=280.70000000000005s)]
*  all wrong like to admit that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=283.1s)]
*  Bro, what are they talking about? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=284.5s)]
*  The entire reason why this is happening. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=286.0s)]
*  The entire the entire reason why this is happening is because [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=288.3s)]
*  there's no due process. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  That is his government that he endorsed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=294.3s)]
*  That is the guy he endorsed and that is what he is doing and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=297.1s)]
*  that is what his fan base is pushing for. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=301.1s)]
*  There's it's not about an incentive structure. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=303.3s)]
*  It is a deliberate it is a deliberate mechanism of mass deportations [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  that are done expeditiously without due process in direct [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=311.70000000000005s)]
*  violation of court orders. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=315.5s)]
*  That is now embarrassing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=318.1s)]
*  That's crazy, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's scary. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=322.5s)]
*  We have the same problem in the UK in terms of the illegal [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=323.1s)]
*  immigration and if we ever get a government that's going to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=325.6s)]
*  deal with that, we're also going to have to remove a lot of people [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=328.5s)]
*  who are there illegally. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=331.70000000000005s)]
*  They shouldn't be there. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=332.5s)]
*  A lot of them are and you know, like I said, we had a [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=333.3s)]
*  report that shows they're way more likely to commit sexual [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=335.3s)]
*  crimes way more likely to commit violent crimes the way more [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  likely to commit all sorts of crimes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=341.7s)]
*  We are going to have to remove them, but you have to who I'm [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  from the UK who's this loser. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=345.8s)]
*  He's a trigger nometry is the name of the trigger nometry is [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=347.0s)]
*  the name of the or is it trigger nometry or trigger nomics [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=350.7s)]
*  whatever it's called. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=354.2s)]
*  It's like the name of the podcast do it in a way where there's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=355.0s)]
*  due process. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=357.6s)]
*  They're like woke supposedly centrist guys trick knowledge. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=358.1s)]
*  No, no, this is not a I mean, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=363.0s)]
*  This is a child of Yakub, but and I respect are they trying [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=365.2s)]
*  to remove them in England? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=367.9s)]
*  No, no, no, no, they're saying they are but they're not removing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=368.9s)]
*  them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=373.7s)]

*  You know, it's kind of wild that these guys podcast every [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1107.0s)]
*  single person on this podcast has made a living talking about [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1111.0s)]

*  Okay, the trigonometry guys have done thousands of hours [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1129.0s)]
*  on woke cancel culture and free speech. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1134.4s)]
*  Thousands. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1137.5s)]
*  This is a direct real threat to free speech. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1139.0s)]
*  This is an actual existing living breathing real-world [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1145.2s)]
*  example of a violation of the First Amendment and these guys [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1149.8s)]

*  Do the fucking reading right now. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1159.3s)]
*  And then make up your mind afterwards. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1162.2s)]
*  How the fuck are you oblivious to this as someone who is a [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1165.0s)]
*  cancel culture warrior? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1168.6s)]
*  These people are fucking cowards. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1170.1s)]
*  I know they're conscious here says something different, but [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1172.4s)]
*  their careers force them to not say what they truly mean and [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1177.7s)]
*  that can go in either direction by the way. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1183.2s)]
*  Ultimately, it could go in either direction. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1185.9s)]
*  They could be like, nah, it's actually awesome that they're [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1187.8s)]
*  doing this, but they're too afraid to say it out loud because [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1189.5s)]
*  they recognize what that sounds like. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1192.0s)]
*  Or they're thinking, yeah, this is a little bit fucked up, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1194.2s)]
*  but I can't say it because I have to be pro-Trump. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1196.7s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1198.8s)]
*  I also show requested hogwash and then left when it started. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1199.2s)]
*  I know the we're rapidly approaching the time where America [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1201.4s)]
*  and the UK are gonna is going to have a pretty uncomfortable [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1206.7s)]
*  debate as to what is acceptable and what is unacceptable when [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1210.4s)]
*  it comes to dealing with people who come here illegally people [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1215.4s)]
*  who commit crime or even if they attend protests, where is [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1219.8s)]
*  it? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1225.6000000000001s)]
*  Where is the line? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1225.7s)]
*  Because we're going to have to make a decision because until [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1226.5s)]
*  we do that and we start to actually apply the law as it's [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1229.1000000000001s)]
*  meant to be applied and input certain laws in place then [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1232.3s)]
*  these type of things are just going to continue to happen. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1235.7s)]
*  Yeah, 100% especially if someone wants them to happen because [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1238.1000000000001s)]
*  that's what my fear is that a lot of these things are paid [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1241.5s)]
*  for and organized and including a lot of these protests at [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1244.4s)]
*  universities. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1247.6s)]
*  I think they're doing it on purpose and I think they're trying [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1248.6s)]
*  to build up a lot of passion in these people for being disruptive [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1251.3999999999999s)]
*  and a lot of passion for protest and passion for and then they [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1257.6999999999998s)]
*  weaponize it. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1261.1s)]
*  I really do. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1262.3s)]
*  I believe that's exactly what they did with the Tesla buildings [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1263.5s)]
*  with all the Tesla dealerships being light on fire. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1266.1999999999998s)]
*  They weaponized it and it's a good test run, you know, if [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1268.1s)]
*  they can weaponize it against Tesla they can they can do that [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1272.0s)]
*  with a lot of other things to justify that kind of vandalism [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1274.6s)]
*  and fire and arson and all the chaos and property destruction. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1277.6s)]
*  I went to UCLA campus. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1281.8999999999999s)]
*  This was May last year and I went to a pro-Palestine demonstration [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1284.3999999999999s)]
*  and I just went around just interviewing people talking to [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1288.6999999999998s)]
*  students and both on pro-Palestine and the other side and [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1291.6999999999998s)]
*  one thing one of the kids said to me was as he was trying to [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1296.3999999999999s)]
*  get into the library. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1299.1999999999998s)]
*  He was like, you know, most of the people who are doing this [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1300.1s)]
*  they're not from UCLA. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1303.1s)]
*  They're not from this college campus. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1305.1999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1307.1s)]
*  What are they doing here? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1307.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1308.6s)]
*  He goes look. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1308.9s)]
*  Wait, is he talking about the the counter protesters because [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1310.0s)]
*  I was there. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1313.3s)]
*  The protesters were absolutely UCLA students. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1314.8s)]
*  The counter protesters were not UCLA students. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1318.2s)]
*  So the idea that the college campus protesters were actually [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1322.0s)]
*  not UCLA students is a fucking abject lie. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1326.4s)]
*  Is he is he just flipping the truth? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1328.5s)]
*  Is that what's going on? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1331.1s)]
*  But fair enough if you want to protest and you go to UCLA. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1332.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1334.9s)]
*  He literally is lying. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1335.7s)]
*  He's saying the exact opposite of what happened. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1337.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1340.3s)]
*  Oh my fucking God. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1341.8s)]
*  It is insane. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1343.8s)]
*  It is insane. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1345.8s)]
*  He said May last year. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1348.0s)]
*  Yeah at the time I went there for the record like when I [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1349.0s)]
*  went to the UCLA campus brothers, I guess he was there [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1352.2s)]
*  too and he's claiming that the campus student protesters [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1354.6s)]
*  were not actually students but the counter protesters I guess [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1360.0s)]
*  implied is they were. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1363.3s)]
*  And the exact opposite is the truth for the record. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1365.7s)]
*  That's all cool. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1369.1000000000001s)]
*  Whatever number one don't stop me from getting an education [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1370.2s)]
*  when my parents have paid X amount for it. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1373.1000000000001s)]
*  But number two like he pointed at one of the dudes. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1375.2s)]
*  He was like that guy's about 42. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1377.9s)]
*  I know he doesn't go to my college. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1380.7s)]
*  Why is he here protesting? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1382.6000000000001s)]
*  It's being paid. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1385.1000000000001s)]
*  I can't tell if he's is he still talking about the count. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1386.1000000000001s)]
*  It feels like he's talking about the counter protesters. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1389.5s)]
*  You aren't at Columbia bro. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1391.8000000000002s)]
*  No, he's talking about UCLA. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1393.0s)]
*  They're talking about you. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1394.6999999999998s)]
*  Okay, good one chatter. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8O5EgeocUU&t=1397.0s)]
