# My Father Is Not A Billionaire | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY)
*  Why would I have gone to a fucking state school and graduated from a state school? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=0.0s)]
*  If my father is a multi billionaire, what makes you think that I would not have gone to Harvard? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=6.32s)]
*  If that was the case? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=15.0s)]
*  What? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Sorry for spamming speaking or money. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=22.12s)]
*  I've been talking to my friends about you and they keep insisting you have a billionaire dad and they show this website as proof. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=23.76s)]
*  Dude, you're doxing my fucking dad while also claiming he's a billionaire. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=29.16s)]
*  I've never even seen this website, but that is pretty funny. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=36.68s)]
*  Unveiling his empire, real estate and portfolio staple. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=40.6s)]
*  He has none of this shit. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=45.28s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  This is an AI written website. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=47.4s)]
*  Are you okay? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=49.4s)]
*  What? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=50.56s)]
*  It says he has five billion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=51.72s)]
*  Net worth is five billion dollars. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=54.6s)]
*  I take care of my dad financially and my mom. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=58.08s)]
*  This is news to me that this entire time he was hiding five billion dollars of assets. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=63.72s)]
*  If only I had known that there are AI bot written websites out there who are claiming that his net worth is five billion dollars. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=71.6s)]
*  Hey, King, my mom saw you last night on CNN and asked me if you were Jewish. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=82.36s)]
*  He looks Jewish. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=85.12s)]
*  We're Jews. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=86.72s)]
*  So this is a compliment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=87.52s)]
*  I like that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  That site was an IP grabber. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=89.92s)]
*  You need a new IP address. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=91.52s)]
*  Wait, is it nice? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  Great. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=94.28s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=94.8s)]
*  All sites are technically IP grabbers. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=95.6s)]
*  So I don't know how that works, but I hope people I hope people understand that if you believe shit like that, I'm sorry. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=97.92s)]
*  You're an absolute fucking dumbass. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=105.8s)]
*  Okay, that's it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=108.08s)]
*  If you believe in shit like that, you're just an absolute fucking dumbass. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=110.24s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=115.32s)]
*  I don't know what else to say. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=115.96s)]
*  It's literally true though. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=119.0s)]
*  Well, it's fucking news to me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=119.36s)]
*  It is funny though that like people will be like, nah, actually it's true. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=121.28s)]
*  You don't know this random AI. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=124.72s)]
*  This random AI website actually knows the truth. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  There's no there's no explanation for how this occurs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=130.92s)]
*  And yet he's not on any like Forbes list. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=134.84s)]
*  You know, because I feel like at that point, if you're a billionaire, you're on you're going to appear on some lists of the wealthiest people. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=137.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=144.04s)]
*  Yeah, that would make him the second wealthiest person in Turkey. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=144.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=148.6s)]
*  If his net worth well Murat, his name is Murat. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  My brother's name is Murat. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=153.56s)]
*  Maybe there's a connection there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=155.52s)]
*  Yeah, this would make my father the second wealthiest person in the country. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=157.24s)]
*  Do you understand how stupid people are? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  Why would I have gone to University of Miami and then Rutgers? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=166.8s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=171.6s)]
*  Why would I have gone to a fucking state school and graduated from a state school? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=173.32s)]
*  If my father is a multi billionaire, what makes you think that I would not have gone to Harvard? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=179.6s)]
*  If that was the case, brother, you say that like they're poor schools, Rutgers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=188.32s)]
*  I went to Miami with a scholarship, but Rutgers, what are we doing now? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=192.8s)]
*  Like, are we acting like Rutgers is not a state school? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I'm in the South different perspective. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=200.64s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=202.72s)]
*  Being from the South does not change this concept at all. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=204.0s)]
*  OK, as far as schools go, and by the way, I literally also still while paying in state [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=208.64s)]
*  tuition, still had to take out student loans for the record. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=215.0s)]
*  But again, didn't realize that that was also something I didn't have to do because my [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=218.76s)]
*  father happened to be the second wealthiest person in Turkey, just not showing up on this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=223.72s)]
*  list for some secret reason reason had to pay had to pay my own student loan debt. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=228.0s)]
*  My brother's student loan debt. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  My mom's student loan debt, which, you know, I was very privileged and very fortunate [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=236.88s)]
*  enough to be able to do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=241.32s)]
*  Wait, Rutgers is cheaper than my school. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=242.4s)]
*  Maybe I'm a champagne socialist, too. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's called quiet old money. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=245.56s)]
*  Yeah. Anyway, what the fuck are we doing this morning? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  What a crazy way to start today. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  Tyrone Lee, thank you for the 10. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  Give this subs. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  If you ask Chad, TBT says a billion, what approximately amendment because of his net [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=256.12s)]
*  worth is estimated to be approximately five billion. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=260.88s)]
*  His wealth comes from a combination of real estate investments, business ventures, his [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  roles, a bunch of holding his major strategic investments in his properties, particularly [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=265.47999999999996s)]
*  in Istanbul and New York City, which have significantly contributed to his net worth. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he's a real estate mogul in both Istanbul and also New York City. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=272.64s)]
*  You know, it's really funny about the Sabancı holding situation. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=278.0s)]
*  He was he was the executive vice president. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=280.96s)]
*  This is something I've talked about before, but of Sabancı, which is like a massive holding [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=283.36s)]
*  group other than coach, it's like the second largest holding group in Turkey at the time. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=290.8s)]
*  This would mean he's richer than the founder of the holding group. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=295.96s)]
*  OK, as in he's wealthier than the person who is the founder and like the CEO of the holding [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=299.72s)]
*  group by massive numbers to buy billions of dollars. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=308.4s)]
*  Make this make sense. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=313.04s)]
*  Make this make sense. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=314.96s)]
*  You can tell who's heard of the piker cars. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=317.36s)]
*  Yeah, I've talked about my family's finances before, like every generation of my family [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=320.04s)]
*  has has made a shit ton of money and then lost it all by the time that they're like [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=326.4s)]
*  next of kin next up gets to college. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=330.92s)]
*  It has happened in both sides of my family as well. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=334.68s)]
*  Not that it fucking matters, because I use that to explain to you all the time that the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  Republican concept around wealth is actually built on a faulty premise. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=345.44s)]
*  Ben Shapiro will always say actually, you know, what, like only only 10 percent. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=351.0s)]
*  Like, do you know how much money is passed down every year from one generation to the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=357.92s)]
*  next is like 10 percent? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=363.0s)]
*  You are lying. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=364.12s)]
*  OK, you are lying when you say that, because when you're rich, even if you fucking lose [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=365.88s)]
*  all that wealth by the time someone like myself, for example, I guess, being from personal [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=371.23999999999995s)]
*  experience, when you grow up affluent, as I did right by the time you get to college, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  even if you go to college in America where you get a slate wiped, basically, because [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  you have no network in the same way in the United States of America, I still did not [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=384.28s)]
*  have to work to ensure that I took care of my family. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=390.12s)]
*  That would have over my schooling in the process. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=397.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? There's a tremendous amount of different societal pressures that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=401.84s)]
*  I did not have to withstand as a consequence of growing up affluent, even if they had no [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=405.68s)]
*  money by the time I got to college. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=411.08s)]
*  It still doesn't matter, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  Because I got a tremendous education. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  I'll give you one example. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=417.32s)]
*  OK, not a very good test taker in Turkey. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=418.84s)]
*  There are, you know, there's a lot of emphasis placed on tests and you can go to some of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=422.52s)]
*  the best public schools in the country. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=428.2s)]
*  Some of the best schools in the country are public schools still to this day. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=429.79999999999995s)]
*  Right. But you have to be really good at taking these tests in both eighth grade and also, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, before you get to college. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=440.08s)]
*  And because I was dogshit in eighth grade in my standardized testing. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=442.12s)]
*  OK, I was not able to get into very good high schools, very good public high schools. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  But because of the affluent position of my family at the time, I still went to a really [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  good private school. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=461.6s)]
*  OK, that is a massive leg up. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=463.24s)]
*  That is a massive, massive leg up. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  So money helps in very unique ways that are not immediately visible. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=469.48s)]
*  OK, a lot of people discount this and they don't understand it and they don't recognize [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=477.8s)]
*  it. And that's why people like Ben Shapiro will be able to falsely paint this, this [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=483.20000000000005s)]
*  narrative that like wealthy people only give wealthy people only give their next of kin [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=488.84000000000003s)]
*  a leg up by by, you know, leaving them money when they pass away. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=494.44000000000005s)]
*  That's that's nothing. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=500.32000000000005s)]
*  That's marginal. If your dad had all this money, why did you have to pay off Moran's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=501.92s)]
*  tuition? Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=505.44000000000005s)]
*  As long as admitted he comes from money. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=507.36s)]
*  Wait, what? I have never not recognized that chatter. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=508.8s)]
*  The problem with a lot of people is that they don't understand. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=512.24s)]
*  They don't understand that. Like, these are things that I have very openly talked about. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=517.24s)]
*  I've always talked about this. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=521.16s)]
*  I've talked about it in the same exact framework that I just described about, like how [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=522.72s)]
*  Ben Shapiro lies when he says that wealth is only passed down at the point of like [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=526.92s)]
*  someone passing away. That's that's incorrect. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=531.92s)]
*  There there are very there are invisible ways in which affluent individuals can ensure [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  that their next of kin is set up to basically to basically maintain the same social [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=541.04s)]
*  mobility. OK. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  And people still that up sometimes. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=549.88s)]
*  But having said that, having said that, the idea that like the idea that this is just [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=552.16s)]
*  a direct wealth transfer at the point of, you know, the the person dying is silly. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=560.28s)]
*  And regardless of my financial circumstances went from growing up very affluent to, you [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=565.6s)]
*  know, no longer being affluent at all and having to take out student loans and do all [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=572.96s)]
*  this shit. But it doesn't really matter. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=577.88s)]
*  You're going to have to clarify now that the money you came from isn't. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=579.64s)]
*  Yeah. And it was at never the point of a billionaire. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=582.48s)]
*  What do you mean? That is also completely false. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  There's a complete fabrication. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=588.28s)]
*  Yeah. Also, oh, yeah. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=591.6s)]
*  The ten thousand dollar. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=593.2s)]
*  I'm currently walking into New York. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=594.04s)]
*  I'm I would love to watch that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=595.76s)]
*  I saw a clip of it on Tiktok. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=597.44s)]
*  Affluent in Turkey, but not in USA. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=599.0s)]
*  Correct. Yes. You've talked about your privilege, your advantages, but you never act like [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  you are better as you want everyone to have access to good education and health care. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=603.64s)]
*  Yes. That is the whole point. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=606.72s)]
*  Also, people, people like lose their minds over the ship. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=609.2s)]
*  Like, yeah, I, you know, my, my father's like circumstances do not have any bearing on my [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=612.88s)]
*  political commentary whatsoever. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=619.84s)]
*  So that that in and of itself is also so stupid. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=621.64s)]
*  And it's just, I think, like a weird way to basically dox family members of a person that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=625.2s)]
*  you don't like. Like, but we've we've decided that, like, because the enemy is ontologically [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=629.64s)]
*  evil, me being the enemy, that's actually perfectly valid. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=635.0s)]
*  It's weird. Like, it's kind of it's kind of crazy that, like, that kind of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=638.52s)]
*  behavior is not considered psychopathic and scary and instead is is considered like [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  perfectly valid and normal and good. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=649.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, video of you talking about it from a while ago. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  Any number of different people who have not benefited from that intergenerational wealth. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=653.72s)]
*  My father is probably not going to leave me any money by the time he dies. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=657.64s)]
*  My grandfather, who I'm named after, he died and and left virtually no money. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=661.72s)]
*  He had tremendous wealth and almost had none left at the end of his life. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=669.08s)]
*  But it doesn't matter because he gave my father an incredible education, incredible [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=673.6s)]
*  opportunities, just like my father before me gave me those very same opportunities [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=679.48s)]
*  because. Hassan, I can't believe you admitted that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=684.36s)]
*  Hmm. On this video with 669000 views from June 15th, 2020. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=687.48s)]
*  Hmm. That sort of privilege does not come in the direct form of financial compensation. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=694.48s)]
*  You dumb f***. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=699.64s)]
*  In reality, the best path toward wealth in this country is income mobility, not [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  inherited wealth. This opened up a wealth. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=704.84s)]
*  OK, wait, I don't even disagree with that. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=706.9200000000001s)]
*  Income mobility. Would Ben Shapiro perhaps admit that income mobility is significantly [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=709.76s)]
*  affected by centuries of slavery and also segregation for another century after slavery [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=716.0s)]
*  was abolished? Maybe that's has something to do with the fact that black people don't [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=724.12s)]
*  have that same kind of income mobility in this country that white people do, which is [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=728.84s)]
*  the entire purpose of this video. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=732.12s)]
*  As a result, today, for every hundred dollars of wealth held by a white family, black [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=733.92s)]
*  families have five dollars and four cents. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=739.32s)]
*  A 2017 study confirms that redlining is still affecting home values in major cities like [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=742.2s)]
*  Chicago. This explains how Kevin and Jamal inherited vastly different circumstances. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=747.72s)]
*  As it turns out, there are some complicating factors that don't get cited in this video [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=753.44s)]
*  with regard to the state of the Federal Reserve. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=757.08s)]
*  The Twitter freak out of this morning about you is amazing. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=759.36s)]
*  Wait, why are people freaking out? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=763.36s)]
*  So it's really interesting. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=765.0s)]
*  It's really interesting that people, like I said, don't know that these are all things [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=767.4000000000001s)]
*  that I've addressed a million times over. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  My father grew up super wealthy as a pediatrician to upper class Esmina people and also lost [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=776.08s)]
*  it over his life. And at the end of his life, my dad was supporting him. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=779.8000000000001s)]
*  Do you think there's something in Turkish culture that makes people easily lose it like [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=781.92s)]
*  that? Haha. I don't know. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  Probably not. I think what a lot of people don't understand is that like I am I have [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  made more money than my dad ever has in his entire life. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  OK. And not only that, but I also take care of him now. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=794.88s)]
*  And I'm very fortunate to be able to do so. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=798.8s)]
*  And that still has not changed my analysis. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=801.12s)]
*  That still has not changed the things I fucking advocate for. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=804.0799999999999s)]
*  So I don't understand like, yeah, no, you can yell at me all day every day. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=807.12s)]
*  Be like, oh, you're rich and also socialist. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=810.8399999999999s)]
*  What the fuck? All this shit. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=813.3199999999999s)]
*  But that's it. Yeah. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=815.64s)]
*  Six billion dollars. My net worth is actually six billion dollars. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=817.16s)]
*  You guys joke about this shit, but like, honestly, people do believe it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=821.0799999999999s)]
*  So it's like a very weird situation. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  And I don't even want to talk. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=826.8s)]
*  I don't even want to talk about my fucking family. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=828.52s)]
*  It's like odd that people do this kind of shit, especially when I don't like, you know, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=830.4s)]
*  bring them on stream deliberately and make them the centerpiece or the focus of my [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=836.5999999999999s)]
*  of my commentary in general. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=842.8399999999999s)]
*  But once again, it always goes back to the same like false first principle, which is that like, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=844.8399999999999s)]
*  are you losing viewership? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=850.8399999999999s)]
*  No. Will there be a twenty twenty eight US election under Trump administrator? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=852.8s)]
*  Will there be a fair election in the USA? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=856.3599999999999s)]
*  I don't I don't know why you're my family has ten million euros. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=858.16s)]
*  And this, in fact, informs my politics. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=862.8399999999999s)]
*  Maybe understand that other people should have the benefits I had, for example, had a mental health [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=864.4399999999999s)]
*  crisis and was able to not work, stop university for a year and go back home. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=867.28s)]
*  Others would risk death or or complete poverty in that position. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=870.64s)]
*  Exactly. That's another thing. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=873.68s)]
*  That is also another side of the story as well is like, like, like, for example, my experience going from [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  working for a company as a wage laborer to working for myself in the process of still, you know, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=882.88s)]
*  making him making money from real estate that way would only put him behind Rick Caruso on the list of [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=890.64s)]
*  Forbes real estate billionaires from twenty twenty three, which is an insane claim to make. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=896.52s)]
*  Yeah, people are on crack cocaine, I think. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=900.24s)]
*  But but look, the point I was trying to make is that like all of the opportunity that I've had, all of the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=903.68s)]
*  privilege that I've had, I want others to be able to have that as well. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=911.56s)]
*  I want others to be able to experience the freedom of not having to fucking worry about health care costs. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=914.9200000000001s)]
*  That's it. That's what I advocate for. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=921.2800000000001s)]
*  OK. And I've never really personally kid my beginnings or anything like that. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=923.4s)]
*  Not that it bears any basis on my commentary in general. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=930.2s)]
*  And I think it's really weird and it's a very odd way to just like try to open up a new vector of attack by [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=934.2800000000001s)]
*  just like doxing my family. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  What the fuck? It's the weird and gross. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=942.92s)]
*  I don't know how else to describe it. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=946.56s)]
*  Yes, a little bit. I'm aware that Coke is officially on the BDS list. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=948.16s)]
*  I know. But yeah, apparently people got real mad at the it all comes from Destiny followers. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=952.76s)]
*  Yeah, probably two hours in and he hasn't covered news. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=957.32s)]
*  It's an hour and twenty five. OK. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=959.88s)]
*  But yeah, the one of the weirdest aspects of this is literally when I start talking about the stuff, it's the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=963.0s)]
*  same principle. It's the same like. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=968.16s)]
*  It's the same reasons as to why people will start talking about like, well, Coke is on the BDS list, which [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=971.04s)]
*  means that, you know, I'm going to decide all these other things are also on the BDS list and make sure that [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=976.0799999999999s)]
*  you don't consume them or something. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=981.16s)]
*  It's that parasocial. It's that little parasocial puppeteering interest that a lot of people have that that [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=983.92s)]
*  basically start changing the dynamic of the chat. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=991.16s)]
*  And it's really interesting because like I saw people in the chat being like, what's your net worth and how do you [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=995.16s)]
*  plan on spending it? It's like, dude, what the fuck are you saying? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=998.9200000000001s)]
*  Anyway, excuse me, can you please give me a financial accounting of all of your expenses right now so I can [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1001.88s)]
*  make assessments on whether it's moral by my standards or not is not a, you know, this fucking ridiculous [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1006.84s)]
*  convo to have. It is. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1013.12s)]
*  It's especially ridiculous because people will be like, oh, he's hiding it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1014.72s)]
*  He's being sinister. It's like, dude, what are you talking about? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1017.6s)]
*  I exhibit or I live under capitalism in the most ethical ways possible. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1020.24s)]
*  OK, within the bounds of reason. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1026.28s)]
*  And people still fucking yell at me for leasing a goddamn dentist car like the Taycan or [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1028.96s)]
*  person, a house that I mortgaged so that I could live with it and welcome all of my family [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1035.76s)]
*  members and also people that are from all around the world come and visit Los Angeles. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1042.48s)]
*  And not only that, but even then, people yell about that. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1048.84s)]
*  Why the fuck would I constantly play defense on this shit? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1052.0s)]
*  Yeah, whatever, dude, I'm caked up. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1054.68s)]
*  OK, focus on the argument. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1056.28s)]
*  That's it. It's another way to just move the conversation away from that, to just like attack the attack, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1058.0s)]
*  the person saying the message and not necessarily the message itself. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1063.68s)]
*  Oh, there must be some inconsistency here. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1067.24s)]
*  OK, anyway, yes, I will be streaming tomorrow and Jenks giving us tomorrow. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1070.28s)]
*  Yeah, every moment that you're like, oh, dude, I can't believe this house is fucking to seven [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1075.56s)]
*  mil is a moment where you're not asking the question, why is that house to point seven mil? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1080.6799999999998s)]
*  That's, I think, a much more productive conversation to be having. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1085.56s)]
*  Now, let's get back to the real news of the world. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pKlIzPaPY&t=1090.1599999999999s)]
