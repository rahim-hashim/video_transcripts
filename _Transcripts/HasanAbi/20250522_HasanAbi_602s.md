**HasanAbi:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0)
*  Turn the lights down. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=0.0s)]
*  Armed with unsourced videos and news articles. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=1.3s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=6.3s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=6.8s)]
*  Clown show. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=8.9s)]
*  Clown show. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=10.5s)]
*  Clown show. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=12.0s)]
*  Every... [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Every global leader will be ritualistically humiliated, okay? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=14.8s)]
*  I'm skipping that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=24.3s)]
*  It's like every other goddamn day, who cares? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=25.2s)]
*  President Trump has tense exchange with South Africa's president in the Oval Office. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=27.8s)]
*  We watched it live. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=31.4s)]
*  I'm going to use this as a refresher, and then I'm going to go into a lot of the things that he brought up, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=32.5s)]
*  including the clip compie that he brought up in the process of owning the South African president in the marketplace of ideas. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=38.3s)]
*  Turning now to the fallout from another tense meeting between President Trump and a foreign leader that took an unexpected turn. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=44.7s)]
*  This time, the president accused South Africa's president of allowing against white farmers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=51.0s)]
*  The claim that is not supported by any evidence. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=55.8s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  It's just like... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=61.4s)]
*  He just made it up, dude. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=63.099999999999994s)]
*  Like, a bunch of Nazis made it up, and he just went along with it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=64.5s)]
*  Insane. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=69.0s)]
*  Total insanity. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=69.8s)]
*  Zhang is at the White House, Ouija. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=71.39999999999999s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=73.2s)]
*  Hey, good morning, Nate. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=74.5s)]
*  Good morning to everybody. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=75.4s)]
*  South Africa's president came here with a delegation of professional golfers and businessmen ready to talk about trade and investment. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=76.5s)]
*  But the meeting quickly turned into a showdown, as President Trump claimed the leader was allowing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=84.6s)]
*  It started as a friendly meeting. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=91.0s)]
*  It's a great honor to be with the president of South Africa. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=93.5s)]
*  But when South African president Ciro Ramaphosa denied unsubstantiated claims in his country, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  President Trump dove into a prepared response. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=105.0s)]
*  Turn the lights down. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=108.3s)]
*  Armed with unsourced videos and news articles. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=109.69999999999999s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  Clown show. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=117.0s)]
*  Clown show. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=118.1s)]
*  Clown show. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=119.5s)]
*  Every... [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  Every global leader will be ritualistically humiliated, okay? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=122.3s)]
*  Trump accused Ramaphosa's government of seizing land and allowing white South African farmers to be persecuted. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=126.8s)]
*  You're taking people's land away from them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  And those people, in many cases, are being executed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=139.0s)]
*  They're being executed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  And they happen to be white. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=143.9s)]
*  And most of them happen to be farmers. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  Earlier this month, Trump welcomed dozens of white South Africans to the U.S., [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=147.6s)]
*  giving them refugee status and claiming they were victims of racial discrimination. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=152.6s)]
*  Whether they're white or black makes no difference to me, but white farmers are being brutally killed. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=157.8s)]
*  But data shows there is no evidence of targeted violence against white people who own more than half of the farmland. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  The country yet make up less than 10% of the population. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=171.9s)]
*  And while crime rates are high in South Africa, Ramaphosa pushed back against Trump's claim saying it's not racially motivated. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=175.8s)]
*  People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only white people. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=183.9s)]
*  Trump was asked if he's concluded is happening. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=192.5s)]
*  Well, I haven't made up my mind. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  After leaving the White House, Ramaphosa made his position clear. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=197.3s)]
*  There is just no in South Africa. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=201.6s)]
*  During that Oval Office meeting, President Trump became angry when a reporter asked about the defense secretary [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=204.9s)]
*  formally accepting a $400 million jet from Qatar that Trump wants to use as Air Force One. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=210.7s)]
*  A spokesman says the Pentagon will work to ensure there are proper security measures and mission requirements. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=217.2s)]
*  But many lawmakers on both sides questioned the safety and legality of accepting that plane. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=222.7s)]
*  Gail? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=228.9s)]
*  All right, Weijia, thank you very much. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=229.7s)]
*  You would have seen a video played in the Oval Office. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=231.6s)]
*  All right, so this is the the first fact check. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=234.7s)]
*  Okay, even if this was happening, I'd be like fair Haitian Revolution was absolutely justified. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not happening. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=243.4s)]
*  There is no entertaining of this happening. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  And no, it's like the what's happening has what's happening is is well what has started. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  To happen was the talks the consideration of purchasing farmland for market price. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay, purchasing farmland for market price. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=267.4s)]
*  It hasn't even begun yet. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=271.8s)]
*  And the reason for why that must happen, which by the way is a constitutionally protected, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=273.4s)]
*  That came after the dissolution of the and it just never happened to to take place. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=287.0s)]
*  Imminent domain for the sake of reparations. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=287.7s)]
*  That's the scariest sentence ever for white people. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=289.5s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  In the meeting between President Sular Ramaphosa and his delegation from South Africa, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=293.0s)]
*  who met with our US counterpart President Donald Trump. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  The video shown by the White House of things including statements made by EFF leader or commander in chief Julius Malema [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=301.4s)]
*  as well as former President Jacob Zuma. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=309.2s)]
*  But the one thing that President Trump touched on was a video that was taken from the sky in a helicopter [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=312.8s)]
*  and it showed a road and crosses on either side of this road as hundreds if not thousands of vehicles lined this road. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=319.8s)]
*  Those people are all killed. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=330.2s)]
*  Have they told you where that is Mr. President? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=332.5s)]
*  No, I'd like to know where that is. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=336.3s)]
*  Now that video was taken in September 2020. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=338.3s)]
*  It was taken on a rural road in the Normandine area, which is in northern KwaZulu Natal in an area known as Newcastle. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=343.1s)]
*  And that video was taken in response to a murder that was committed earlier that week. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=351.6s)]
*  On August 30th, 2020, Glen and Vida Rafati, a progressive couple in the Normandine area were at their farm. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  They were killed along with their dog as intruders entered their home and ransacked their place and stole a number of items and goods before fleeing in Glen's vehicle. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=367.1s)]
*  The vehicle was found later abandoned and two years later, subsequently three people were arrested and charged with the murder as well as robbery with aggravating circumstances and sentenced respectively. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=376.8s)]
*  But that specific protest you saw in the video, right, was a multiracial protest. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=389.6s)]
*  According to the Institute for Race Relations, who were there on the day of the protest, the protest took place the following weekend on September the 5th, the Saturday. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=396.1s)]
*  And this was in response to people trying to make government aware of the plight of farmers in the country and trying to raise awareness around farm murders. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=405.8s)]
*  Now, Glen and Vida were on August 30th on a Sunday. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=416.8s)]
*  On Wednesday, September 2nd, the former Minister for Police, Becky Kehle, together with Fani Massimola, met with a raft in Normandine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=420.6s)]
*  I was there. I was a reporter in KwaZulu Natal at the time. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=430.1s)]
*  I attended that meeting that Kehle had with the family as well as an open engagement and dialogue that he had with farmers as well as farm workers in the community. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  So there was a response from South Africa and the government to that specific incident. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=444.8s)]
*  Kehle saying at the time that there had been about seven murders within that area in probably a year. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=450.5s)]
*  And of those seven murders, they had made basically arrests in every case. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=459.1s)]
*  So there was attention being given to it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=464.5s)]
*  You only see negative things about farm murders and politicians and everything else on TV. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=466.70000000000005s)]
*  And this is an experience I don't wish on anybody, but I experience has been very positive. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=472.90000000000003s)]
*  The police have been amazing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  It's just nice to know that the senseless murder of our friends has been taken seriously. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=479.7s)]
*  There's claims that each cross on either side of the road represents people who are in farm attacks. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=486.5s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=493.2s)]
*  The organizers who the Institute for Race Relations spoke to at the time said they were merely just trying to raise awareness. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=494.7s)]
*  And those crosses were just trying to raise attention as to the plight of farm workers and the dangerous conditions they live in. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  But our crime stats clearly show that there's no white happening in South Africa and specifically targeting farmers. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=509.7s)]
*  Last year in the third quarter of 2024, 12 farmers were committed in South Africa. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=517.1s)]
*  And these were farm workers as well. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=525.0s)]
*  Of those 12, and bearing in mind that 7,000 people were in the third quarter of 2024, only one was a farm owner. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=528.2s)]
*  The rest were farm workers. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=536.3s)]
*  The rest were people who lived on small holdings and rural areas that can be considered as farm holdings. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  It must also be noted that President Donald Trump held up a number of articles claiming to show white happening in South Africa. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=544.3s)]
*  Some of these articles weren't even from South African media or reputable media houses in South Africa. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=553.3s)]
*  One article we looked at was published from the DRC. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=559.0999999999999s)]
*  It didn't have anything to do with South Africa. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zr7a2OwoF0&t=562.5999999999999s)]
