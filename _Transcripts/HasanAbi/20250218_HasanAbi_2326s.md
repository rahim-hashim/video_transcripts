# Trump’s Insane Remarks At Mar-a-Lago Executive Order Signing | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk)
*  No, he did. Oh my God. He literally said Ukraine started it. What the I think he's talking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=0.0s)]
*  about you being upset that they hadn't been invited. I mean, he's literally saying you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  should have, you should have never started it. I, is he talking about the EU or is he [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=9.92s)]
*  talking about, which by the way, I don't even know. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=14.8s)]
*  I don't even know if this is like, okay, this is crazy. This, Oh my God. Oh my God, bro. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=18.32s)]
*  This is crazy. What the fuck? Yo, Donald Trump is saying shit that all of my haters think [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=24.56s)]
*  Twitter is not just worse because it's all also I like that you admit that it's just, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=37.96s)]
*  you know, Caesar right wing. So I'm glad that you at least come to that recognition because [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  it's not just right wingers. It's quite literally. Okay. Like Adolf Hitler ads and stuff. Okay. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=47.36s)]
*  So on that front, it's qualitatively worse. Yes. But that's not even what I was talking [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=54.84s)]
*  about when I said Twitter is actually worse. Now I'm talking about like the trending tab. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=60.06s)]
*  Yeah. He's really dude. Really? Yeah. Not season air quotes. Like what, what does a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=66.2s)]
*  dude have to say? They sick high regularly on there, man. What are you talking about? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=76.0s)]
*  If those guys aren't these, who's a Nazi? Nobody's a Nazi. Adolf Hitler is not a Nazi [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=80.96s)]
*  is what you're basically arriving at, at this point. What the hell? There is no way you [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=86.52s)]
*  are this. Yeah. Hundreds of millions of now Twitter is not used by hundreds of millions [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=91.63999999999999s)]
*  of Americans. You it doesn't even have 20% of the entire, like, no, no hundreds of millions [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=96.05999999999999s)]
*  of these. Yeah. No, you you're in your fantasy. It's hundreds of millions of American Patriots [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  that are now rushing to use Twitter. That's not the case. Okay. It's user base has actually [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=108.02s)]
*  diminished since the Elon Musk takeover. Okay. God damn you are so dumb. Yeah. The, the only [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=112.46s)]
*  extra motion on Twitter is now just bots. Okay. I wonder what this relatively small [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=119.98s)]
*  account that Elon Musk follows is. Oh, I see it just post porn and Nazism only. Yeah. Great [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=124.9s)]
*  stuff. He's like, Oh, excuse me. Is this really a Nazi account? Yes. The answer is yes. Okay. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes. They're posting swastikas. Yes. Wow. Look at this small account that Elon Musk [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=141.26s)]
*  follows. Hmm. It's not subtle. This account tweets and retweets constantly about things [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=146.5s)]
*  like not wanting to hear our worded blacks and their are worded opinions. They need to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=151.1s)]
*  make America blonde again. How America should be a white nation and celebrates Trump as [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=155.61999999999998s)]
*  a second coming of Hitler. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=158.82s)]
*  Make South Africa white again. Make America blonde again. Really cool stuff. Wow. Are [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  you really saying? Yeah. What's next? Isan. Are you going to say that this ad from Nixon [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  Groyper is a Nazi ad? Imagine being born a Gentile in this generation on this continent [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=175.54s)]
*  located on an ocean away from Europe and viscerally hating this one foreign dictator from 80 years [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=181.82s)]
*  ago for no reason other than my teacher showed me Schindler's list or the museum tour guide [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=186.45999999999998s)]
*  told us he burned Jews. He turned Jews into soap and still believing at the age of 30 [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=190.1s)]
*  or 40. Lamau. It's time to start reevaluating your perspective of history. That's just a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=193.86s)]
*  pro Hitler ad. Here's a pro Hitler guy responding to Kyle Kalinsky posting the pro Hitler ad [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=199.34s)]
*  and going Elon site now has ads for Adolf Hitler going. People are just asking questions [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=205.94s)]
*  and rightfully so Nixon Groyper. I don't understand was Nazi about that. Just curious. Just asking [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  questions. Anyway, let's watch this other talk about his new executive orders before [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=217.22s)]
*  I get back to all of the government incompetence. Here, I guess we can take a couple of quick [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=224.22s)]
*  questions. Go ahead, please. Please. What the auto tariff rate should be. Yeah, I probably [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  will tell you that in on April 2nd, but it'll be in the neighborhood of 25 percent. It'll [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=240.74s)]
*  be 25 percent and higher and it'll go very substantially higher over course of a year, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=249.3s)]
*  but we want to give them time to come in because as you know, when they come into the United [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=254.9s)]
*  States and they have their here, there is no tariff. So we want to give them a little [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=258.58s)]
*  bit of a chance. Yes. Thank you. The EU representative is going to be here this week. I'm sorry, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=264.48s)]
*  tomorrow he's going to be meeting with Greer and let Nick. What can the EU do to sort of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  avoid the reciprocal tariffs that you've talked about? And you know, you've talked a lot about [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=280.8s)]
*  the VAT. Do you expect them to reduce that? Well, they did already, as I understand it, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=285.8s)]
*  reduce their car tariff all the way down to what we have. And a lot of that will take [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=292.48s)]
*  place and I think some won't do it and some will do it. But the EU had a 10 percent tax [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=296.16s)]
*  on cars and now they have a two and a half percent tax, which is the exact same. Please [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  a little louder. I can't believe you guys want to hear Trump. But you got it. That would [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=303.78000000000003s)]
*  be great. If everybody would do that, then we'd all be on the same playing field because [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  essentially what we're doing with the tariffs is, you know, they charge us, we charge them [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  same amount. And it's called reciprocal, actually. And whatever they charge us, we're charging [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=316.32s)]
*  them. And so the EU is, you know, I appreciate that they did this, but you know, the EU has [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=323.32s)]
*  been very unfair to us. We have a deficit of $350 billion. They don't take our cars. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=328.64s)]
*  They don't take our farm products. They don't take almost anything. They take very little. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=334.08s)]
*  And we're going to have to straighten that out. And we will. I have no doubt about it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=339.66s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, please. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=344.16s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. Can you tell us a little bit more about the Russia talks, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=345.16s)]
*  your impression of how they went today and if you're perhaps more confident or less [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=350.6s)]
*  confident of the deal after what happened today? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=353.8s)]
*  Well, much more confident. They were very good. Russia wants to do something. They want [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=356.48s)]
*  to stop the savage barbarianism. I mean, what's going on over there? It's soldiers are being [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=361.24s)]
*  killed by the thousands on a weekly basis. It's ridiculous. And they're not American [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=369.2s)]
*  soldiers. They're Russian soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers largely, although a lot [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=374.68s)]
*  of Koreans have been as you know, quite a bit of them have been. They came over to fight [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  and a large portion have been wiped out. But we want to we want to end it. It was it's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  a senseless war. It should have never happened, would have never happened if I was president. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=390.12s)]
*  And it's a shame to see it. And I see pictures that you don't see, but I see pictures of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=395.3s)]
*  fields that look hard, just horrible. It looks like Gettysburg. If you see the old pictures [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  of Gettysburg, it's soldiers lying all over the field, body parts all over the field. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  They're all dead. And this is going on on a daily basis. It's a horrible thing. Both [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=407.86s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine. They're losing thousands and thousands of soldiers. And a lot of people [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=413.5s)]
*  have been killed too. I think that's one of the things that you'll see historically and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=419.14s)]
*  you'll see later on as it goes along. I think people are going to be surprised at how many [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=423.70000000000005s)]
*  people not only soldiers have been killed in Ukraine. A lot more people than you think. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=427.62s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  President Trump, as part of a peace deal with Putin, would you be willing to consider removing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  all American troops from Europe? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=442.58000000000004s)]
*  Well nobody's asked me to do that. So I don't think we'd have to do that. I wouldn't want [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  to do that. But that question's never really come up. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=449.86s)]
*  Yeah. Please. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=454.86s)]
*  Sir, do you support stationing European peacekeeping troops in Ukraine as part of this peace deal? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=455.86s)]
*  If they want to do that, that's great. I'm all for it. If they want to do that, I think [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=464.38s)]
*  that'd be fine. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=468.7s)]
*  I mean, I know France has mentioned it. Others have mentioned it. UK has mentioned it. But [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=471.06s)]
*  yeah, well, if we have a peace deal, I think having troops over there from the standpoint [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=476.58000000000004s)]
*  of Europe, we won't have to put any over there because we're very far away. But having troops [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=482.26000000000005s)]
*  over there would be fine. I would not object to it at all. We're talking about this now. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=488.18s)]
*  Peace. We have either a ceasefire or a peace itself. And we're looking to do both. We'd [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=492.94s)]
*  start off with the ceasefire. And if they want to do that. I know France was willing [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=499.06s)]
*  to do that. And I thought that was a beautiful gesture. Yeah, please. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=504.70000000000005s)]
*  Sir, do you have any message for Ukrainians who, after three years of fighting, might [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=507.90000000000003s)]
*  feel betrayed or disappointed at not having a seat at these initial talks in Saudi Arabia? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=512.02s)]
*  Well, I think I'm really disappointed in what's happened. I've been watching this for three [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=516.62s)]
*  years. It's a w-t that would have never happened if I was president. And I've been watching [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=523.1800000000001s)]
*  these people being c-t-ed at levels that you've rarely seen. Not even close since the second [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=527.4200000000001s)]
*  world war. And I'm very disappointed. I hear that, you know, they're upset about not having [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=534.78s)]
*  a seat. Well, they've had a seat for three years. And a long time before that. This could [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=539.62s)]
*  have been settled very easily. Just a half-baked negotiator could have settled this years ago. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=543.9399999999999s)]
*  Without I think without the loss of much land, very little land, without the loss of any [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=553.26s)]
*  lives and without the loss of cities that are just laying on their side, you have those [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=558.66s)]
*  magnificent golden domes that are shattered, will never be replaced. You can't replace [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=563.9599999999999s)]
*  them. Thousand-year-old domes that are so beautiful. You can't replace that. The whole [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  civilization has changed because of what's so- When they're worried about not being [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  seated, you mean somebody that should have gone in and made a deal a long time ago. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=579.5999999999999s)]
*  You could have made a deal. This is one that could have made a deal. There was no talk [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=585.28s)]
*  of this during the Trump administration. Putin would have never, ever done it. And by the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=588.64s)]

*  either in Israel. Another great deal for Trump. And we wouldn't have had that mess that's [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=598.24s)]
*  going on over there. He's Mr. Dealmaker. We have great fire people here. We're putting [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  out fires all over the world. So that wouldn't have happened. And you know what else wouldn't [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  have happened? Inflation. Because it was caused really by the cost of energy going through [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=609.84s)]
*  the roof because of their bad energy policies. And also their spending, their terrible spending, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=614.74s)]
*  on the Green New Scam. It's a scam. It's a whole big scam. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=621.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's where the wasteful spending was. Once again- [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=624.48s)]
*  I want to ask you a little closer to home. What would it take for you to reconsider the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=626.36s)]
*  restrictions on the Associated Press? And secondly, some of your advisors are concerned [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  with the Associated Press's style guide, using language and giving guidance to not use words [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=636.62s)]
*  like illegal immigrant or to use phrases like gender-affirming care. And they're concerned [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  about that being an encroaching amount of liberalism in the way in which the press writes [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=648.16s)]
*  about things. Do you share those concerns? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=652.4s)]
*  Well, I do think that some of the phrases that they want to use are ridiculous. And [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=654.04s)]
*  I think, frankly, they become obsolete, especially in the last three weeks, because many things [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=659.64s)]
*  have happened in the last three weeks. And I didn't know about that, but I would say [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=665.02s)]
*  that if they want to use certain phrases like that- and I guess some are okay, but [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=670.24s)]
*  many aren't- but the Associated Press just refuses to go with what the law is and what [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=674.3399999999999s)]
*  is taking place. It's called the Gulf of America now. It's not called the Gulf of Mexico any [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=680.18s)]
*  longer. I have the right to do it, just like we have the right to do Mount McKinley, and [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=686.54s)]
*  nobody's even challenging that. But only the Associated-essentially, it's primarily the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=690.2199999999999s)]
*  Associated Press. And I don't know what they're doing, but I just say that we're going to [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=695.0999999999999s)]
*  keep them out until such time as they agree that it's the Gulf of America. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=698.8199999999999s)]
*  Isn't it insane? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=702.2199999999999s)]
*  It is one of the dumbest- it is one of the stupidest ways to do a government censorship, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=703.62s)]
*  by the way. Just truly, truly one of the stupidest things that has happened in an otherwise incredibly [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=708.82s)]
*  stupid administration, for the record. And the very fact that, like, other members of the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=716.94s)]
*  media are not freaking out over this, or the very fact that the Mr. Free Speech defenders [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=721.6600000000001s)]
*  on the right are not freaking out over this, is very telling. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=727.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=731.62s)]
*  We're hearing that Russia wants to force Ukraine to hold new elections in order to sign any [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=732.62s)]
*  kind of a peace deal. Is that something that the US would ever support? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=737.46s)]
*  Well, we have a situation where we haven't had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=741.42s)]
*  law, essentially martial law in Ukraine. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=748.82s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder why- come on, dude. Like, as critical as I am, like, come on. I wonder [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=751.58s)]
*  why they didn't have elections in Ukraine. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=756.7s)]
*  Blown to smithereens. You got- most of the cities are laying on their sides. The buildings [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=759.9s)]
*  are collapsed. It looks like a massive demolition site. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=766.1s)]
*  Wow, I can't- no way. They had- [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=769.5s)]
*  So many of the- [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=771.26s)]
*  No way. They had martial law in Ukraine? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=772.26s)]
*  Yeah, but they don't want to have any rockets in there. They've done it since. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=773.9s)]
*  What happened? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=777.5s)]
*  100% if they want to. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=778.5s)]
*  I wonder what happened in Ukraine that caused them to have martial law. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=779.5s)]
*  That are absolutely desperate. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=783.1s)]
*  Okay. And before people say there were elections during World War II, please, dude. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=784.9s)]
*  Please. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=789.5s)]
*  The people have to- [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=790.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=791.5s)]
*  The people of Ukraine have to say, like, you know, it's been a long time since we've had [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=792.5s)]
*  an election. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=795.94s)]
*  It is one of the few instances where it is permissible not to hold elections, okay? Like, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=796.94s)]
*  come on. Come on, chatters. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=803.54s)]
*  It's literally- these cities look like Gaza. Actually, many have, percentage-wise, more [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=806.62s)]
*  buildings knocked down. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=813.18s)]
*  Ironically enough, if Donald Trump actually was not a moron and wanted to talk about, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=814.18s)]
*  like, the illiberal aspects of Ukraine, he would talk about, like, banning leftist parties [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=819.9799999999999s)]
*  under the auspices of saying that they're pro-Russia, okay? That, on its own, again, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=824.9399999999999s)]
*  is a thing that the American government has also done in times of war, ironically enough. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=832.38s)]
*  But that is, in my opinion, a greater indication of lack of liberalism, regardless of, you [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=838.02s)]
*  know, regardless of the war, the unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine or not. But he doesn't [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=848.06s)]
*  fucking care about that because that would require him to assume a stance that is openly [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=854.62s)]
*  partisan for leftist ideology, I guess. Okay? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=860.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=864.5s)]
*  He's given $100 billion, and we've given, let's say, $300 plus, and it's more important [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=865.5s)]
*  for them than it is for us. We have an ocean in between, and they don't. But where is all [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=870.78s)]
*  the money that's been given? Where is it going? And nobody- I've never seen an accounting [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=876.78s)]
*  of it. We give hundreds of billions of dollars. I don't see any accounting. So- [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=880.78s)]
*  He's talking about Ukraine like he talks about Hamas? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=886.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=888.78s)]
*  You know why I want- [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=889.78s)]
*  He is brutally honest about American foreign policy. American foreign policy literally [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=890.78s)]
*  discards most of our allies, okay? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=896.14s)]
*  And I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it's going very well. But today [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=899.54s)]
*  I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. Well, you've been there for three years. You should [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=904.42s)]
*  have ended it three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=907.5799999999999s)]
*  I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=911.6999999999999s)]
*  everything, almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed and no city [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=917.66s)]
*  would have been demolished and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=921.2199999999999s)]
*  not to do it that way. And President Biden in all fairness- [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=925.9399999999999s)]
*  Did he just say Ukraine started the war? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=928.3s)]
*  He was so bad for this. He was so bad. So pathetic. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=930.5799999999999s)]
*  Did I misunderstand what he was saying? Hold on. I got to run it back. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=933.54s)]
*  Yeah, but we- [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=936.54s)]
*  ...that are being killed. And they're- we give hundreds of billions of dollars. I have- [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=937.54s)]
*  I don't see any accounting. So I want a sea peace. Look, you know why I want? Because [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=946.18s)]
*  I don't want all these people killed anymore. I'm looking at people that are being killed. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=950.7399999999999s)]
*  And they're Russian and Ukrainian people, but they're people. Doesn't matter where they're [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=955.9399999999999s)]
*  from on the whole planet. And I think I have the power to end this war. And I think it's [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=959.7399999999999s)]
*  going very well. But today I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. Well, you've been there [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=965.64s)]
*  for three years. You should have ended it three years. You should have never started [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=969.5s)]
*  it. You could have made a deal. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=973.06s)]
*  No, he did. Oh my God. He literally said Ukraine started it. What the fuck? I think he's talking [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=974.9s)]
*  about you being upset that they hadn't been invited. I mean, he's literally saying you [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=980.18s)]
*  should have, you should have never started it. I, is he talking about the EU or is he [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=984.5799999999999s)]
*  talking about, which by the way, I don't even know. I don't even know if this is like, okay, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=989.4599999999999s)]
*  this is crazy. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=995.38s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh my God, bro. This is crazy. What the fuck? Yo, Donald Trump is saying [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=996.78s)]
*  shit that all of my haters think I say all the time. Okay. But he just, that is the president [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1005.1s)]
*  of the United States of America saying shit that most people online, most liberals online [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1013.42s)]
*  assume is my position on Ukraine. This is an insane thing to state, especially as the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1020.54s)]
*  president of the United States of America, like Ukraine in this circumstance is the least [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1025.38s)]
*  responsible party for being invaded. I would go so far as to say that even American interference [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1031.2600000000002s)]
*  probably played more of a role than Ukraine in terms of who started it. Okay. The number [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1038.1000000000001s)]
*  one responsible party is Russia. Okay. Obviously they fucking invaded the country. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1045.74s)]
*  And Ukraine is not even remotely responsible for this. Sorry, that's ridiculous. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1052.3400000000001s)]
*  And neither is Europe. Europe just literally listens to the United States of America. What [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1062.2600000000002s)]
*  the fuck is this take? That is crazy. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1066.0200000000002s)]
*  They chose not to do it that way. And President Biden, in all fairness, he doesn't have a clue [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1081.38s)]
*  what he, he was so bad for this. He was so bad, so pathetic, so sad. But with all of [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1085.6200000000001s)]
*  that being said, look, we, it is what it is. When I left, there was no chance that this [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1092.74s)]
*  could have happened, but it happened because we had incompetent leadership at many different [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1097.14s)]
*  levels. But when you see what's taken place in Ukraine with millions of people killed, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1100.9s)]
*  including the soldiers, millions of people killed, a big percentage of their cities knocked [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1107.14s)]
*  down to the ground. I don't know how anybody even lives there. You know, when they say [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1112.3400000000001s)]
*  they took a poll and Zelensky is at 4%, who's living there? You know, I mean, people are, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1115.38s)]
*  it's hard to believe. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1120.74s)]
*  This chat is so funny. If China was working with Mexico to encroach on our borders, we [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1121.74s)]
*  wouldn't invade. Dog, you're saying that right now. Donald Trump is unironically saying that. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1124.9s)]
*  Like, he hasn't gotten to that part of the equation yet. He just says, oh, he has to [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1132.74s)]
*  tackle the cartel or whatever. But like, yeah, this administration has a lot of appetite for [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1136.18s)]
*  bombing Mexico. Okay. And my answer is no, we shouldn't bomb Mexico, let alone fucking [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1140.42s)]

*  that this is something that should have never happened, would have never happened. And I used [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1218.74s)]

*  I just said, just write it down, just in case that question got asked, right? And which I'm surprised [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1281.3000000000002s)]
*  it took so long, actually. But you know what? Ukraine's a bigger deal because people are dying [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1286.9s)]
*  by the thousands a week. Thousands. But look at this. From 90 to 99, Social Security. Six million [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1293.3000000000002s)]

*  99. Maybe it's possible. It's a lot of people, though, with that. But people that live to 100 to [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1308.5s)]
*  109, 4,734,000. Wow, that's a lot. That means over 100 years old, they're four million people. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1314.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know too many. I know people that are doing great in their 90s, but not too many [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1321.9399999999998s)]
*  people over 100. But over 120, from 120 years old, people that are 120 years old up to 129, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1326.82s)]
*  three million four hundred and seventy two thousand people. Wow. You know, that can't possibly be [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1338.9s)]
*  because the record is like, I think it's one person, a woman, lived to 127, but they have [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1344.42s)]

*  I haven't even gotten to this part of the broadcast yet, which I'm going to talk about in a little bit. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1356.34s)]

*  People from 150 years old to 159 years old, one million three hundred and forty five thousand. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1386.82s)]

*  The worst part about this is just like the government is run by incompetent morons. OK, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1400.26s)]
*  and they're just actively lying and people don't have any critical thinking skills and quite [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1405.62s)]
*  literally just go, that makes sense. Yeah, I hate the government and my favorite guy is just saying [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1411.54s)]
*  this and he's saying it in a way that like agrees with my existing biases. So I'm going to believe [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1417.06s)]
*  him. Fuck you. They're super. I asked, Elon, who are these Doge people? He said they're super [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1422.5s)]
*  brilliant computer people and they love the country. It's simple. Wait a minute. People from [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1429.22s)]

*  interpretation of the data. OK, that's just a little bit of critical thinking. OK, so clearly, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1511.38s)]
*  I guess in this instance and just this instance alone, the answer is yes. OK, that's it. That's it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1518.5800000000002s)]

*  from a time when Social Security as a concept didn't exist. OK, the idea that someone has been [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1536.1000000000001s)]
*  getting paid Social Security payments for a longer period of time than the existence of Social Security [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1543.38s)]

*  we do in the schools, aren't they? 2 million dollars to develop sustainable recycling models [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1891.78s)]
*  to increase socioeconomic cohesion among marginalized communities in Kosovo and Eshkali. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1896.5s)]
*  And in Egypt, we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars. I could, I could, by the way, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1905.7s)]
*  I could read this all day long. I could go on all day long and you'll see hundreds of billions of [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1912.98s)]
*  dollars and we're doing it. But when I saw the social security numbers, I said, wow, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1919.86s)]
*  that's really something. So we have, let's just go above 100 years old. We have millions and millions [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1926.74s)]
*  of people over 100 years old. Everybody knows that's not so. We have a very corrupt country, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1933.62s)]
*  very corrupt country, and it's a sad thing to say, but we're figuring it out. Now, the good thing [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1940.34s)]
*  about social security and what I read is if you take all of those numbers off, because they're [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1944.9799999999998s)]
*  obviously fraudulent or incompetent, but if you take all of those millions of people off social [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1949.3s)]
*  security, all of a sudden we have a very powerful social security with people that are 80 and 70 and [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1953.4599999999998s)]
*  90, but not 200 years old. You know, so it's a very positive thing. How about over here? Go, please. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1958.1799999999998s)]
*  The question is, okay, had resigning after the... [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1963.62s)]
*  Who resigned? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1965.4599999999998s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, resigned or got fired? I think got fired. You know, when you fire somebody, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1967.4599999999998s)]
*  they always resign and then they say, we resigned. But when you have numbers like that, I think [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1971.3s)]
*  really it's got fired. They have to get fired. Who would keep them? How could you have numbers [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1974.7399999999998s)]
*  like this? Now, the big thing is how many of these people got paid? Were they getting paid? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1979.3799999999999s)]
*  Were they getting paid? How many of them were getting paid social security because of fraud? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1983.4599999999998s)]
*  We'll have to call those Great Palm Beach police into this situation, right? You guys would figure [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1986.02s)]
*  that out very quickly. But how many of them are being paid? I mean, maybe millions of them. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1989.1399999999999s)]
*  But it's a total fraud. Also, a lot of illegal immigrants are in social security. They shouldn't [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1993.62s)]
*  be there. Yeah, please go ahead. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1996.9799999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a big wave of probationary federal workers who were fired over the weekend. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=1998.5s)]
*  Some of these workers focused on nuclear weapon security, were immediately rehired. Do you have [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2001.4599999999998s)]
*  any concerns about how these terminations... [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2004.82s)]
*  No, not at all. I think we have to just do what we have to do. It's amazing what's been found [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2006.1s)]
*  right now. It's amazing. If we feel that... [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2010.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so amazing what's been found. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2013.06s)]
*  ...in some cases, the Bible will put some people back. Not all of them, because a lot of people [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2014.26s)]
*  were let go. Don't forget, I got elected on the basis of making our government stronger and smaller [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2016.58s)]
*  because we have millions of people that, obviously, they're paying millions of people [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2021.3s)]
*  that shouldn't be paid. And that has also to do with workers. Yeah, please. No, go ahead. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2024.4199999999998s)]
*  Axios, New York Times. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2028.74s)]
*  Sorry. Mr. President, given your concerns about corruption, you said that if there were any [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2029.86s)]
*  conflicts of interest with Elon Musk, you wouldn't let him anywhere near it. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2034.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2037.3s)]
*  Doge and SpaceX employees are now working directly at the Federal Aviation Administration and the [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2037.86s)]
*  Defense Department, agencies that have billions of dollars in contracts with Musk's companies or [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2041.46s)]
*  that directly regulate his companies. How is that not a conflict of interest? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2045.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm just hearing about it. And if there is, and he told me before I told him, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2047.86s)]
*  but obviously I will not let there be any conflict of interest. He's done an amazing job. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2050.58s)]
*  They've revealed, in fact, he's going to be on tonight, a big show called Sean Hannity at [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2054.18s)]
*  nine o'clock. And he's on and I'm on. And we talk about a lot of different things. And [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2057.14s)]
*  any conflicts, I told Elon, any conflicts, you can't have anything to do with that. So anything [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2060.98s)]
*  to do with possibly even space, we won't let Elon partake in that. Yeah, please. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2063.94s)]
*  On immigration, sir, you said you would be sending the worst of the worst to Guantanamo Bay. What [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2069.86s)]
*  we're finding out is that there are a lot of low-risk migrants who don't have a criminal [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2073.38s)]
*  background who are also being sent. Are you thinking about this differently now? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2076.42s)]
*  No, they're going to be brought back to their countries. And with some persuasion, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2079.14s)]
*  every one of those countries, everyone in the as you know, every country is taking the people back. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2083.06s)]
*  So some of them are going to be brought back to many of them. Any of them that are low risk, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2086.58s)]
*  as you say, are going to be brought back to their countries. Yeah, go ahead, please. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2090.2599999999998s)]
*  Can you give us a bit of an update on where you stand with Venezuela? Yeah, it's real. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2094.5s)]
*  There are there's a basically a monthly license that can soon. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2098.5s)]
*  Well, you know, we had Venezuela on the run and it looked like that was going to be very good. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2100.9s)]
*  And when Biden came in, as he always does, he screws it up. And they started buying millions [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2104.8199999999997s)]
*  and millions and millions of dollars of oil, billions of dollars, actually of oil. And it [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2108.66s)]
*  gave them a new life, a new really lease on life. And but we'll see. We had some pretty good [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2112.8999999999996s)]
*  discussions with a lot of people within our government in the United States government [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2119.7799999999997s)]
*  that are involved in that. And Venezuela's no, you don't understand. Biden has been the shadow [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2122.5s)]
*  president in perpetuity taking the beautiful, as I call it, liquid. Oh, we have more than anybody. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2126.18s)]
*  They started paying a fortune to Venezuela and we're looking at that. Actually, why did they do [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2130.42s)]
*  that? Why were they doing that? Why would they go to the enemy and give them billions and billions [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2133.62s)]
*  of dollars? Now, with that being said, as you know, Venezuela has said very strongly they will not [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2137.3s)]
*  take any any illegal immigrant, any of the people that they sent over to us. They sent their gangs, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2140.82s)]
*  probably the worst gang anywhere in the world, as bad as MS-13, maybe worse. And they came out of [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2145.54s)]
*  the jails of Venezuela. They emptied their jails into our country and they said, we'll never take [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2149.3s)]
*  them back. Well, they took them back and they're taking them back and they are taking it back [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2152.6600000000003s)]
*  rapidly. They're sending a lot of people to Venezuela. They said they wouldn't take them back and [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2155.7000000000003s)]
*  they are taking back. But we're looking at Venezuela very seriously and we're going to be able to. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2158.6600000000003s)]
*  Don't forget, I've only been here for three weeks. Yeah. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2161.94s)]
*  Just a little clarity on, are you inclined to continue to allow Venezuela through, I think, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2165.22s)]
*  Chevron and other oil companies to export those petroleum products or are you- [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2170.74s)]
*  Maybe not. Yeah, maybe not. We're looking at that now. I just got here. When I was, when I left, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2173.54s)]
*  they weren't doing anything. They were ready to go. We give up. And then Biden came along and he [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2177.62s)]
*  gave them literally billions of dollars. I couldn't believe it, actually. And we have so much under our [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2181.3799999999997s)]
*  feet. Liquid gold. We have so much and it's pretty amazing. So we're looking at that whole situation, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2187.8599999999997s)]
*  why he did it. How about one more? Yeah, please. What can you tell us about the CIA drone flights [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2191.94s)]
*  over Mexico? Is this the next step in the war against the cartels? Well, we're going to see. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2196.18s)]
*  Should they have authority to take legal action? Mexico has allowed a tremendous number of people [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2198.9s)]
*  to go through their country into wars and even people coming from Mexico and illegals, totally [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2203.06s)]
*  illegal. They've allowed people to empty jails into Mexico and then let them come through with [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2207.06s)]
*  this totally ridiculous open border policy of the Biden administration. So millions of people have [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2210.66s)]
*  come in and hundreds of thousands and actually millions are criminals. They came in from jails [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2214.58s)]
*  all over the world. They release them into Mexico and they come into our country. They also came [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2218.5s)]
*  in from Canada, by the way, large numbers through Canada. In fact, when we closed up the one border, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2221.06s)]
*  they came in through the other border. So Canada was, is not an uninterested party. But I will say [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2226.02s)]
*  this, we're dealing with Mexico. I have a very good relationship with Mexico, but I think Mexico [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2230.98s)]
*  is largely run by the cartels. And that's a sad thing to say. And if they wanted help with that, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2235.06s)]
*  we'd give them help. But Mexico, if you look at what's gone on with Mexico for years now, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2238.66s)]
*  but now especially it's run by the cartels and they've allowed millions of people to come into [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2241.7s)]
*  our country from jails and prisons of other countries from all over the world, not just [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2246.34s)]
*  South America, Africa, Asia, all over a lot from the Congo in Africa, a lot. They opened their jails. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2248.82s)]
*  They came in through Mexico and we have some of the worst criminals coming in from the Congo and [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2254.42s)]
*  other places. So it's not just South America and it's not just Venezuela, but they opened their [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2258.1000000000004s)]
*  jails. And you know, the crime rates in Venezuela and other places all over the world has gone way [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2261.7000000000003s)]
*  down. You know why? Because they've given us their prisoners, they've given us their drug lords and [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2264.5800000000004s)]
*  their gang members. And it's hard to believe that we accepted this. It's hard to believe that we [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2268.5800000000004s)]
*  allowed open borders and we're taking in hundreds of thousands and millions of people coming in [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2272.7400000000002s)]
*  from all over the world. They're absolute stone cold. It's pretty crazy that all of these violent [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2276.9s)]
*  criminals from all around the world are coming to America. And yet instead of doing crimes, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2281.38s)]
*  they're actually unironically through their presence and their proclivity to do less crime [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2286.82s)]
*  as opposed to the existing natural born us population, lowering the crime rate in the [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2292.42s)]
*  United States of America across the board. It's crazy. I guess like when they come to America, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2299.38s)]
*  they just no longer want to do crimes magically. You know, they're like, Oh yeah, well, we got [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2305.7s)]
*  jobs here. So no reason to do crimes. I guess that's what it is. America truly the nation [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2311.2999999999997s)]
*  of rehabilitation. Wonderful stuff. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05EjVEZ7fk&t=2316.58s)]
