# The Lies And Irresponsibility Of The U.S. Government | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y)
*  I think they're just straight up lying. That's it. Like a child, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  like a child that learned the wrong lessons, maybe a child who [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=5.68s)]
*  lied, and then got benefits from it and realized, oh, there's no [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=9.08s)]
*  repercussions for this, I'm just going to keep doing it over and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=12.68s)]
*  over again. And that's where we're at right now. Let's take a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=15.24s)]
*  look at what Jesse water said in terms of, you know, the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=18.16s)]
*  practical uses of lying. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=21.56s)]
*  How likely is the government to code social security for mental [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=24.2s)]
*  health disabilities? Everything is nothing is off the table. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=31.48s)]
*  Okay. Do not worry. M hud sent me this. It's Monday. Doge is the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=35.32s)]
*  laziest, most overpaid bunch of incompetent, unelected [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=40.56s)]
*  bureaucrats we've ever seen. I'm starting to think Doge employees [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=43.84s)]
*  don't work 120 hour weeks. They received 7 million to have chat [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=46.68s)]
*  GP build them a website embedding a single Twitter feed [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  and nothing else. Is this guy just like a Doge hater? But he [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=52.36s)]
*  hates on Doge from the, from the perspective of efficiency, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=56.56s)]
*  because I love that. I think it's very funny to shit on Doge by [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=59.96s)]
*  being like, I wish they were doing what they claim they were [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=65.0s)]
*  doing. I want to destroy the federal government. These guys [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=68.44s)]
*  are not doing it well enough. Yes. And he knows his shit. So I [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=71.5s)]
*  of course also did a little bit of reading into the Doge stuff, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=76.64s)]
*  not necessarily the broader scopes, but the broader scope of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=79.88s)]
*  the Doge stuff or the incompetence. But of course, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=84.52s)]
*  whenever Elon Musk or any Republican administrator comes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=88.28s)]
*  out and says some insane shit, you have to unfortunately go and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=92.2s)]
*  do a little bit of reading to figure out what's actually going [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=97.88s)]
*  on. It is truly frustrating on a totally different note. It is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  insanely frustrating that when a government employee now says [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=108.72s)]
*  anything, I immediately I'm like, that's definitely wrong. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=114.68s)]
*  It's annoying. Okay. No, don't say wow, now it's good to do [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=118.76s)]
*  your own research. Like, yes, it should not be that way. Okay, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=123.2s)]
*  yes. When a federal government employee says something, it [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=127.44s)]
*  should be at least kind of true. Okay, maybe I'm crazy. Call [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=133.12s)]
*  me woke, but or call me a liberal, maybe. Okay. But with [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  like the exception of I don't know, the State Department or [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=143.44s)]
*  whatever. Okay. Even with the State Department, there is the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=146.74s)]
*  expectation for me is, you know, just say things that are at [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=151.8s)]
*  least kind of true. Okay. Really, seriously. Like they [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=156.8s)]
*  don't even like at least back in the day, they have some skin in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=163.34s)]
*  the game. They wanted to do some sort of some semblance of like [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=166.68s)]
*  institutional preservation. So they basically would at least [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=170.24s)]
*  like massage the truth. Right now they just straight up will [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=175.56s)]
*  just be like, Yeah, there are 100 and there are 700 million [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=180.28s)]
*  people on Social Security. And every single one of them is 180 [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=185.6s)]
*  years old. And it's like, okay, well, that's not true. But [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=190.22s)]
*  that's literally just not like there is. I know that that's not [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=193.88s)]
*  true. And it's not 180. It's 150. And the number is actually [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=197.72s)]
*  400 million, according to Elon Musk, but I'm just giving you an [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=200.54s)]
*  exaggerated example. And it's very frustrating. It's very [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=203.0s)]
*  frustrating that like every day. They come out, maybe this is a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=207.56s)]
*  super dumb thing to get annoyed by. Maybe I'm silly. Okay. But it [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=213.44s)]
*  makes me so mad that virtually everything that this government [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=218.76s)]
*  says is not only just a lie, but it's also the stupidest kind of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=223.28s)]
*  lie. And also, every single person that is a supporter of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  this administration, this regime immediately believes it and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=235.28s)]
*  starts repeating it over and over and over again, obviously [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=238.8s)]
*  intentional. I don't think it's that intentional. I don't think [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=242.84s)]
*  Ezra Klein, you know, they're doing a media blitz to like, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=245.88s)]
*  keep you paying attention to like silly things to make you [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=249.72s)]
*  feel tired and scared. I don't think that's correct. I don't [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  think that it's a strategy. I think they're just stupid. I [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=257.06s)]
*  think we're giving them too much credit. No, they realized lying [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=260.8s)]
*  is awesome. And it works because there is no apparatus to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=266.12s)]
*  successfully combat this kind of stuff because nobody trusts [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=271.24s)]
*  mainstream media anymore. So they just lie. That's it. You [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=274.92s)]
*  don't have to be super brilliant to lie, especially in the way [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=278.56s)]
*  that they lie. Because the way that they lie is not even like in [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=282.04s)]
*  any way, shape or form, giving credit to the previous liars of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=287.04s)]
*  previous administrations, whether they were the government [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=292.68s)]
*  stooges of the past, such as like the George H. W. Bush's of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=297.48s)]
*  the world, or whether it be people that at least cared about [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=301.68s)]
*  like the idea that the American government is, is a functioning [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=306.66s)]
*  body, and that they will massage the truth, but they won't [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=312.04s)]
*  actually just straight up come out and be like, Yeah, actually, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=315.88s)]
*  Social Security was giving every trans person $1 million. We [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=319.02000000000004s)]
*  should kill the trans people now because Social Security was [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=324.74s)]
*  giving them $1 million. Who's gonna check me? No one. You know [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=327.54s)]
*  what I mean? That's literally there. That is the modus operandi. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=331.06s)]
*  That is how they're operating. Every f**king day, they'll come [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=334.1s)]
*  out and be like, Yeah, we found out that Social Security was [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  giving a billion dollars to anyone who is of Guatemalan [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=340.42s)]
*  descent, actually, as long as they're undocumented. And then [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=344.6s)]
*  everybody believes it. It's like, how? What are you saying [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  right now? That is the most insane thing I've ever heard. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=351.22s)]
*  But I said, once again, I repeat this, it is not like some [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  brilliant thing. Okay, I don't think this is a brilliant [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=359.02s)]
*  strategy to like flood the market. I don't think that they [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=362.65999999999997s)]
*  have like a coherent, well established worldview. I don't [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  even think that they're in allegiance with one another. I [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=371.38s)]
*  would say that broadly, there's like three different, three [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=375.29999999999995s)]
*  different camps within the the administrative state at this [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=378.74s)]
*  moment. Okay, you have the Republican institutional [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=382.5s)]
*  defenders like the Mitch McConnell's of the world. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=386.58s)]
*  They're a dying breed, but they still very much are represented [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=388.58s)]
*  in like even the Federalist Society judges and justices and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=392.26s)]
*  whatnot. Some of them do care about like institutional [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=395.14s)]
*  preservation. You have the billionaire kleptocrats that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=398.62s)]
*  don't care about anything, but they just want to do the Curtis [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=402.34s)]
*  Yarvin gutting of all institutions and and create like [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=404.58s)]
*  this weird techno monarchy. Okay. And then you have the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=408.78s)]
*  MAGA guys who are just loyal to Trump and that's it. Okay. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=412.38s)]
*  Broadly defined, I feel like there's three camps. There's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=417.34s)]
*  three different camps in the Republican Party. None of them [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=420.78s)]
*  agree with one another. None of them want the same things. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  They're all just basically held together by resentment towards [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=426.06s)]
*  libtards. Okay, pretty much resentment towards libtards and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=429.38s)]
*  the the Republic institution defenders that are Republican, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=435.14s)]
*  like the old school Republicans obviously care about [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=439.54s)]
*  deregulation and tax cuts for the wealthy and stuff. So [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=441.46s)]
*  they're fine with the kleptocrats running the show. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=444.09999999999997s)]
*  And the MAGA guys are too to recognize that this actually [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=446.73999999999995s)]
*  harms them. This doesn't help them at all. So that's basically [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=449.73999999999995s)]
*  it. That's like how they've been able to create this delicate [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=453.14s)]
*  allegiance. But I don't think that they have like long term [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  plans that are I don't think they have long term plans that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=461.5s)]
*  are directly aligned with one another. Okay, but at the end of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=464.74s)]
*  the day, they're not putting forth like a brilliant strategy [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=468.46s)]
*  that requires a lot of forethought and is is is [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=473.06s)]
*  deliberately destroying confidence in the media or [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=477.94s)]
*  whatever. Right? I think they're just straight up lying. That's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=480.94s)]
*  it. Like a child, like a child that learned the wrong lessons, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  maybe a child who lied, and then got benefits from it and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=490.21999999999997s)]
*  realized, oh, there's no repercussions for this. I'm just [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=493.7s)]
*  going to keep doing it over and over again. And that's where [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=496.22s)]
*  we're at right now. Let's take a look at what Jesse water said in [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=498.66s)]
*  terms of, you know, the practical uses of lying. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=502.06s)]
*  It's not really the same. They know we are waging a 21st [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=506.82000000000005s)]

*  kind of doesn't it kind of does not exist. Okay. And I'll tell [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=713.54s)]
*  you why. It's because I think liberalism requires you to not [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=718.98s)]
*  really maintain any sort of hardline approach. Okay. Beyond, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=727.18s)]
*  I guess, like some social progressive perspectives, but [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=733.86s)]
*  like you almost entirely agree with the republicans on economic [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=737.38s)]
*  policy, because the the center, the fundamentals within liberals [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=740.86s)]

*  not bringing about the material change that people want to see. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=780.1s)]
*  Okay. Center left doesn't it is just easier to say you're [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=784.62s)]

*  politics too much. Yeah, anyway, but let's get back to the right [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=792.46s)]
*  wing. Okay, actively projecting and claiming that all the notes [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=796.14s)]
*  are coming down the top. And that's why we have to do full [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=799.82s)]
*  scale information war disappears. What you're seeing on the right [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=802.74s)]

*  seem to be talking about collective insanity. Yes, I am [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s79EOkevS0Y&t=895.74s)]
