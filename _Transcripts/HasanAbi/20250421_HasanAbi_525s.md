*  ridiculous. All right. Funny how America created the capitalism [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=7.04s)]
*  and spread it around the world. And as soon as it was soon as a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=9.88s)]
*  big enough competitor themselves comes along, they whinge and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  moan about it and lash out. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=15.24s)]
*  Also, this President Trump is warning countries against [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=22.0s)]
*  cheating to get around his tariffs. But China may be taking [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  steps between the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  bro. What do you mean? Like America is telling other [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=28.88s)]
*  countries not to work with China. And then China is saying, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=33.4s)]
*  Hey, don't do that. Oh my god, you guys my two year old is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=38.44s)]
*  going to be so jealous. Oh my god. Miss Rachel follow. That's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=41.52s)]
*  crazy. That's crazy. This is the greatest follow of all time, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=45.96s)]
*  dude. What's the expectation from China to just like, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=50.08s)]
*  quietly sit by and get f**king and allow America to destroy [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=53.6s)]
*  global trade? How dare they? How f**king dare they dude? How [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=58.96s)]
*  dare they? That is not allowed. You see, I can't believe you [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=65.32s)]
*  would want to not allow America to global trade in its entirety [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=70.52s)]
*  for no real reason. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=75.88s)]
*  The US and other nations. What is going on? Grady tremble of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=77.6s)]
*  Fox Business live at the White House. Hey, Grady. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=80.72s)]
*  Hey, good morning, Dana. China says that if the US makes any [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=84.12s)]
*  deals at the expense of China, then it's going to quote, take [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=87.36s)]
*  countermeasures in a reciprocal manner. And some experts are [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=91.36s)]
*  warning that Beijing could try to strike deals with European [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=95.24s)]
*  countries, for example, that are too good for those countries to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=98.76s)]
*  refuse at the expense of the United States. But President [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=102.24s)]
*  Trump doesn't seem deterred from his plan posting on Truth [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=106.52s)]
*  Social about the country's trying to reach agreements with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=109.84s)]
*  his administration saying, it's good to see that the world knows [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=112.88s)]
*  we are serious because we are. They must right the wrongs of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=116.52s)]
*  decades of abuse, but it won't be easy for them. But for those [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=119.8s)]
*  who want the easiest path, come to America and build in America. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=123.52s)]
*  I got a readout from James and Greer yesterday, and it looks [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=128.68s)]
*  like we're north of 15 now of legitimate serious offers on the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  table. The thing I can say you could look for is that when we [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=136.48s)]
*  think of deals really, really close, then my expectation is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=138.96s)]
*  the president's going to want to meet with that world leader here [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=141.64s)]
*  in the White House in order to close the deal. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=144.32s)]
*  So we will be paying very close attention to which world leaders [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  are coming to the White House in the not too distant future. And [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=150.08s)]
*  here's what the Trump administration is trying to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=152.96s)]
*  address or at least cut into a $300 billion trade deficit with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  China. Administration officials say despite that number, the US [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=159.72s)]
*  actually has the upper hand. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  China imports 11 and a half million barrels of oil a day. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  I hate to see my goat Doug Burgum in this shitty position [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=171.28s)]
*  having to defend the Trump administration's incompetence, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=177.04s)]
*  you know. This man sold software to Microsoft and became a [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  billionaire. And look at him now, this beautiful man with his [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=184.2s)]
*  beautiful eyebrows. He has to sit around and defend the dumbest [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=188.88s)]
*  most incompetent baboon in America. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=193.8s)]
*  They import about 25% of the calories they consume every [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  burger maniacs rise up, Doug Burzum. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=200.84s)]
*  Every day. And so when we think about the US and us as being a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=204.04s)]
*  superpower, we're an energy superpower, we're a food [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  superpower. And China is highly dependent. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=210.04s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, who has been one of the leads in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=212.6s)]
*  negotiating these new trade deals. He's meeting with his [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=216.12s)]
*  South Korean counterpart this week, I believe here at the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=219.36s)]
*  White House. So the wheeling and dealing continues despite these [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  new warnings from China. Dana. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8NmkjlBw6A&t=225.6s)]
