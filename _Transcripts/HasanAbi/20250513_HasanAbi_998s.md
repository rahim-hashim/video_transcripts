# This Is The Real Reason Trump Ignored Netanyahu | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM)
*  Well, there they have. And what did Israel do? They're pummeling Gaza again in an effort to deliberately ruin any kind of ceasefire negotiations that may take place between us and the United States of America. They are basically cutting out the middlemen and going directly to the United States of America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. I know you've called this move a flood is so funny that the Democrats are like, remember when I was like, Democrats don't have Democrats don't have any discernible policies that you can point to. Okay. They're like a rudderless ship. Remember when I said that? And then Democrats were like, bet we do have a policy. It's it's called defending the United States of America. And then they're like, we're going to have to do this. And then they're like, we're going to have to do this. And then they're like, we're going to have to do this. And then they're like, we're going to have to do this. And then they're like, we're going to have to do this. And then they're like, we're going to have to do this. And then they're like, we're going to have to do this. And then they're like, we're going to have to do this. And then they're like, we're going to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=17.28s)]
*  Como important to remember as a moral crowd because Islam is the one guy that's educated [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=47.28s)]
*  and educated inside Islam, doesn't build and rules or valueshh Hodja is that colorhead [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=51.84s)]
*  that you say, there are also political leaders and political rules in Islam and see what [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=58.02s)]
*  happens in Islam. So he has to learn to pre-sett Africa's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=61.52s)]
*  strength from Islam. And he has to say, well don't [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=67.48s)]
*  get too used to spreading sliced chips and." [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=70.78s)]
*  This is another issue, so that founded by was it they hangar [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=72.84s)]
*  What do you think is really behind this move? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=76.2s)]
*  It is influence peddling at its most outrageous and egregious. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=78.48s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump's $400 million presidential palace [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=82.12s)]
*  in the sky represents the largest gift that's ever been [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=86.12s)]
*  conferred on any president by any foreign government [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  in the history of the United States. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=93.48s)]
*  And it's outrageous and unacceptable. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  And just as troubling as the gift itself [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=97.12s)]
*  is the source of the gift, Qatar, as you noted, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=100.28s)]
*  Qatar is a state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  It has a long and ugly history of financing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=105.72s)]
*  a barbaric terrorist organization, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=108.24s)]
*  which has on its hands the blood of Americans. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=110.48s)]
*  And it's a cruel irony that both Air Force One [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=114.12s)]
*  and Qatar are going to have something. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=117.12s)]
*  Dude, it's crazy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=119.28s)]
*  It's the most egregious form of bribery [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=120.84s)]
*  in that it's not being done on behalf of Israel. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=122.68s)]
*  No, exactly. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=124.8s)]
*  No, they're like, how dare, how dare? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=126.56s)]
*  First of all, what the f**k do you think [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=128.88s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has been doing? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=131.56s)]
*  The reason why they don't chirp about Saudi Arabia doing this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=133.88s)]
*  or the UAE doing this or Israel doing this, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  countries are all literally just unconditionally [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  and permanently pro-Israel [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=143.24s)]
*  and don't give a f**k about Palestinians. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=144.64s)]
*  Whereas Qatar at the very least is neutral. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=146.64s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  Their crime is neutrality. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=150.76s)]
*  Dog, people in your district are starving. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=153.04s)]
*  Yeah, this is the Richie Torres, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=156.04s)]
*  the Richie Torres meme. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Come here, dude. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=161.32s)]
*  Okay, to be fair, the last American who shat all over Saudi Arabia [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=163.16s)]
*  made his end by way of a bone saw. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=165.84s)]
*  That's also true. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=168.08s)]
*  Saudi Arabia doesn't give a f**k about Palestinians. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=170.36s)]
*  Saudi Arabians do. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=173.4s)]
*  The royal fam, maybe some in the royal family do. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  Have you ever heard MBS talk about Palestinians? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=178.56s)]
*  He sees them as a nuisance. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=180.88s)]
*  He just wants a direct flight from Tel Aviv to Riyadh. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=182.28s)]
*  And the Palestinian population is in the way [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=185.68s)]
*  of accomplishing that goal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=188.24s)]
*  That's it. That's it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=190.12s)]
*  All of this chirping about Qatar, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=191.48s)]
*  despite the fact that it is transparent, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=193.76s)]
*  transparent bribery, okay? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=196.92s)]
*  All this chirping about Qatar, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  two things should be true at the same time, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=200.88s)]
*  is because Qatar is neutral on Palestine, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  as opposed to being directly antagonistic. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, contact to the former leader of the Arab Americas [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=211.88s)]
*  for Trump to start the talks that got Alexander released. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=213.92s)]
*  Curious to see what the Republicans who think [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  random-cause students were in contact [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  with will say about this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=219.0s)]
*  The back channel talks that led to the release [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=221.08s)]
*  of Eden Alexander began with a message [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=222.52s)]
*  from a US official to Bashar Ababa, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=223.84s)]
*  former leader of the Arab Americas for Trump, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=225.84s)]
*  two Israeli officials, one Palestinian official, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=227.4s)]
*  and one US official, Tel Axios. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=228.8s)]
*  The reason why they're frustrated [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=230.56s)]
*  is not even because of the very obvious bribe, okay? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=232.4s)]
*  The reason why they're frustrated is because [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=237.84s)]
*  Qatar is now playing a formative role [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  in cutting out Israel from the story, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  because Israel itself doesn't wanna play a role [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  in the negotiation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=245.88000000000002s)]
*  The whole story's worth reading. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=246.96s)]
*  Israel found out through Mossad. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  Breaking, Israel target heads of military wing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=250.56s)]
*  Mohammed Sinwar in an airstrike on a bunker [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=252.24s)]
*  underneath the hospital in Gaza. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=254.12s)]
*  The resource told me results of the strike are still unclear. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=255.08s)]
*  The timing of this is just before Trump, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=257.88s)]
*  Wicuff, and the Israeli negotiators they made Netanyahu send [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=259.12s)]
*  will be in Doha, seems aimed at making sure [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=262.56s)]
*  no progress is made during this window [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=264.72s)]
*  on further exchange and ceasefire deals. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=266.08s)]
*  Yeah, bunker underneath the hospital again. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=268.0s)]
*  Israel does wanna play a role. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=270.16s)]
*  They just want that role to be sabotaging [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=271.44s)]
*  any progress whatsoever. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=272.8s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=273.72s)]
*  That's why they're pummeling Gaza extra hard. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Israel found out about the secret talks [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=281.12s)]
*  about Alexander and IDF soldier, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=282.76s)]
*  not from the White House, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=284.12s)]
*  but from its own intelligence services, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=285.12s)]
*  Israeli officials say. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  Israel normalization takes back seat [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  as Trump announces Saudi deals. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=289.4s)]
*  The approach pro-Trump activists for secret talks [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=291.12s)]
*  that freed Eden Alexander. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=293.12s)]
*  Also seeking a way to convince President Trump [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  to put more pressure on Israel, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=296.0s)]
*  and Trump's team was intent on freeing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  the last living American held in Gaza. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=298.35999999999996s)]
*  Baba, a Palestinian American businessman [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=299.76s)]
*  who helped Trump make inroads with Arab voters in 2024 [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=301.88s)]
*  became the unlikely intermediary. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  Special outside of Gaza reached out to Baba in late April [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  in hopes of striking up a dialogue [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=308.72s)]
*  with Trump envoy, Steve Witkoff. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=309.88s)]
*  It took time for that back channel to materialize, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=311.96s)]
*  but it gained momentum last week [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=313.76s)]
*  as senior Israeli official tells Axios. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=314.8s)]
*  Around 20 messages were passed between the sides [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=316.96s)]
*  in calls and texts to Baba over the past two weeks. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=319.08s)]
*  He also spoke to chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=321.44s)]
*  According to a source familiar, Baba declined the comment. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=324.04s)]
*  Witkoff, with help from Qatari officials in Baba, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=327.64s)]
*  ultimately convinced the militant group [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=330.4s)]
*  that releasing Alexander for free [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=332.52s)]
*  would carry a lot of weight with Trump. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=333.92s)]
*  Around 10 p.m. Doha time on Sunday, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=335.92s)]
*  the Israeli Prime Minister, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=337.68s)]
*  Netanyahu, formally agreed to release Alexander. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=338.64s)]
*  Then Witkoff called Alexander's parents [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=340.8s)]
*  to tell them the news that they waited [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=343.32s)]
*  483 days to hear. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel found out about the secret talks about Alexander, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=347.0s)]
*  an IDF soldier, not from the White House, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=348.96s)]

*  When Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's right-hand man, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=355.36s)]
*  Ron Dermer, was in Washington last Thursday, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=357.56s)]
*  his American counterparts didn't mention the back channel. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=359.24s)]
*  Dermer had to raise it himself with Witkoff, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  an Israeli official said. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  Witkoff confirmed to Dermer [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  that later Israel wouldn't have to give anything [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=367.36s)]
*  in return for Alexander's release, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=368.48s)]

*  How insane that Mossad is spying on Americans. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=371.12s)]
*  And Ron Dermer is operating on that intelligence [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=377.24s)]
*  that he gets from his own intelligence agencies [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=380.24s)]
*  and brings it back to Steve Witkoff. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=383.52s)]
*  Wow, I am shocked. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=385.92s)]
*  Alexander's release was previously at the center [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=388.24s)]
*  of the unprecedented direct negotiations [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=389.92s)]
*  between Trump's hostage envoy, Adam Baylor, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=391.28s)]
*  and leaders in Qatar in March. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=393.08s)]
*  The Israeli government has also learned about those talks [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=394.8s)]
*  from its intelligence services who were spying on. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=396.4s)]
*  At the time, Trump was seeking a deal, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=398.56s)]
*  by the way, I don't believe that they were spying on Moss. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  I believe they were spying on the American side. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=402.0s)]
*  At the time, Trump was seeking a deal [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=404.08s)]
*  to free Alexander from his State of the Union address [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  and was demanding the release of 250 prisoners [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=407.08s)]
*  held in Israel in exchange. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  Those talks hit a dead end three hours before Trump's speech. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=410.35999999999996s)]
*  To this day, Trump's advisors believe Netanyahu's aides [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=412.67999999999995s)]
*  leaked to the press in order to sabotage it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=414.64s)]
*  Witkoff loaded a similar proposal three weeks later [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=416.84s)]
*  under which he would release Alexander, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=419.64s)]
*  and Trump would publicly call for a temporary ceasefire [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=420.88s)]
*  and talks for a comprehensive deal. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=422.76s)]
*  The US refused. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  Over the next several weeks, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=426.08s)]
*  Israel gradually expanded its ground encourages [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=427.08s)]
*  in the Gaza, increased air strikes, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=428.72s)]
*  and continued to block the entry of all humanitarian aid. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=430.0s)]
*  On April 22nd, Qatari Prime Minister, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=433.52s)]
*  Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=435.04s)]
*  visited the White House and met with Witkoff and Trump. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=437.24s)]
*  He raised a proposal supported by a comprehensive deal [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=439.52s)]
*  to release all hostages and end the war. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=441.52s)]
*  But the US message was that a shorter term partial deal [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=443.88s)]
*  was the only game in town. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=446.36s)]
*  When he returned to Doha, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  al-Thani told and encouraged them to make a gesture to Trump [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=449.32s)]
*  that could shift his position, the official said. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=451.6s)]
*  The US officials reached out to Babah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=454.0s)]
*  Remember when everyone would say, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=455.24s)]
*  well, why doesn't like release hostages as a good gesture? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=456.44s)]
*  Well, there they have, and what did Israel do? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=462.12s)]
*  They're pummeling Gaza again in an effort to deliberately [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  ruin any kind of ceasefire negotiations [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=468.88s)]
*  that may take place between us [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=471.2s)]
*  and the United States of America. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=472.68s)]
*  They are basically cutting out the middlemen [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=474.8s)]
*  and going directly to the United States of America [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=476.91999999999996s)]
*  because they recognize that Israel is the unreasonable party [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=480.32s)]
*  and they're trying to show the United States of America [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=482.96s)]
*  that they are the ones who need to force Israel [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=485.88s)]

*  that America does not give a shit. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=497.12s)]
*  And I don't believe that America gives a shit. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=499.15999999999997s)]

*  I think it was like 13. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=670.4s)]
*  Anyway, in terms of motivating reasons [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=671.76s)]
*  for Donald Trump to potentially, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=675.12s)]
*  in terms of motivating reasons for Trump [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=678.68s)]
*  to potentially push for a ceasefire [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=681.12s)]
*  and directly go, directly deal with Hamas [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=683.72s)]
*  instead of Israel is one, he desperately needs a W. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=687.52s)]
*  He came with this mandate that he was gonna end all wars [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=691.32s)]
*  and all this shit and he hasn't done so. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=695.76s)]
*  And it seems like conflict is only escalating, okay? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=698.0s)]
*  Number two, sheer Israeli arrogance, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=701.08s)]
*  the entitlement and the arrogance [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=704.44s)]
*  of the likes of Benjamin Netanyahu is very annoying [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  for a narcissist like Donald Trump. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=710.48s)]
*  Okay, that's another reason. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=713.28s)]
*  Number three, $400 million jet from Qatar, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=715.76s)]
*  a country that is at the very least neutral [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=720.56s)]
*  to the Palestinian cause, okay? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=722.4s)]
*  And there was a fourth thing that I was gonna say, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  but I can't remember now. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=728.24s)]
*  But yeah, those three are the only reasons [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=729.76s)]
*  why he would dial this back. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=733.9599999999999s)]
*  And I guess four is because he reads the room [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=736.56s)]
*  to a certain degree, but starving to death, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=738.76s)]
*  dying of thirst, skeletons, no, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=742.0s)]
*  there is no fucking care or consideration [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=743.52s)]
*  for the wellbeing of Palestinians in this equation. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=750.28s)]
*  Don't be fucking ridiculous. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  Don't be ridiculous. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=757.3199999999999s)]
*  At most, the only thing that he gives a fuck about, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=759.1999999999999s)]
*  the only thing that he gives a fuck about [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=764.4s)]
*  is how bad it looks. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  And yeah, he is, oh, that's right, that was the other one. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=767.76s)]
*  Trump is feeling powerless from Ukraine, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=770.0s)]
*  so he wants to throw his weight around, exactly. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=771.48s)]
*  He can't control Russia, he can't pro-Islam, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=773.76s)]
*  but owns a dog, is that what you just asked me? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=776.36s)]
*  Dude, I drink alcohol too, the fuck? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=779.48s)]
*  What does pro-Islam mean? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=782.44s)]
*  Do Israel supporters think that stripping the plan from him [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=784.12s)]
*  will make Trump like Israel more, talk about delusional? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=786.44s)]
*  No, they're just, they're hitting that [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=789.5600000000001s)]
*  because it's an angle to attack Trump, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=791.72s)]
*  and it's a good way to get, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=795.16s)]
*  it's a good way to get the Democrats on board too. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=798.24s)]
*  Yet I'm here today not merely to condemn [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=800.5999999999999s)]
*  the past chaos of Iran's leaders, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=802.16s)]
*  but to offer them a new path and a much better path [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  towards a far better and more hopeful future. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=805.16s)]
*  As I've shown repeatedly, I'm willing to end past conflicts [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=807.2399999999999s)]
*  and forge new partnerships for a better, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=809.2399999999999s)]
*  for a better and more stable world, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=811.7199999999999s)]
*  even if our differences may be very profound, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=813.1199999999999s)]
*  which obviously they are in the case of Iran. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=815.1999999999999s)]
*  I've never believed in having permanent enemies. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=817.3599999999999s)]
*  I am different than a lot of people think. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=819.16s)]
*  I don't like permanent enemies, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=820.5999999999999s)]
*  but sometimes you need enemies to do the job, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=821.64s)]
*  and you have to do it right. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=823.7199999999999s)]
*  Enemies get you motivated. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=825.0s)]
*  In fact, some of the closest friends [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=826.4399999999999s)]
*  of the United States of America are nations [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=827.92s)]
*  we fought wars against in generations past, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=829.6s)]
*  and now there are friends and our allies. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=831.32s)]
*  I want to make a deal with Iran. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=833.0s)]
*  If I can make a deal with Iran, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=834.44s)]
*  I'll be very happy if we're going to make your region [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=835.52s)]
*  and the world a safer place. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=837.48s)]
*  But if Iran's leadership rejects this olive branch [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=839.76s)]
*  and continues to attack their neighbors, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=841.88s)]
*  then we will have no choice, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=843.12s)]
*  but they inflict massive maximum pressure [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=844.16s)]
*  driving Iran in oil exports to zero like I did before. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=845.6s)]
*  If you know that they were a virtually bankrupt country [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=848.16s)]
*  because of what I did, they had no money for terror. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=851.32s)]
*  They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=853.2s)]
*  and take all action required to stop the regime forever [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=854.9200000000001s)]
*  having a nuclear weapon. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=857.2s)]
*  Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=858.4399999999999s)]
*  So are Democrats going to shit on Trump [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=861.24s)]
*  for sidestepping Israel? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=862.56s)]
*  No, they can't. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=864.68s)]
*  They can't directly yell at Trump for doing that. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=866.9599999999999s)]
*  Even, I mean, there are some Democrats who have done that, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=870.0s)]
*  but they're fucking insane. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=872.68s)]
*  But most Democrats are not, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=874.24s)]
*  most Democrats are not going to directly say that, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=875.72s)]
*  which is why they'll just like angle the, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=877.76s)]
*  they'll angle their conversation around fucking, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  they will angle their conversation around like Qatar, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=885.2s)]
*  or they'll defend John Fetterman, you know, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=889.16s)]
*  the most valuable ally. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=892.88s)]
*  Anyway, also here, Mobile McDonald's in Riyadh, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=894.4s)]
*  girl to boycott is what I say to Saudi Arabia. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=899.4s)]
*  Owning a dog is Haram and Islam guys. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=902.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't give a fuck, dude. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=904.4s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=905.6800000000001s)]
*  Hello? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=907.24s)]
*  I don't fucking care, dude. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=908.76s)]
*  I eat bacon too. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=910.24s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  When the fuck have I, what do I, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=912.76s)]
*  do you think I pray five times a day? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=914.64s)]
*  Do you think I sneak out? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=916.48s)]
*  Also, this was an insane title. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=917.92s)]
*  Okay. Miss Rachel doubles down support for children in Gaza. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=919.96s)]
*  Doubles down support for children in Gaza. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  It's sad that people are trying to make it controversial [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=926.64s)]
*  when you speak out for children [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=927.92s)]
*  that are facing immeasurable suffering. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=928.88s)]
*  The YouTube educator said in a recent interview with Zatale, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=930.12s)]
*  that's a crazy thing to just write as an article title. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  Genuinely. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=940.04s)]
*  Yeah. All my piss breaks are actually me facing Mecca. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=941.12s)]
*  Yeah. Miss Rachel was Mehdi Hassan. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=945.68s)]
*  You clearly, I also, by the way, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=947.8s)]
*  I have to end early today at seven hours, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=951.48s)]
*  unfortunately chatters, but there's a good reason for it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=954.96s)]
*  I'm going to be on CNN with Caitlin Collins in a little bit. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=957.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=960.08s)]
*  So there's a good reason for it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=960.92s)]
*  And there's a bunch of other interviews lined up as well [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLQSxQqVsM&t=963.88s)]
