# JD Vance Reveals True Motives After Speech In Greenland | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs)
*  My god, oh my god [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=0.0s)]
*  I said exactly the method that they were gonna utilize and the messaging that they were gonna utilize [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=1.28s)]
*  Literally what three months ago when they first said this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=6.54s)]
*  Remember when they first talked about annexing Greenland, I told you like this is exactly point by point what they're gonna say and do [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=11.02s)]
*  Anyway, yeah JD Dunst is taking questions in in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=23.88s)]
*  Greenland right now and we'll cover that right now. We'll go to JD Jedidi advance right now as I blast off [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=27.62s)]
*  you can let the people know but [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=34.42s)]
*  Here we are [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=37.14s)]
*  Specific threats coming from China and Russia things that you did not know about before are we talking battleships? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=39.14s)]
*  Icebreakers any type of military equipment or is it economic? Well, I don't want to get too specific [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=45.82s)]
*  But yes, we know that the Chinese are very very interested in this island [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=51.06s)]
*  We've seen some of the economic pressures that they've tried to place on Greenland [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=56.6s)]
*  We know that they're increasingly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=60.48s)]
*  engaging in military training and military interest [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  Certainly they started to describe themselves as a near Arctic power and I part of that is justifying taking a further in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=67.56s)]
*  Where's the suit bitch? Why aren't you wearing a suit? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=75.16s)]
*  Disrespectful showing your tits like that. Who the hell do you think you are? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=78.4s)]
*  He thinks he's zell Disney, bro [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=82.6s)]
*  People it has it its geographic placement makes it very important for the national security of the United States [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=86.4s)]
*  But for world security what we have to recognize is that if the Chinese and the Russians are going to pursue their national interest [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  We need a president who's going to pursue the American national interest and that means ensuring that Greenland is safe [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  When can we expect an update on the internal investigation into that signal chat week has that investigation concluded? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=108.04s)]
*  I think we'll get an update soon. Look we take it very seriously [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=116.44000000000001s)]
*  we all accept that a journalist should not have been excited and invited into the chat and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=119.84s)]
*  Members of the administration including my dear friend Mike have taken responsibility for it [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=124.84s)]
*  Find the American media's obsession with this issue [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=129.32s)]
*  very very interesting because I have to remember about four years ago when American military leadership made a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=132.52s)]
*  Catastrophic error that got 13 American innocent Americans killed in Afghanistan and had about 80 billion dollars of military [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=140.76s)]
*  Equipment turned over to one of the worst terrorist organizations in the world and for years the American media our best soldiers [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  Chad it killed our best soldiers no one [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  No better soldiers than the ones that they killed that was meaningful and substantive about what happened [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=159.44s)]
*  And now the same American media that covered for the Biden administration after the untimely death and the unnecessary death of 13 brave [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=165.28s)]
*  Americans is really really interested in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=173.52s)]
*  467 brave American warriors in Afghanistan were killed under the Trump administration only 13 under the Brandon [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=177.28s)]
*  I'm gonna go ahead and say maybe pulling out was the right idea, you know [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  You've got another thing coming [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=190.12s)]
*  President Trump has said on Monday on Tuesday on Wednesday on Thursday [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=191.88s)]
*  And I'm the vice president saying it here on Friday. We are standing behind our entire national security team [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=196.18s)]
*  Yeah, good the tariffs [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  There's been some retaliation some signals at least in the media that Canada is going to respond to the president's tariffs [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=207.32s)]
*  What's your message for Americans that are going to see cost increase on auto manufacturing? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=214.32s)]
*  New cars that kind of thing is it by America or what's the message going forward there? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=220.12s)]
*  Well, let me say a couple of things [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=225.96s)]
*  First of all for the Canadians and we have many dear friends in Canada [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=227.96s)]
*  And of course, we love the Canadian people but the Canadian leadership [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=232.16s)]
*  Threatening retaliatory tariffs against the United States as president Trump often says they just don't have the cards [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=235.72s)]
*  There is no way that Canada can win a trade war with the United States [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=241.84s)]
*  What President Trump has said is he wants to level the playing field for decades? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=246.28s)]
*  Canadian leadership has forced American farmers and American manufacturers to play by an unfair set of rules [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  All President Trump has said is that we're done playing by an unfair set of rules [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=257.76s)]
*  If you're gonna do something to our area, then we're gonna do something back to your industries [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=261.84s)]
*  That's how you protect American manufacturing and that's how you protect American jobs [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=266.48s)]
*  Now what I'd say to the American people is is look the president ran on this and he said very clearly [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=270.56s)]
*  That we're done being the piggy bank of the entire world for 40 years in the same way that our European friends [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  I think have neglected [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  International security for 40 years a lot of our friends all over the world have used America as a piggy bank [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=285.96s)]
*  They have used us to absorb all of their excess economic production. What does that mean for Americans for Americans? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  Manufacturing jobs declining that's meant middle-class wages going down [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=299.7s)]
*  That's been whole towns that have been hollowed out by empty factories and that means in America that is less safe because our [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=303.34s)]
*  Manufacturing isn't as powerful now, you know, it was ironic [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=310.98s)]
*  He's not wrong about this point [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=314.74s)]
*  I hate that it's these guys that are making this point because he's literally not wrong [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=316.74s)]
*  About I mean he's angling it with like xenophobic [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=323.46s)]
*  xenophobic [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=326.62s)]
*  hyper-nationalistic [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=327.82s)]
*  isolationist attitudes [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=328.9s)]
*  But he's not wrong about manufacturing being shipped overseas and what that did to the middle class [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=330.5s)]
*  It's just that this administration is directly antagonistic to labor as well [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=337.82s)]
*  it's not like they're anti-business and pro labor and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=344.1s)]
*  It's and they're framing this not on the virtue of like bringing jobs back to the United States of America [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=347.86s)]
*  So that we can have a robust labor movement here so we can have American workers [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=354.38s)]
*  Succeed financially with one job like it used to be in the greatest days in the glory days in the post-world war two boom [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=360.26s)]
*  in America, but instead it's just like [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  We need to punish these allies [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=370.06s)]
*  we need to punish them for the deals that we signed with them at the behest of our capital owners and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=371.7s)]
*  We're still going to do a downward pressure on labor regardless of what we are doing with manufacturing [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=377.58s)]
*  As H. Bizzle is chirping about in the chat [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  This admin is doing obvious [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=386.94s)]
*  Directly antagonistic things against labor unions, which is expected. I mean this is gonna be a very anti labor [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=390.38s)]
*  Administration H. Bizzle screaming in the chat going he's a boomer [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=398.38s)]
*  That's the reason why he uses all caps [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=401.94s)]
*  We've been discussing the largest attack on organized labor in US history occurring last night with Trump stealing bargaining rights from over 1 million federal workers [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=403.58s)]
*  This is yet another great example of like what the Trump administration is doing. Yes, I acknowledge your chat [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=410.41999999999996s)]
*  We will talk about that as well [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=415.9s)]
*  He just robbed like a million plus federal workers and their right to engage in work stoppages [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=417.21999999999997s)]
*  expanding on like key sectors and and and their ability to do collective bargaining [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=423.78s)]
*  He's talking about taking over Greenland, but your rhetoric today is more about encouraging the Greenlandic people to vote for independence [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=430.05999999999995s)]
*  Do you think the rhetoric has changed about that or what's your message? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=437.3s)]
*  No, I don't think it's changed at all. Look at the president said clearly [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=441.06s)]
*  He doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  But he absolutely believes that Greenland is an important part of the security not just of the United States [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=446.94s)]
*  But of the world of course the people of Greenland, too. It's very simple [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=452.7s)]
*  I think the president's been very consistent here from his State of the Union from his inaugural address and every public statement that he's made this [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=456.7s)]
*  Territory Greenland really matters for the security of the United States [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=465.66s)]
*  It's extremely vulnerable right now [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=469.42s)]
*  And if the people of Greenland were willing to partner with the United States [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=471.82000000000005s)]
*  And I think that they ultimately will partner with the United States we could make them much more secure [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=475.5s)]
*  We can do a lot more protection [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=481.06s)]
*  And I think they fare a lot better economically as well this has to happen and the reason it has to happen [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=482.82000000000005s)]
*  I hate to say it is because our friends in Denmark have not done their job in keeping this area safe [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=488.82s)]
*  They just haven't done it. It's very simple for all of our friends in the American media [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=494.82s)]
*  Where you at now libtards go ahead tell me how go ahead [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=504.18s)]
*  Tell me how this is different, you know, I [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=509.58s)]
*  Mean I like this because personally [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=513.34s)]
*  They just say it out loud and they do it in such a stupid way [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=516.5799999999999s)]
*  But like this isn't all that different from the exact same rhetoric [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=520.9799999999999s)]
*  You would hear from the Biden administration either like obviously they wouldn't talk about like annexing Greenland [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=526.18s)]
*  You know they they move the needle in the rightward direction even further, but you know, the messaging is is [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=532.0999999999999s)]
*  Identical. It's like all they we got safety concerns. We're gonna defend them [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=539.2199999999999s)]
*  They clearly can't defend themselves [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=542.9s)]
*  Safe from what we are the number one violent country. What do you mean safety? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=546.26s)]
*  My god, oh my god [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=556.3s)]
*  I said exactly the method that they were gonna utilize and the messaging that they were gonna utilize [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=557.8599999999999s)]
*  Literally what three months ago when they first said this [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=563.14s)]
*  Remember when they first talked about annexing Greenland, I told you like this is exactly point-by-point [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=567.5799999999999s)]
*  What they're gonna say and do we are gonna liberate Greenland from the colonizers? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=573.82s)]
*  Interests how the u.s. Could develop Greenland more economically. Could you speak a little bit more about that? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=582.22s)]
*  I know secretary Wright is here. Have you guys spoken about energy? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=587.5s)]
*  Senator Lee is here as well. Just wondering what those discussions [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=591.7800000000001s)]
*  I'm like my point actually is that other countries have explicitly gone after Greenland and I think with a mind towards economic [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=594.46s)]
*  exploitation [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=602.66s)]
*  Sometimes asking Greenland to get itself into terrible economic debt traps that would make the people of Greenland not [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYn1hsP7aNs&t=603.62s)]
