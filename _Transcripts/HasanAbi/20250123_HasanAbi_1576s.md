*  up, everybody? Can't say that about a legend. Yeah, I mean, what time is it in the states [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=76.42s)]
*  right now? Six forty six. Why is Caroline not there? You mean in Hassan's room right [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=89.42s)]
*  now? She's getting ready. You freaks. Someone said, Why is Caroline not there? And I said [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=99.42s)]
*  in Hassan's room at this very second, she's getting ready. Hi, Jase. All right. Let's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=105.42s)]
*  talk about it, ladies and gentlemen. Since last we saw. Yes, baby. No money. And I did [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=112.42s)]
*  become the face of JVic Nation. Yes, we did break the Internet with our cosplay. Yes, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=118.42s)]
*  we did take some of the best images you'll ever see. I mean, I'm not totally convinced [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=125.42s)]
*  that, you know, Hassan isn't in Japan just to try and win me back. Like it's you know, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=132.42s)]
*  we were always looking for a will they won't they on our podcast and cutie and Hassan filled [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=138.42s)]
*  miserably at it. But now total failures, total failures. Now we actually have one in the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=143.42s)]
*  will they won't they is me and baby no money famous recording artist. And you know, now [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=150.42s)]
*  that I am also a gay icon and in a will they won't they I texted Hassan and Austin and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=156.42s)]
*  I basically said, Pack your I don't need either of you get out of my life. Don't look back. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=162.42s)]
*  You neglected me and now I don't need you anymore. So it's pretty warm in the sun. But [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=170.42s)]
*  my idea is that if it is cold, you'll probably get me a Montclair puffer that I can't get [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=178.42s)]
*  back. And I think that's what Christopher Walken would want. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=186.42s)]
*  No, I in all seriousness, totally character drop when when Alex baby no money asked me to do [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=192.42s)]
*  that cosplay, I was like, I really didn't know much about how far the JVIC fandom had gone. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=200.42s)]
*  But he was essentially saying, OK, I did. That's why I wanted to do it. That's why I want to do [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=206.42s)]
*  it. He's a bitter old mess. Robbed underpants. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=216.42s)]
*  Come on, show them what they're doing. I've robbed no one. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=223.42s)]
*  We saw room for you as a war. Yeah, you're on the edge. All right. Is the hockey puck? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=229.42s)]
*  No, it's the. So so I knew that there was a fandom, but I didn't know how adamant they were. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=236.42s)]
*  But Alex was like, we have to do this right. Stella Chu and Jessica Negri are going to help. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=246.42s)]
*  And they honestly put that cosplay together so fast. They put that cosplay together in under a week. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=252.42s)]
*  They're they're queens, they're gods. They had so much help. Shouts out to everybody who helped them with that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=259.41999999999996s)]
*  But they did such an awesome job and we had so much fun with it. I told I told Stella, like, honestly, I had a little bit of hesitancy to do cosplay like that, because I'll be honest, I sometimes don't feel like I have the leading man attractive energy to do cosplay. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=264.42s)]
*  I always feel like cosplayers are so attractive. And so I was a little nervous, but it was so much fun. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=287.42s)]
*  And, you know, Alex already wants to do more cosplay and everybody's been so receptive to it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=292.42s)]
*  So kind of a really cool experience. We had a great time. So much fun. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=298.42s)]
*  You know, just frolicking and getting to do a little boy love. That was awesome. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=304.42s)]
*  But yeah, we are in Japan, ladies and gentlemen, and I feel fantastic. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=312.42s)]
*  Went out drinking last night, got to meet and hang out with one of my my goats. I don't know if you guys have ever listened to the god. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=319.42s)]
*  Tanisha Sawa, aka Mondo Grosso, aka Rhymeso. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=329.42s)]
*  But I'm going to play a little bit of his stuff in the background. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=335.42s)]
*  But it was like one of those cool moments where I was in his recording studio and I literally got to be like, dude, I labyrinth is a life changing song for me. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=340.42s)]
*  Thank you so much. And he was like, oh, yeah, that's a pretty good song. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=352.42s)]
*  I guess he was so humble about it. If you've never seen this song, this is one of his tracks. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=357.42s)]
*  OK, he did promise me a signed album, which I didn't get last night. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=366.42s)]
*  So when we hang out with him tonight, I'm going to be like, so you remember that time when you said you give me a. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=372.42s)]
*  Give me a signed Mondo Grosso album. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=381.42s)]
*  Hello. Hi. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=389.42s)]
*  I am in Hassan's room. You have to get other from Arsh. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=393.42s)]
*  I couldn't get you because I can't get to. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=399.42s)]
*  Yeah, I need my back to his room. I need both. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=407.42s)]
*  All right. I don't know, just text. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=412.42s)]
*  Anyway, kind of a cool moment. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=421.42s)]
*  We I have had fantastic, fantastic, fantastic food since I've been here, which we kind of were a little lacking on last time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=424.42s)]
*  Is that in the hot walled city? Yeah, that video is filmed in the walled city is Austin there. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=434.42s)]
*  We have not seen or heard from Austin yet. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=439.42s)]
*  He might be acclimating to life on Tokyo Grinder. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=443.42s)]
*  I mean, Tokyo City. So we'll wait till he reaches out to us and and we'll see what he wants to do. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=449.42s)]
*  I think he just kind of wants to acclimate and get comfortable. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=459.42s)]
*  We'll see. I was hanging out with the one, the only Wake Wilder last night. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=462.42s)]
*  We also have Finn here. Finn's feeling under the weather, so he might not join us. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=469.42s)]
*  And then we also hung out with a creator in Japan. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=476.42s)]
*  He's the interviewer. I think his name is Caleb, who does all the interviews in Japan outside like the combini's. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=484.42s)]
*  Cole. That's it. Yeah. And he was awesome. He was so cool. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=491.42s)]
*  We got to the hot guy. Yeah, the hot guy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=496.42s)]
*  He was really fun. And we got to go have drinks with him and get some food. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=500.42s)]
*  And it was it was awesome. And so I have been working tirelessly on something. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=505.42s)]
*  We're trying to do a collab stream with he and his co-host where we go and on Sunday possibly dance with an interview, the Tokyo Rockabillies, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  because that's something he wanted to do, too. So we've we've reached out to them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=531.4200000000001s)]
*  So we're trying to put together a stream where we all dress like rock abilities and go dance in the park with them, which would be who cares? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=536.42s)]
*  I don't know. I think a lot of people do. It'd be a lot of fun. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=547.42s)]
*  Honestly, if none of you even watch, it'd be fun for me. I'm going to I'm going to get my dance on in the park. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=551.42s)]
*  But yeah, what else can I give you guys an update on? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=558.42s)]
*  I want a very lewd figurine in a crane game last night, which I'm pretty proud of. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=563.42s)]
*  Are you going to the baseball game? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=568.42s)]
*  I don't think baseball season is happening right now. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=573.42s)]
*  I do know that the Dodgers home opener is in Japan soon. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=576.42s)]
*  We might try and go to a sumo match because I think there's three more days in that tournaments. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=583.42s)]
*  Or in that tournament. I know we're doing training with them. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=591.42s)]
*  We're doing flower arrangement. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=595.42s)]
*  I think we're getting fitted for latex one day and then going to a latex party that we are allowed to stream. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=597.42s)]
*  But there is a high chance that we might get banned at that event. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=604.42s)]
*  So we're going to be quick on the trigger at that one. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=609.42s)]
*  I think what else? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=613.42s)]
*  I think what else? I think the art of no, where it's like the drum storytelling like, oh, we have that planned. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=615.42s)]
*  What else do we have? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=626.42s)]

*  What? Yeah, we've already set it up. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=644.42s)]
*  One piece gym muscle girl bar redemption stream. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=648.42s)]
*  There's a bunch of stuff on there. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=653.42s)]
*  You don't sound excited for that job. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=655.42s)]
*  You Japanese Communist Party. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=657.42s)]
*  Listen, I'm excited just on my depth. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=659.42s)]
*  Oh, they don't want a lot of people. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=663.42s)]
*  Darn fudge. Now I'm going to I'm going to miss out. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=668.42s)]
*  I'm just going to be thinking about the whole time. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=672.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Japanese pro wrestling we're going to try and do. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=677.42s)]

*  But this time he's not super uncomfortable. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=705.42s)]
*  What have you eaten so far? OK, so I found this. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=708.42s)]
*  That's true. He does have to address his home. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=713.42s)]
*  That's that is true. He definitely let us down. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=718.42s)]
*  I found like a ramen place that's more of like a udon kind of fusion. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeI5DI0J7g&t=723.42s)]
