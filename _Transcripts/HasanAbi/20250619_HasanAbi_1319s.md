*  Iran has a right to self-determination and defense. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=0.0s)]
*  And they should be making a immediately like what I never [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=5.0s)]
*  I never in my life thought that I would see the day like even [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=11.3s)]
*  with the anti-Israel sentiment overflowing and spilling over. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=17.1s)]
*  That's one thing but then to also take the offensive [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=21.2s)]
*  position the anti-western and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=26.5s)]
*  Oh buddy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=34.9s)]
*  And our chief international correspondent Lisa Doucette [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=37.2s)]
*  joins me again in the studio. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=39.3s)]
*  At least we were speaking a little earlier weren't we about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=41.4s)]
*  the hopes the possibilities of a diplomatic solution. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=43.5s)]
*  Let's just pick up with that and talk about that a little bit. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  Well everything everyone is on tender hooks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=49.6s)]
*  Certainly there's a lot of telephone calls going on between [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=52.7s)]
*  many capitals that includes capital in the region of the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=55.4s)]
*  Gulf States like the Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates Qatar [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=58.6s)]
*  very much want to avoid an escalation in the region and all [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=62.6s)]
*  that war in Iran is so close to them geographically right [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=65.7s)]
*  across the the waterway Western capitals are also really concerned. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=68.9s)]
*  They've all called for a de-escalation even as they say [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=73.3s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=76.6s)]

*  It's like it's like a death sentence dude. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=82.9s)]
*  It's like a death sentence when someone says Israel has a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=86.4s)]
*  right to defend itself. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=90.9s)]
*  They just mean like Israel gets to kill everybody in the region [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=92.5s)]
*  however, they want you know what I mean? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=95.30000000000001s)]
*  You think Iran will start targeting US military bases in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=97.2s)]
*  Baghdad or Qatar maybe not Qatar but Baghdad probably depends [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=99.9s)]

*  There are debates inside your rights. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=185.9s)]
*  Now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=187.4s)]
*  We don't know exactly because the messages that we are receiving [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  from Americans back door messages are that we were not [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=191.0s)]
*  involved either. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=194.3s)]
*  You're not involved and you're not going to be involved. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=195.1s)]
*  But the messages that are on public we are receiving through [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=197.8s)]
*  President Trump's tweets and you know his interviews though [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=201.5s)]

*  very much indicating America's word on the global stage is [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=207.6s)]
*  lower than dirt. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=210.8s)]
*  Is it they just whenever they say something just assume that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=212.8s)]
*  they mean the fucking opposite. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=215.9s)]
*  Okay, and and set up a self-defense measure because it's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=217.3s)]
*  going to be imminent that Americans have been aware they [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=223.7s)]

*  Okay. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=620.1s)]
*  It feels like a real dramatic vibe shift long-term consequences [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=621.9s)]
*  of the past 20 months Israel's overplayed their hand committing [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=627.7s)]
*  atrocities dragging us into wars and policing free speech in [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=629.9s)]
*  America all funded by taxpayers. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=632.7s)]
*  This all predates 20 months. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=634.0s)]
*  But by the way current poll leadership may not have the courage [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=636.0s)]
*  but we will negative views of Israel has risen in the US. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=639.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this is only an America is still one of the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=643.4s)]
*  only one of the most pro-Israel countries on the planet. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=646.1s)]
*  I think this switch up isn't simply because Israel's done [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=649.5s)]
*  like tremendous bloodshed or whatever. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=654.5s)]
*  I think a big part of the switch up also comes from the fact [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=656.3s)]
*  that people are just frustrated with our politics man. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=658.9s)]
*  I think the average person really recognizes that that no [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=663.4s)]

*  I think the the post Trump destruction of normal American [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=670.5s)]
*  politics is going to be severe far more severe than we think [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=676.9s)]
*  because there are I suspect a lot of people who voted for [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=680.9s)]
*  Trump because he was supposed to be a different type of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=684.3s)]
*  leader and represent even a mallet that will ruin the systems [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=687.0s)]

*  dynamic between politicians openly genuflecting and behaving [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=695.9s)]

*  placing Israel's interest over the interest of American citizens [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=704.8s)]
*  that is inevitably going to cause anger and resentment even [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=708.5999999999999s)]
*  amongst some of the most loyal right-wing bases because like [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=712.0999999999999s)]
*  I didn't really think that the Trump administration like posturing [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=717.0s)]
*  is anti-war was going to create severe fissures severe repercussions [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=721.5s)]
*  and divide the base at all because I think most people just [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=728.6999999999999s)]
*  like think that they're anti-war but they're not actually anti-war [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=731.3s)]
*  when push comes to shove but at this point but at this point [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=736.0s)]
*  it does feel as though there are at least some people who would [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=740.5s)]
*  probably be more on board with war if they were getting something [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqxLb7U1l4&t=745.0s)]
