# This Scene In White Lotus 3 Broke Me | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE)
*  put that in there just to say like, I'm smart. I'm not like a regular kind of person. I'm, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm very smart in the way that I'm, I'm delivering this like, yeah, it's not the daily wire basketball [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=5.36s)]
*  movie. It's a, it's one step above it. It's like a more liberal framework. In any case, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=11.72s)]
*  that wasn't even the main point of contention here. I think that, yeah. I mean, it just [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=18.68s)]
*  gave me so much anxiety. That's it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Since this is the part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news. That's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  precisely what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you what I watched last night. I watched [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  white lotus. I finished it. I watched white lotus. I finished it. And let me tell you [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=37.52s)]
*  folks, folks, I've yet to watch one piece. I haven't decided if I want to bank it or [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=40.84s)]
*  if I want to do it on a weekly basis chat. Let me tell you something. Okay. Let me tell [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=46.96s)]
*  you. Season three of white lotus is too anxiety inducing. I'm not going to give you any spoilers [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=52.08s)]
*  or nothing. Okay. I'm just simply going to say it quite literally, it quite literally [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=57.8s)]
*  gave me too much anxiety. So I think the acting was fantastic. I think the acting was amazing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=64.92s)]
*  It was maybe too amazing. People say it's not as good as season two. Some people say [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=71.32s)]
*  it's the best season, but it's still underwhelming. I think it was fine. I mean, Walter Goggins [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=74.88s)]
*  is my, is my icon. I mean, he's amazing. He's amazing. The auto-gynophilia trans monologue [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=79.8s)]
*  made me feel like Mike White was a little bit of a reactionary for incorporating it, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=89.88s)]
*  not necessarily against that sort of thing. I mean, who knows? Did I say what Walton Walton [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=94.36s)]
*  goat King Goatkin he admitted to some transphobic views in a podcast. Oh, he went on Andrew [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=101.06s)]
*  Sullivan's podcast. Nice. I don't care. Like I don't care as in like a transphobic sentiment [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=107.28s)]
*  being showcased in a, in a work is not something that I'm against because transphobia and even [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=112.32s)]
*  like auto-gynophilia could be something that you could, you could show. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  It's just a matter of how you show it, right? It's not necessarily something that's like [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=124.24s)]
*  untouchable. You can't show it. Like it's more so what you do with it. But the way that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=129.48s)]
*  he, the way that he showed it was not necessarily the way that he showed it. Wasn't like a confused [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  person, but more so the way that he showed that was basically being a trans person is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=142.92s)]
*  just like having a fetish about your, your, your, your penis. Like that's the way that's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  the way he delivered it as in, okay, this is so high level trans topics that we're immediately [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  diving into. It's going to be very confusing. It's going to be very confusing for most [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=164.73999999999998s)]
*  chatters. They don't even understand what, what we're talking about. Like it's I understand [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=168.98s)]
*  that this is incorrect and also wrong. I'm saying it's fine to put incorrect and wrong [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=174.14s)]
*  things in works of art. You will never have me go. That's reactionary. That's bad. Like [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=180.7s)]
*  reactionary opinions exist in the real world. You know what I mean? Like it's, it's good. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=186.22s)]
*  I would go so far as to say it's a good thing to showcase reactionary opinions and in works [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=191.06s)]
*  of art as well. It's just how you broach the subject matter that I think is important. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=195.74s)]
*  And he kind of, he just kind of covered it as like someone who is the director's vision [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  in that one felt like he was just kind of putting that in there because it's like, Ooh, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=211.58s)]
*  it's like a weird, scary thing. It's like a transphobic person's perspective on trans [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  people from the outside, but not in the same way as like, law, these are just like men [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=223.78s)]
*  wearing dresses, but instead it's one step further. It's like a more intellectual transphobic [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  perspective where it's like, I know something, I know something that other people don't know. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=235.86s)]
*  And then they put that in there just to say like, I'm smart. I'm not like a regular kind [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=240.16s)]
*  of person. I'm, I'm very smart in the way that I'm, I'm delivering this. Like, yeah, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  it's not the daily wire basketball movie. It's a, it's one step above it. It's like [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=250.7s)]
*  a more liberal framework. In any case, that wasn't even the main point of contention here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=254.74s)]
*  I think that, yeah, I mean, it just gave me so much anxiety. That's it. He is still very [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=261.78s)]
*  good at writing the most characters. Like he really is. I mean, it makes sense. He probably [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=269.58s)]
*  like he's probably himself. Like you can't, it's so like the Duke guy, I forget his name, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=275.85999999999996s)]
*  famous actor Zhukov from death of Stalin, right? Whatever his name is. He's also the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=285.94s)]
*  up as apparently, but he was Jason Isaacs. Yeah. Jason Isaacs was so good. And his situation [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=293.42s)]
*  reminded me of how like whenever I'm getting, I don't know, quote unquote canceled and how [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  I just like shove that deep, deep down and don't try to make that a problem for my friends [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  and my family. And I just like try to shelter them from that kind of thing. But the anxiety [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=320.38s)]
*  doubled down for me personally, watching him go through the motions. Obviously it's not [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  a one-to-one comparison because when I'm going to cancel, it's like, cause I'm woke. He was [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=330.86s)]
*  actually doing crimes, right? But like the very act of hiding the very act of hiding [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=333.86s)]
*  your shame and hiding that instability from your, from your immediate family was, it was [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=341.36s)]
*  so relatable. It pissed me off. Like it made me extra anxious. And obviously I didn't, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=347.7s)]
*  you know, do the things that he did both before that caused the anxiety or rather do the things [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=354.58s)]
*  that he did after not going to give you any spoilers, but interesting, interesting stuff. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=360.26s)]
*  I mean, it was decent. I'll probably watch season four. It's just cause I'll forget. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=366.58s)]
*  I'll forget how much anxiety I had watching season three. So when season four comes around, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=371.58s)]
*  I'll probably watch it. Yeah. I know Jason Isaac wears the yellow, stand with us ribbon, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=377.06s)]
*  the pro Israel ribbon, the, the bring back our hostages ribbon. Yes, I know he's still [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=383.5s)]
*  an amazing actor that doesn't, the fact that Mike white said that maybe Belinda just deserves [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=389.42s)]
*  an eyes ending without connecting how her story came from a circle is in a way nihilistic [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=393.58s)]
*  way shows he is a much a thinker. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. That's actually a really [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=397.52s)]
*  good point. That's the other point where there's like, listen, like Belinda's plot point, like [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=403.92s)]
*  it's supposed to be assholes getting a comeuppance, you know, no one is perfect. No one is good. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=411.16s)]
*  Every single person gets like, brought down a couple of pegs. Maybe one person makes out [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=418.8s)]
*  better than they started, but like her character arc quite literally was supposed to invoke [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=424.04s)]
*  some kind of punishment in my mind, like her becoming her, her, the financial motivation, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=431.32s)]
*  like turning her into a bad person that in and of itself was supposed to be something [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=438.67999999999995s)]
*  that you point to and go see, she's a bad person as well, but maybe her arc is not over [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=444.32s)]
*  because I had two goats on the show. Okay. Let me tell you, let me tell you who my goats [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=450.11999999999995s)]
*  were. And you might know this. You might've already guessed it, but my goats were porn [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=456.4s)]
*  shy who, by the way, underrated, fantastic guy. Okay. My goats were porn shy. And, and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  of course, what's his face. I'm the other, the other Thai dude with, with Lisa guy talk, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=471.84s)]
*  Yeah. Guy talk is my number one goat. Okay. Guy talk is goat talk. And the entire time [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=480.76s)]
*  I was watching, I would like, I would yell at Lisa. I was like, get away from him. You [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=487.2s)]
*  know? Cause I knew, I knew she was trouble. I knew her ass was no good for my man guy [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=491.84s)]
*  talk, who simply is a fool. Okay. He is a kind hearted fool and MOOC also known as Lisa [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=498.55999999999995s)]
*  played by Lisa, who is an incredible actress. By the way, I had no idea. I didn't realize [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=508.52000000000004s)]
*  you could be like, I thought Cape off stars was like robots. You know what I mean? Like [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  not real. I thought they were just like built in a fucking lab to just activate in front [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=517.84s)]
*  of cameras to dance and sing and shit. Like I cannot comprehend how good of an actress [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=523.52s)]
*  Oh my God. It was, it was crazy. Lisa cannot act. No, she was good as fuck. Yo, you're [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=532.24s)]
*  crazy. Am I crazy? I thought she was good as hell. Hey, you're so Western brain. What [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=539.84s)]
*  do you mean? You don't expect any musician to also be like that good as an actor. I thought [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=547.04s)]
*  she was great because the reason why I thought she was great is because I believed the, the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=553.52s)]
*  relationship. Like I believed her. I believed her as a person. I believed her ambitions. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=557.96s)]
*  I believed her motivations. I, she, she was very believable. That's what acting is. She [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=564.32s)]
*  seemed like a real person. And so did guy talk. And I loved their, I loved their relationship. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=572.48s)]
*  I loved their back and forth. I think they were great. Maybe you're just gullible anyway. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=580.2s)]
*  It's okay if you're crazy. It's cool that your wise foreign scholars enjoy Lisa. I really [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=583.32s)]
*  hated Zion's Disney channel, original movie ass acting. Oh yeah. He was, he was really, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=587.76s)]
*  yeah, he was not good, but to be fair to him, to be fair to him, he was literally on a superstar [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=593.36s)]
*  squad. It's like Bronnie James. You know what I mean? You're like, yeah, if you're going [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=603.2s)]
*  to get compared to LeBron, it's going to be difficult. Like you're, you're, you're already [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=607.92s)]
*  already had the fucking basics, but come on dude. He was, he straight up was surrounded [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=613.04s)]
*  by an insane cast at all times. Like he's being mashed up against some goats. It's it, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=618.76s)]
*  it made it extra bad. It made it extra bad. He nailed it. I have an NBA role though. No, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  I didn't like that. I didn't. It's not that I was annoyed by his character because there's [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=632.68s)]
*  plenty of characters I get annoyed by and Mike white. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=636.88s)]
*  He writes characters in the most annoying ways possible. His character was not annoying. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=639.6s)]
*  Like Patrick Schwarzenegger was incredible. He actually did a much better job than I expected [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=645.2s)]
*  him to do. He literally, he was so good. He was so convincing as he is built for that [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=651.48s)]
*  role. He is that guy, that guy that he was in the show. He is that guy straight up. Fantastic. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=659.36s)]
*  Yeah. Patrick held his own, even though he's an evidence and baby. Absolutely. Everyone [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQRP8TCH4vE&t=667.68s)]
