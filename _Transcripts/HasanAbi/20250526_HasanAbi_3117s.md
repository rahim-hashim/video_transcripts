# Jordan Peterson Got COOKED By Atheists | HasanAbi Reacts to Jubilee
**HasanAbi:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg)
*  Dude, this is unstoppable force meets immovable object. Jordan Peterson is a maximum yapper who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=0.0s)]
*  loves semantics. He is so incredibly annoying about never being pinned down, like deliberately [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=7.2s)]
*  refusing to be pinned down on any position whatsoever. So much so that he refused to even [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=14.72s)]
*  entertain the notion that he's a Christian. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=19.68s)]
*  Alright, this was an abysmal showing for Jordan Peterson. And the reason why I love this is because [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=21.76s)]
*  he has fallen so severely out of favor at this point. He has fallen so severely out of favor, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=33.52s)]
*  once hailed as the intellectual Titan of the right, getting absolutely [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=42.08s)]
*  cumstant and dumpstered on by a bunch of atheist twinks, hitting him with like the most basic [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=49.28s)]
*  Reddit atheism lines I've ever heard. The fact that he could not manage it because he's just such [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=57.04s)]
*  a weirdo who won't even reveal whether he was won't even reveal whether he was like a Christian [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=62.56s)]
*  or not is so amazing. It's so awesome that this is now like his intellectual depravity, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=70.08s)]
*  his his lack of interest in being even coming around is like intelligent is great. And yeah, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=78.0s)]
*  originally, this was one Christian versus 20 atheists, which they changed the title of the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=85.44s)]
*  video at the behest of Jordan Peterson. A Christian, you'll find out why immediately in the beginning. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=90.72s)]
*  You say that I haven't claimed that. Oh, what is this? Is this a Christian versus atheist? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=98.8s)]
*  Don't be a smartass. Either you're a Christian or you're not. Which one is it? You're really [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=103.28s)]
*  quite something you aren't tight, but you're really quite nothing, right? You're not a Christian. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=107.2s)]
*  I'm done with him. Hello, the YouTube videos title literally used to be one Christian versus 20 atheists. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=111.04s)]
*  Hello there. I'm Dr. Jordan Peterson. I'm a clinical psychologist, a professor emeritus [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=120.48s)]
*  at the University of Toronto, an author, a podcaster, public speaker. And today I'm surrounded by 25 [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  atheists. My first claim atheists reject God, but they don't understand what they're rejecting. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=132.88s)]
*  Good afternoon, Dr. Peterson. How you doing? So this claim here that atheists don't know [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=152.0s)]
*  what they're rejecting. My background is in studying to become a traditional Catholic priest, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=157.12s)]
*  daily mass, daily rosary, going on long retreats deep into the magisterium and biblical hermeneutics. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=161.92s)]
*  Like I was thoroughly in it. And it seems like I do know what I'm missing. Is there something that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  I missed over years of study, both this issue formally and living out religion so deeply? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, you obviously feel that you missed something when you were practicing for the priesthood. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=178.56s)]
*  Your aim was off then. So there's always the possibility that it's still off now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  What was off about my aim in the first place? I don't know. It might take a long time to figure out. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=188.24s)]
*  Then it seems kind of like this no true Scotsman type of fallacy in which you're the arbiter of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=192.56s)]
*  people's aims and how they understand those aims to be. How is it that you can claim that people [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=196.96s)]
*  don't know something that you know about their life despite not having- [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=201.68s)]
*  Bro, after demons, on the demonic debate lord scale, the number one demons online are vegan [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=205.52s)]
*  debaters and only followed closely by reddit atheists. Okay. There is no, I'm telling you right now, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=214.08s)]
*  these guys are basically the two, like the two groups out there online that you never want to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=223.68s)]
*  have an argument with. Okay. Because they will never shut the up. They will not shut up until [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=232.0s)]
*  you kill yourself. And then they'll sit on top of your dead body and say, you're not going to hell, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  at least because it's not real. That's what they'll say. Okay. They will overwhelm you [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=243.52s)]
*  with debate techniques you haven't seen. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=254.08s)]
*  Very dangerous, very, very dangerous group. Okay. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=261.68s)]
*  Reddit atheists, reddit atheist debate lords are such a dangerous group of individuals [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  that it makes me understand why the inquisition happened. It makes me understand why they would [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  just burn these on a cross. Like imagine you're, you know, imagine you're a priest and you [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  encounter one of these guys in the wild. Instantly you're going back and being like, we have to all [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=298.56s)]
*  of them. Okay. Not a single one of them can exist in the world because not even because like it's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=302.64s)]
*  a real threat to the church is standing, but instead just it's unsustainable. Okay. It's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=308.8s)]
*  unsustainable. In that them. Well, it's obviously a generic claim, just like the atheist claim that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=315.44s)]
*  there's no God is a generic claim. In your case, it would have to be specified more. And I'm not [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=323.12s)]
*  claiming to understand what was going on in your mind, but my experience. Because calling [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=328.08s)]
*  bullshit is hard. Yeah, dude, it's because they're profound. That's why not because they're incredibly [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=333.28s)]
*  annoying. With atheists is twofold is that they have a very reductive notion of what constitutes [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=339.68s)]
*  God, let's say in the Judeo Christian tradition, hurt by someone who was religious or by the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=347.2s)]
*  religious enterprise or perhaps by God himself, so to speak. And that's left them with an animus. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=353.28s)]
*  But I think that you have a reductive view of what atheism what the is going on with this camera, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=358.23999999999995s)]
*  bro. Oh God. Even the cameras like, please don't do this. Don't do this. Don't bring up. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=362.88s)]
*  Don't bring up Reddit atheism. If you, if you cover Reddit atheists, like we're cooked. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=371.2s)]
*  God, these cameras, man. So goddamn annoying. All right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=376.4s)]
*  Is you've defined religion so broadly to include any sort of having aim in life, any sort of cultural [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  archetypes or having a metaphorical substrate. And atheism to you is a very specific type of like [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=388.32s)]
*  three people in the world that are these Roskulnikov type of they're they want to get away with a [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=393.52s)]
*  perfect murder. It seems like you have the reductive view of what an atheist is. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=398.4s)]
*  Well, let's start with your blessing right now. Don't you dare chat. It's science. You. Okay. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=401.6s)]
*  Oh my Einstein. Don't say bless. How do you define the God that you're rejecting? Like what is God [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  to you? You studied in the church. You found that unsatisfactory. How would you characterize [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  what you rejected? I think the average Christian believer, when they say that they're Christian [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  and they believe they mean some sort of God that is all powerful, all perfect is somehow involved [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=427.36s)]
*  in the matters of this world and that we look to them through wisdom and with the logos incarnate [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=433.04s)]
*  in Christ. And it also seems like you don't believe in religion in the way that the average [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=437.68s)]
*  Christian says that they believe in religion. And there are as many gods out there as there are [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  believers because everybody has mutually exclusive and different views of what God is. So it seems [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  like everybody had mutually exclusive views of what God is. No one could speak to each other. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=451.6s)]
*  The mere fact of communication presumes a commonality of assumption and definition. And so, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=457.68s)]
*  and it's certainly not the case that I regard any archetypal manifestation whatsoever as [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=463.68s)]
*  equally religious. So that's not a real. Dude, does this guy ever answer something directly? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=469.44s)]
*  It's just like, oh my God, I'm so happy that this is finally, this is the last chapter. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  It started with, it started with Slavo Zizek. Okay. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=485.36s)]
*  It started with Slavo Zizek and now it's ending with a bunch of Reddit atheist twinks. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=493.36s)]
*  And I love that. Just like you. Yeah. Just like me. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh God. He'll claim. Let me give you an example, for example. There's a sub-narrative in the story [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=506.24s)]
*  of Moses where Moses is rewarded with a glimpse of God. Okay. And that's one of the ways that God [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=514.08s)]
*  is characterized in the Old Testament stories. Yes. Now Moses is a faithful servant of God and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=519.36s)]
*  a good man. At least that's the case within the confines of the story. One possible interpretation. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  It's the case within the confines of the story. Obviously. When we look at the Bible, the Bible [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=529.6s)]
*  can't precisely say anything because there are so many different exegetical and hermeneutic views of [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=540.32s)]
*  this particular book and that everybody has agreed, or everybody has disagreed historically on, it [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=545.2s)]
*  seems like even the most benign detail about a book this big. And it seems like you can only say [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=550.4s)]
*  that the Bible says something if you first presuppose that it's univocal. So your claim [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=555.68s)]
*  essentially is that Moses in the Old Testament plays the role of a villain or is irrelevant? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=560.4799999999999s)]
*  Because the alternative claim is that he's good. I'm saying that we can't know. Because we can't talk to those authors. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=565.12s)]
*  If you are going to start with the presupposition that there's nothing I can say about any of these [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=569.3599999999999s)]
*  stories that you're not going to disagree with from the perspective that there are multiple [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=574.2399999999999s)]
*  potential competing claims, then I can't speak with you. So we also have a short time here. So [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  I want to get to the core of what you're arguing here. And I'd love if we could [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=584.72s)]
*  The core of what I'm arguing. Dude, this is unstoppable force meets immovable object. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=587.76s)]
*  Jordan Peterson is a maximum yapper who loves semantics. He is so incredibly annoying about [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  never being pinned down, like deliberately refusing to be pinned down on any position whatsoever. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=600.4s)]
*  So much so that he refused to even entertain the notion that he's a Christian. Okay. In a YouTube [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=605.6s)]
*  video that was previously titled Christian versus 20 atheists. Okay. The answer was Jordan [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=611.52s)]
*  Peterson is supposed to defend Christianity as a Christian. Okay. And he got destroyed so hard [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=618.56s)]
*  by these yappers that he forced Jubilee to change the title of the video. It is crazy. There's a [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=626.96s)]
*  couple of really good moments in here, which is why I wanted to watch it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=634.0s)]
*  The atheists reject God, but they don't understand what they're rejecting. So I'm trying to give you [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=637.76s)]
*  an example of what's being rejected and its complexity. Okay. So God rewards Moses with a [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=643.2s)]
*  glimpse of the divine. So this is a definition of the God that atheists are hypothetically rejecting. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=650.16s)]
*  A possible one. I said, ah, I didn't say the. I said, ah, right. It is possible. Yes. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=655.6s)]
*  Is it? So despite the fact that Moses is a stellar character and he's had a long and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=664.16s)]
*  difficult life and can withstand a lot of difficulty and travail, God puts him between two cliffs. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=670.72s)]
*  So we can just see a crack of what's in front of him. And when God walks by, he allows him to see [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=681.76s)]
*  his back. Okay. So the implication and implication of that story is that the divine is fundamentally [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=686.96s)]
*  unknowable. It's a pinnacle experience and that people in their finitude have to be shielded from [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=695.12s)]
*  a comprehensive vision of the basis of reality. Well, that's not the God that's defined in that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  manner, right? Is a, is not, it's not a simple personification. It's not a simple old man in [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=709.2800000000001s)]
*  the sky. It's something that in its essence is unknowable and overwhelming. And that isn't, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=715.28s)]
*  in my experience, the God that's defined by atheists who are attempting to undermine the story. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=721.68s)]
*  I mean, it's the same claim, for example, that you're a finite creature and that you face something [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=726.88s)]
*  that in the final analysis is unknowable and that you have to establish a relationship with it, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=732.88s)]
*  regardless of your inability to perceive or even withstand perceiving the whole. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=738.9599999999999s)]
*  Okay. Is there a problem with that? I mean, the problem is that when we look at, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=743.76s)]
*  famously when you've been asked, do you believe in God, the question becomes, what do we mean by God? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=748.0799999999999s)]
*  And in the Bible, it's not even clear the biblical authors know what God is because [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=751.6s)]
*  Yahweh has historically emerged from an early storm God, a deity that doesn't exhaust the category [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=755.36s)]
*  of deity. And that has changed over the Old Testament. Does God have physicality? Does God [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  not have physicality? It seems like, yes, if you define a religion to mean anybody that has an aim, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=763.92s)]
*  anybody that looks at the unknown, anybody who wants to go from chaos to order is inherently [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=768.64s)]
*  religious, then yes. But also in the same way, I could define atheist as somebody who doesn't [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=773.36s)]
*  dogmatically believe in a religion or somebody who doesn't regularly attend religious services [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=777.68s)]
*  or belong to a denomination. Help, especially the audience, kind of like boil this down. There was [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=781.28s)]
*  a lot of words there that the central claim is that we exist somewhere between the finite and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=786.08s)]
*  the infinite. A central claim. A central claim is that we exist somewhere between the finite and [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=789.92s)]
*  infinite. No, I said that we were finite and we had to establish a relationship with the infinite. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=794.72s)]
*  Yeah, then in that case, then we're all religious. But then I can do the same thing and define one [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=800.72s)]
*  particular element of atheism. It seems like we both have a reductive view of what the other [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=805.2s)]
*  side looks like to the point where a conversation seems incoherent and not just incoherent, but not [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  in the way that the average Christian understands Christianity to be. Do you have a problem? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=814.96s)]
*  Pause there. Sorry, you've been voted out by the majority. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=818.96s)]
*  They are dorks. I know they are. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, David. Hello, N.O. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=824.48s)]
*  I don't know anything about the Polynesian deity, Lono. So you're rejecting something [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=831.36s)]
*  without knowledge of what you're rejecting. I'm not rejecting it. Do you more than I'm rejecting? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=836.64s)]
*  Do you believe in Lono? I don't know anything. Do you believe in Lono? Do you believe that he [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=841.2s)]
*  is a deity that exists in the world, exists in the universe, exists in the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=845.44s)]
*  existence of everything? Do you believe that Lono is a deity? I'll answer that question once you [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=850.32s)]
*  answer my question, which is do I reject everything that I'm ignorant of? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=854.8800000000001s)]
*  Because that's your presupposition that undergirds your argument, and unless you can prove that that's [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=862.32s)]
*  valid, then there's no point in... My question is quite simple. Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=866.48s)]
*  formulated accurately. Do you believe that Lono exists? Yes or no? I'm not going to answer that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=871.2s)]
*  question for the reasons I just described. You already insisted that if I reject something, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=878.72s)]
*  that if I'm ignorant of something, I reject it. Do you think that everyone in the world has to [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=884.4s)]
*  know everything simultaneously for that to be valid and true? I think in order for your argument [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=889.84s)]
*  to be true, in order for it to be true that we atheists don't understand what we're rejecting, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=895.12s)]
*  then you need to also apply that to yourself and to Christians and to Muslims and to any other [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=902.48s)]
*  person on this earth where if you don't understand... Oh my God. I just realized they both sound like [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=907.04s)]
*  different versions of Kermit. Like this guy sounds like new Kermit and this guy sounds like old [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=913.36s)]
*  Kermit. Wow. Just a random thing that I noticed. I know it's not the main point here. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=919.84s)]
*  You understand what you're rejecting the belief in, then you can't reject the belief in it. That's [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  the implication of your claim. I did say that I rejected the belief in Lona. Focus on the debate. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=931.2800000000001s)]
*  You're zoned out. I'm not. They're just fucking arguing because the initial point that Jordan [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=936.32s)]
*  Peterson presented here is atheists don't understand what they're rejecting. So this dude is making an [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=941.36s)]
*  argument to Jordan Peterson about the existence of a Polynesian deity. If you don't know [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=946.0s)]
*  what this Polynesian deity is, why do you reject it? And it's silly because... All right, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=954.96s)]
*  let's just skip this part. Coming here to the studio, I was physically moving. I was changing [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=961.12s)]
*  my position. If I said, I believe the Mona Lisa is very moving, and you said, you don't really [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=965.12s)]
*  understand what you're saying, it's nailed to the wall. I would say that you're the one who doesn't [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=972.16s)]
*  understand what I'm saying, not the other way around. And the way that relates to this... [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=976.56s)]
*  Oh my God, this is so... Oh, wow. It's like a hyper focus on semantics, on steroids. Okay. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=980.88s)]
*  Morality and purpose can't be found with science. Okay, this is a little bit more interesting as a [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=988.16s)]
*  premise, as a claim. Okay. I think this is a more interesting claim. Let's see. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=992.0799999999999s)]
*  Purpose cannot be found within science. I disagree. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=996.08s)]
*  What is up, Mr. Canada? How you doing, man? I'm doing great. What's your name? Brian. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  I think... Yeah, it's the Christopher Hitchens argument that Christians don't believe in Zeus, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1009.36s)]
*  so they're just atheists minus one God. It's interesting that you say that morality and [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1012.24s)]
*  purpose can't be found in science. Actually... Not within science? Within science, sure, sure, sure. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1016.64s)]
*  Purpose, I actually grant you, because purpose is subjective, right? Unless you want to boil it down [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1020.1600000000001s)]
*  to the purpose of life is just to procreate, right? Sure, whatever. Morality is actually [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1024.24s)]
*  something that we do see. We actually have examples of Neanderthals, an older individual [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1028.64s)]
*  was found in a tribe, missing an arm, missing teeth, still alive, somehow in his 40s, 50s, right? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1034.56s)]
*  Typically, you're a Neanderthal, you can't eat, you can't hunt, you die, right? But we know that [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1039.68s)]
*  members of this harbor take care of him, right? So we know that at some level, early in our [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1044.16s)]
*  evolutionary history, we actually developed altruism. We have examples of chimpanzees who [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1048.16s)]
*  actually have a basic understanding of fairness, right? If you give a chimpanzee two grapes, right, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1054.48s)]
*  and his buddy gets three, right? He actually freaks out, right? But you give both chimps three [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1059.28s)]
*  grapes and they're good. We have examples of parrots. Except for the greedy chimps. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1064.4s)]
*  Except for the greedy chimps. They want four grapes. They want four grapes, you know, those do exist, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1069.0400000000002s)]
*  right? But we have similar examples where we do animal tests, right? And... So morality is [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1073.0400000000002s)]
*  intrinsic. I think... So it precedes science. I think that actually a better way to define it would be [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1078.0s)]
*  that social animals, which we are, right, require some level of morality or... Into what? I'm not [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1084.32s)]
*  disagreeing. Sure. Why do they require that? Because it's the only way that social groups can [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1092.08s)]
*  actually survive, right? That's my point with regards to science. Thank you very much. Is that? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1096.24s)]
*  Precisely the point that you just made, that science has to exist within a moral framework [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1101.44s)]
*  that isn't in itself scientific. How is that not scientific? Well, because it's not derived from [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1105.52s)]
*  the scientific process, as you just indicated. It's not derived from the scientific process. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1110.32s)]
*  It's the fact that we are social animals. We need that to exist as a group. I agree. But you pointed [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1113.92s)]
*  to the morality of Neanderthals, to the morality of chimpanzees. They didn't derive that from science. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1119.52s)]
*  They don't need to. That's not how that works. That's my point. I like that his premises, his [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1125.92s)]
*  firm commitment to this premise of like religion is ever present and it always existed and has [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1131.92s)]
*  taken different forms. So humanity's existence comes after the existence of God and religion. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1137.12s)]
*  Is this like unshakable perspective that he has, even though they're supposed to be having an [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1146.24s)]
*  argument about like science being an observation of all of this observable phenomena and religion [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1151.28s)]
*  basically being a rule set that they have created off of the same observable phenomena [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1159.2s)]
*  that they could not actually observe through the scientific process at that point. But for him, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1170.0s)]
*  it's like, well, religion predates mankind. It's just, everything is religion. Everything [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1179.1200000000001s)]
*  is Christianity. All morality comes from Christianity. Or I guess like, this would be [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1185.6s)]
*  like from a primitive accumulation version of Christianity for Jordan Peterson. I win [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1195.12s)]
*  because I will not shake away from my position. Science explains it. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1201.84s)]
*  Science doesn't explain morality. It doesn't explain how social animals would need to be [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1209.36s)]
*  Well, that's a complicated question. But we see it though. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1213.92s)]
*  Yeah, but explaining the evolution of morality and explaining morality itself aren't the same [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1218.0s)]
*  thing. Okay, so you're asking why does this happen? I ask, yes, that's more accurate. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1222.4s)]
*  Because we're social animals. Okay, oh my god, so fucking boring. Holy shit, I'm gonna fucking die. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1227.68s)]
*  Oh my god, I can't do this. Oh god, Jordan Peterson is so incredibly dull. Like, I feel like he uses [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1232.4s)]
*  being boring as a weapon. I will say, I will say this, I think that modern conservatism has evolved [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1241.04s)]
*  or rather devolved to no longer even entertain the notion of like, being intellectually superior, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1250.72s)]
*  where I think that there is definitely an anti intellectualist slant associated with modern [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1259.2s)]
*  conservatism. And therefore there is no use for the likes of Jordan Peterson anymore. There is [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1264.48s)]
*  no use for the likes of Jordan Peterson. So now people can just like put them in the dustbin of [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1270.0s)]
*  history. Or they're just like, yeah, it's among conservatives anymore. It's a systems based reality. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1275.84s)]
*  Is there a hierarchical structure? Is there a hierarchical structure? Are some things more [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1282.96s)]
*  important than others? Are some things I think that some things lead to more benefit? What is [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1287.76s)]
*  the [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1292.48s)]
*  How are you doing? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I guess since you said morality and purpose [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1298.96s)]
*  cannot be found in science, it would just depend on like what you're referencing. If you're saying [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1302.72s)]
*  a description of your psychological preferences would be considered within science, sure. But I [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1306.5600000000002s)]
*  don't think that you have to say that it comes from science in order to be like an atheist. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1310.0800000000002s)]
*  As an agnostic atheist, I don't know if God exists and I don't believe that a God exists. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1313.52s)]
*  And the only ones that I would really reject would be like the all-knowing, all-powerful, all good, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1317.52s)]
*  perfect notion of God that plenty of Christians like prescribe themselves. So I guess- How is that [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1321.52s)]
*  relevant to this claim? You're basing a position of morality and purpose in some like notion of [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1326.08s)]
*  God that isn't the same type of notion of God that typical Christians would prescribe. Your notion [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1332.0s)]
*  of God is- What typical Christians? Yeah, typically when I talk to Christians, they say that they [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1336.72s)]
*  believe in all-knowing. How about Cardinal Newman, who defined God as conscience? He's a major [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1340.96s)]
*  influence on all of Catholic social theory. How about that Christian? Sure. So do you believe in [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1346.0s)]
*  the all-knowing, all-powerful, all good notion of God? What do you mean by believe? Do you think [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1352.0800000000002s)]
*  it's be true? That's the circular definition. What do you mean when you say you believe? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  No. No. I mean, I saw this and he's going to cook him on the semantic side here because again, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1363.44s)]
*  debate lords love- This is like the perfect question to ask a debate lord because [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1372.64s)]
*  Jordan Peterson also is a debate lord of a different sort. He will just like dive into- [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1380.8000000000002s)]
*  He will dive into like establishing definitions for simple concepts like believe. Like what do [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1390.0s)]
*  you mean by believe is an insane fucking question to ask in this debate? How is that circular? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1397.04s)]
*  Because you added no content to the answer by substituting the word true and believe. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1404.8s)]
*  I said you think it to be true. All right. So if you believe something, you stake your life on it. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1412.0s)]
*  What do you mean by that? You live for it and you die for it. That's what I mean by that. It [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1418.08s)]
*  isn't something that you say. It isn't something that's associated with logical- He also always [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1425.52s)]
*  loves to come across as like intense, which you will see in a second is very stupid. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1431.04s)]
*  Insistency. It's not declarative. It's not propositional. It's not a figment of your [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1438.16s)]
*  imagination. It's the presupposition of your attention and your action. And you're either [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1443.76s)]
*  fragmented, in which case you worship multiple gods or there's some unity at the- He's not wrong. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1449.44s)]
*  Okay, dude. No. When asking about whether or not Jordan Peterson believes in an omnipresent [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1455.76s)]
*  god, okay? Like turning the conversation around on what he means by believe versus what Parker [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1464.0s)]
*  means by believe is fucking so silly. It's just, what is your personal fucking opinion? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1472.32s)]
*  That's it. If you can't even establish- if you can't even find like common ground on [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1478.32s)]
*  the English language and its practical application in here, in this conversation, there's no [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1489.52s)]
*  discourse. You can never have a conversation. It will devolve into the most pedantic nonsense. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1494.8s)]
*  The bottom of it that makes you an unstoppable force. Okay, so you're saying that you don't [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1502.08s)]
*  believe something if you wouldn't die for it? Not really, no. Okay. So how would you define [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1507.68s)]
*  belief? Something- Yeah, you would fucking kill yourself if Christianity was eroded [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1512.96s)]
*  in the Western world in order to defend it, even though he won't even fucking recognize that he is [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1520.96s)]
*  a Christian. Can you say- Can I explain? Like I could believe it is the case that this pen exists, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1526.8s)]
*  but if someone like threatened my life, right, I would lie in order to be able to save my life, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1531.52s)]
*  right? Like I think you would do that too. You wouldn't lie to save your life? Don't be so sure. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1536.56s)]
*  You wouldn't lie to save your life? How much do you know about me? I didn't- [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1540.72s)]
*  That's so awesome. He gets so mad. Lie to save my career. I didn't lie to save my clinical practice. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1545.36s)]
*  Would you lie to like save your children, your mom, your dad? I don't think lying would save them. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1552.8s)]
*  Can there ever be a circumstance logically that lying could save someone's life? Yeah, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1557.84s)]
*  and if you're steeped in sin, you're likely to live in circumstances like that. I'll give you [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1561.44s)]
*  an example. If you're like- Dude, what are you doing? I love this combo. This was my favorite [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1565.6s)]
*  because he's just- Bro, he's Sephiroth posting, but as like a religious conservative [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1571.9199999999998s)]
*  who won't even admit that he's Christian. How much do you know about me? I believe in the [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1579.52s)]
*  theory of the dragon of chaos that my daughter almost killed me on multiple occasions. Like when [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1585.28s)]
*  I was addicted to benzos and they sent me to Russia for an experimental cold turkey treatment [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1594.72s)]
*  and I was comatose or after in the recovery process when COVID- [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1603.92s)]
*  When people were getting COVID, my daughter wanted to frolic about with Andrew Tate so hard in [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1612.0s)]
*  Serbia that I almost died again. What is that, if not undeniable proof of the dragon of chaos theory? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1621.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, Peterson's claim is not necessarily wrong. The task of the scientist is not [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1634.32s)]
*  to be concerned with morality or purpose. In fact, that often gets in the way of scientific [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1638.4s)]
*  discovery. People refusing to believe in heliocentrism, for instance, as part of the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1641.52s)]
*  reason why we have ethics boards separate to the scientific community. In Nazi Germany, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1644.48s)]
*  and it is the case that there's Jewish people in your attic and you're trying to protect them, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1649.52s)]
*  would you lie to the Nazis? I would have done everything I bloody well could so I wouldn't be [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1652.64s)]
*  in that situation to begin with. It's a hypothetical and it's not answerable. No, I can't answer a [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1657.44s)]
*  hypothetical like that because it's far- Look, don't play games. If you present me with an [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1663.44s)]
*  intractable moral choice that's stripped of context and you back me into a corner, you're [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1675.92s)]
*  playing game. I just told you I would do everything that I could to make sure that I'm never in that [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1680.24s)]
*  situation. By the time you've got there, you've made so many mistakes that there's nothing you [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1687.92s)]
*  can do. This part was also very, I mean, if you were to take him seriously, if you were to take [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1692.96s)]
*  him at his words, because I don't think he's being sincere ever, but it kind of gives insight into [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1697.68s)]
*  his worldview, which is so stupid. Bad things only happen to bad people because they're being [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1704.32s)]
*  punished with some sort of divine retribution where he's like, I'm not going to entertain your [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1711.1200000000001s)]
*  hypothetical because I would not find myself instead hypothetical. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1717.6799999999998s)]
*  He's just like, would you hide Jews in your addict and lie to the Nazi administrators [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1725.1999999999998s)]
*  during Nazi Germany? Let's say you were born in Nazi Germany. He's like, I would not. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1731.6s)]
*  I would not be in Nazi Germany. It's like, what do you mean? Like what? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1736.32s)]
*  You were just like, escape? I'm so confused. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1741.92s)]
*  Obviously you would lie in that scenario to save their life, but you're like not trying to answer this question for some reason. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1771.92s)]
*  I just told you why. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1776.88s)]
*  Are you anti-fascist? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1778.0s)]
*  Why are you asking that? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1780.72s)]
*  I was just asking, just clarifying. But like, okay, again, you're not answering this hypothetical [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1781.92s)]
*  because you know it shows that you clearly would lie to save someone's life. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1785.76s)]
*  I'm answering it. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1788.24s)]
*  Obviously that's not what the truth is. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1788.96s)]
*  You don't find acceptable. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1789.68s)]
*  Obviously, because I care about the truth. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1791.76s)]
*  I wouldn't be in that scenario. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1792.96s)]
*  Obviously, right? Logically, because that's already happened. Like that's in the past. You don't have [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1794.72s)]
*  a time travel device. We're bringing this logical hypothetical up to show you that in some circumstances [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1798.4s)]
*  that do happen within the real world, you would lie to save people's lives. So your definition of truth [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1803.2s)]
*  isn't actually how we're typically using it. So what you're trying to do is you're trying to muddy [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1807.3600000000001s)]
*  the waters when I ask you like, do you believe this? Do you think this to be true? So you don't [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1810.24s)]
*  actually have to answer the questions. And plenty of Christians don't like that because they clearly [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1813.76s)]
*  see that you don't really like want to be associated with Christianity. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1817.2s)]
*  I can imagine that I was in a situation where the best I could do as a consequence of my previous [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1819.3600000000001s)]
*  mistakes was to tell the least amount of lie I could. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1825.2s)]
*  Oh, look at how long it took for him to say I would fucking save Jews by lying in Nazi Germany. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1828.56s)]
*  Like this should not be extracting a fucking confession out of someone by like clamping his [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1839.04s)]
*  nipples to a car battery. Okay. But the process is resembling that torturous process. What the fuck? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1846.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1855.28s)]
*  Fine. You got me. Like, dude, just why? Why are you? Why are you doing this? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1859.52s)]
*  I could manage. But that would likely indicate that I have made all sorts of catastrophic [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1866.0800000000002s)]
*  catastrophic errors on my way there. So you would lie to save someone's life. So again, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1870.72s)]
*  you do believe it to be true in that circumstance, even though you like lied in that scenario. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1875.44s)]
*  So without the context that I put it in, you were not willing to die. We're not willing to [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1879.44s)]
*  let other people die for it. So that's not what you see to be true then, seemingly. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1883.84s)]
*  You're doing exactly what I said you were doing at the beginning of the conversation. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1890.08s)]
*  You're generating an impossible, restricted, hypothetical with no precursors to back me into [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1894.0s)]
*  a corner. How is it possible? Is there something contradictory about it? Nice to meet you. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1900.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, nice to meet you. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1903.28s)]
*  Okay. Oh, this is the kid. This is the kid that cooked his ass and said, you're nothing. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1904.16s)]
*  Hey, Dr. Peterson. How are you doing? Nice to meet you. What's your name? Danny. You're saying [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1918.0800000000002s)]
*  atheist worship things or people or places, whatever. Can you just be very clear about your [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1922.48s)]
*  definition of worship again? Everybody worships something, even though they might not know it. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1928.0800000000002s)]
*  By the way, you want to know, ironically, I don't even like fully disagree with half of these [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1934.16s)]
*  fucking prompts. It's just that using these prompts at the behest of like undermining atheism [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1938.3200000000002s)]
*  or trying to defend Christianity is silly. This is my, everybody believes something stupid theory. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1944.8000000000002s)]
*  Simply put, attend to prioritize and sacrifice for. Okay. That's it. That's your understanding [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1954.72s)]
*  of worship. Well, I could flesh it out, but that'll do for the time we have. Okay. Do Catholics [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1962.48s)]
*  attend to Mary? Yes. Okay. So do they fit that description of worship? Yes. So you would say [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1967.6s)]
*  Catholics and other people that revere Mary, like the Eastern Orthodox tradition, where they might [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1976.32s)]
*  not put her in the highest place. But you would put it that way. No. You just said it. Now you're [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1981.3600000000001s)]
*  taking it back. There's still a hierarchy. Okay. There's a hierarchy, but in within. There's [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1985.6s)]
*  something at the top. All right. You can worship things below. Mary is quite a ways up the hierarchy, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1990.0s)]
*  but not at the top. Let's go over your definition of worship again. What's your definition of [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1994.16s)]
*  worship? Attend to. Attend to. Do prioritize. Do Catholics? Sacrifice for. What do Catholics [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=1998.08s)]
*  attend to? Do they prioritize Mary over all other human beings? No, I didn't say over all, did I? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2005.12s)]
*  I didn't add that to my definition. You understand. I said there was a hierarchy as well. You attend [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2012.64s)]
*  to something trivially, or you can attend to it deeply. And now you're adding stuff to the [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2017.36s)]
*  definition, but your original definition. I added the hierarchy part at the beginning. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2022.32s)]
*  Are you familiar? You just didn't understand it. Are you familiar with the Immaculate Conception? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2026.3999999999999s)]
*  Why is that relevant? Because you go to a Catholic church, don't you? You've attended recently. You're [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2029.6799999999998s)]
*  interested in Catholicism, aren't you? Sure. All right. Are you familiar with their doctrines? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2033.28s)]
*  Somewhat. Okay. You're familiar. Their doctrines are very deep. How do they regard Mary? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2037.4399999999998s)]
*  Why are you asking me that? Because you're a Christian. You say that. I haven't claimed that. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2041.6s)]
*  Oh, what is this? Is this Christians versus atheists? I don't know. You don't know where [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2046.72s)]
*  you are right now. Don't be a smart ass. Well, either you're a Christian or you're not. I won't [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2051.12s)]
*  talk to you if you're a smart ass. Oh, either you're a Christian or you're not. Which one is it? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2054.7200000000003s)]
*  I could be either of them, but I don't have to tell. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2059.68s)]
*  Ash hadwin la ilaha illallah wa ash hadu anna Muhammad al-abdulla Rasulullah. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2062.0s)]
*  What do you have to say now? Be gone, atheist. That's right. I have said the Shahada. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2069.28s)]
*  Allah is the greatest and Muhammad, peace be upon him, is his prophet. What now, atheist? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2077.04s)]
*  Checkmate. Jordan Peterson is Sunni. Otherwise, why would his name be Jordan? Maybe 5% Shia as well. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2084.8s)]
*  Yeah, I, I agree. You, you don't have to tell me. I was under the impression. I was invited [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2091.2799999999997s)]
*  to talk to a Christian. Am I not talking to a Christian? No, you were invited to, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2098.3199999999997s)]
*  I think everyone should look at the title of the YouTube channel. You're probably in the wrong [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2103.44s)]
*  YouTube video. It used to literally be Christians versus 20 atheists. And then they changed it. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2106.48s)]
*  That's so fucked up. It's so fucked up because the title initially was Christian [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2112.8799999999997s)]
*  versus 20 atheists. And they change. There's such pussies Jubilee. Come on, dude. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2120.08s)]
*  You're really quite something. You aren't tired, but you're really quite nothing, right? You're not [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2126.24s)]
*  a Christian. I'm done with him. No, I'm done with him. They'd rather lose credibility than hold [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2130.16s)]
*  Jordan accountable. Okay. First of all, first of all, lose credibility. It's fucking Jubilee. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2137.12s)]
*  What do you mean lose credibility? Who had credibility for Jubilee? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2144.88s)]
*  Jordan Peterson lost the debate to a child, an atheist child claim atheists, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2156.0s)]
*  except Christian morality, but deny religion is foundational stories. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2160.48s)]
*  Jordan Peterson's framework for understanding Christianity is probably not, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2166.48s)]
*  not the one that the Bible intended. God, I hate these debates so much. I just don't care. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2169.76s)]
*  I don't care about it at all. I feel like the reason why this is the reason why this is [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2176.1600000000003s)]
*  favorite subject matter to cover is because it's so, I don't know. I feel like it's, it's so [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2181.6000000000004s)]
*  inconsequential, but because religion or at least like religious social concepts have dominated the [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2188.1600000000003s)]
*  planet for so long that they can make it seem as though this is a serious subject matter that we [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2197.44s)]
*  need to discuss. You know what I mean? It's circular. So you can just lab debate perv techniques. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2204.48s)]
*  Don't miss this one 5950. This guy also dismantles Jordan Peterson. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2210.7200000000003s)]
*  Theists accept Christian morality, but deny the religion's foundational stories. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2214.4s)]
*  Hi there. It's very nice to meet you. I'm Ian. Hi, Ian. Yes. So God says that you can own people [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2219.44s)]
*  as property. He says that you can beat them with a rod too. He, yeah, this is my favorite type of [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2224.96s)]
*  like debate pervertry. One of them did it to Charlie Kirk as well in Cambridge where he was like, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2230.64s)]
*  okay, you know, you're homophobic because of a semantic misunderstanding and you claim that it's [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2236.88s)]
*  because of like church tradition, but also there's a shit ton of stuff in the Bible and all the [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2244.64s)]
*  different versions. I don't know what they are because I don't, I'm not, you know, even going to [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2251.44s)]
*  entertain theology that much. But like it's the, it's the classic, like different forms of scripture [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2256.48s)]
*  that Christianity chooses not to fucking apply. Like mixing fabrics implies that you must die [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2265.2000000000003s)]
*  a horrible death or eating fucking shellfish and things like that. It's just, you just, you end up [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2273.6s)]
*  cherry picking certain parts of it, which is why I always say, which is why I always say religion is [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2283.7599999999998s)]
*  ideology and that everybody picks and chooses is subject to interpretation. And it's really dumb [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2290.56s)]
*  to design society around it. Man's genocide and Deuteronomy and in numbers and in Samuel, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2299.52s)]
*  I mean, they have a goddamn baby barbecue and numbers. Like is, is all of this in line with [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2307.12s)]
*  Christian ethics? No. So then God doesn't fit within Christian ethics. Well, the biblical library is a [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2313.28s)]
*  continuing story and everything written in it has to be contextualized by the entire text. There's [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2321.28s)]
*  65,000 hyperlinks in the biblical text and you can take pieces of it out, out of context and [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2327.36s)]
*  criticize them. And that's what you're doing. But that's a mistake. I think it's an analytic mistake [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2333.2000000000003s)]
*  because you're putting the cart before the horse. I really don't think so. I think that if we, if we [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2339.44s)]
*  say that something is Christian ethics, then I think that all of the books essential to Christianity [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2344.1600000000003s)]
*  would fit with it, especially if it's like the main character. When we're talking about God. How do you [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2349.28s)]
*  deal with the morality of war? So how do you think you should deal with the morality of war? Sure, sure, sure, sure. Because I feel like the, the morality, like I feel like Christian ethics, like this is kind of, I guess I just think it's like kind of an absurdity to say that God doesn't fit within Christian ethics. But sure, well, we can go on my ethics. That's totally fine. I don't know what you mean by an absurdity. What game are you playing with that question? Well, I just think that it's an absurdity to say that the Christian God doesn't fit within Christian ethics, that like the Christian God isn't like Christian ethical. I didn't say that. I said that the specific statements that you made don't take the context of the stories into [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2353.12s)]
*  account. And so that your analytical approach is faulty. Sure. Don't put words in my mouth. Sure, then let's go to the example. Yeah. So I apologize. So let's go to the example. So in first Samuel 15, three, God says go and slaughter the Amalekites slaughter the men, the women, the children, the infants. What's the justification for that? Is that within? Is that in line with Christian ethics? That's a good question. That's a good question. I don't really know what to do with the terrible blood soaked saturated history of the human past. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2383.12s)]
*  I don't know. And I don't think what you try to do in your own life, as far as I can tell, is to conduct yourself in a manner that makes such things much more unlikely. I totally agree. We're all saddled with the problem of the catastrophes that got us here, aren't we? Yeah, but this one was commanded by God. That's the problem. That's what differentiates it from anything else is that this one, it's God saying go into this atrocity. Do you think that there's ever such a thing as a righteous war? I'm skeptical. I'm not sure. It would probably be situational. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2413.12s)]
*  Well, right, right. Fair enough. But this one certainly wasn't a just war. The context for the Amalekite slaughter is that 400 years earlier, they fought one battle which they lost and God says, that's it. I'm going to wipe them off the face of the goddamn earth. And then 400 years later, he commands the Israelites to genocide their great, great, great, great, great, great grandchildren. That's not a just war at all. And also a genocide is not a war. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2443.12s)]
*  Well, a genocide can be a war, but absolutely. I mean, for Jordan, this is intellectual honesty, a brief moment of intellectual honesty, as he is an advocate for Israel and its unjustifiable genocide. Well, it could be. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2469.04s)]
*  The genocide of the Amalekites, the men, the women and the infants, that's not a war. The infants aren't combatants. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2487.0s)]
*  Look, I already said that it's very difficult to look at blood so past and to know exactly what to do about it. The answer I gave [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2493.0s)]
*  I mean, you can, you can fucking say, imagine misrepresenting history. What do you mean? You can, you can say that it's like fucked up to kill babies, right? That's like, Dick, why? Why is it so hard for this man to ever say it's fucked up to kill babies? Like that's crazy. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2502.0s)]
*  That emerges across time that has its roots in the Old Testament, for example, with its restrictions against murder specifically, that makes itself manifest in the Christian texts as the insistence on voluntary self-sacrifice as the foundational belief. That's a profoundly anti-violence ethos. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2532.96s)]
*  Do you have the belief in your theology? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2551.96s)]
*  Well, what do you think of that? Wait a sec. Now, redress what I just said. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2553.96s)]
*  So I'm about to address it, but I'm addressing it with a question. Do you think that God is by his very essence perfect? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2557.92s)]
*  You'll have to provide more. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2562.92s)]
*  Sure, just like maximally great in all the great qualities. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2564.92s)]
*  I think it's a definition. Sure. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2566.92s)]
*  Yeah, like flawless. Yeah. So does a flawless thing change? Wait a sec. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2568.92s)]
*  Does a flawless thing reveal more and better information over time? Or would a flawless thing say, here's what's good. Here is the absolute good thing to do at all circumstances in time. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2571.92s)]
*  Wow, we know some of that. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2582.92s)]
*  Tell the truth. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2584.92s)]
*  That's totally fine, but presumably... [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2587.88s)]
*  No, no, no, no. You don't get to state over that. That's totally fine. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2589.88s)]
*  It's a straw man of my position. It's a straw man of the argument. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2591.88s)]
*  So the argument is that God... [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2594.88s)]
*  Wait a sec. You said find one maxim that's transcendent across situations. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2596.88s)]
*  I didn't say any of those words. I'm not sure what conversation you're a part of. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2602.88s)]
*  Don't be a smartass. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2606.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2608.88s)]
*  Seriously, I mean it. If we're going to have a serious conversation, conduct yourself properly. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2610.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2614.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2617.84s)]
*  So in my mind, I guess by my lights, a perfect being doesn't change. A perfect being, if they're maximally good, maximally moral... [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2619.84s)]
*  Does our understanding of the perfect being change? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2627.84s)]
*  Our understanding might, but presumably what the perfect being is revealing... [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2629.84s)]
*  I agree. How do we distinguish between that though at the human level? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2632.84s)]
*  How do we distinguish between... [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2636.84s)]
*  Between our transforming understanding of perfection and perfection itself. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2638.84s)]
*  Between our understanding... [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2642.84s)]
*  Presumably a perfect being would be revealing all of these aspects all the time. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2645.8s)]
*  Especially if God's outside of time. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2649.8s)]
*  I don't know how a God who's outside of time is revealing different things at different times. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2651.8s)]
*  That just seems incoherent to me. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2655.8s)]
*  Imagine something that's perfect and complete. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2657.8s)]
*  And it's trying to communicate with creatures who are anything but that. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2660.8s)]
*  While they're going to get it wrong. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2664.8s)]
*  Now wait a sec. Do you blame that on the interpreters or the phenomena itself? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2666.8s)]
*  For example, are you perfect in attending to your conscience? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2672.76s)]
*  Hold on. At the point in time when God is literally the one who created us, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2675.76s)]
*  He could have created us in a way where we would always be receptive to these principles. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2677.76s)]
*  Where we don't have to go across a learning curve where maybe we'll understand... [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2681.76s)]
*  Not maintain free will. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2684.76s)]
*  Thousands of years in the future maybe we'll do it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2686.76s)]
*  Also if you believe in an all-knowing God then free will is impossible. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2688.76s)]
*  Wait a sec. Let's not go to that yet. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2691.76s)]
*  You threw free will into the mix. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2694.76s)]
*  Well that was the answer to your question. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2696.76s)]
*  You said why wouldn't God... [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2698.76s)]
*  A thousand king philosophers would disagree with you. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2701.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And a thousand years of or at least like the last 50 years of philosophers would disagree with you. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2704.7200000000003s)]
*  These analytic philosophers. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2709.7200000000003s)]
*  People like Graham Oppi make arguments about the incompatibility of omniscience and free will. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2711.7200000000003s)]
*  That if God created this world, if He chose this world instead of that world, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2717.7200000000003s)]
*  then He makes it causally inevitable every single action that you are going to make. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2720.7200000000003s)]
*  If He made a world where we were just electrons in love, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2724.7200000000003s)]
*  then none of this would have happened. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2727.7200000000003s)]
*  But making us in this world, knowing exactly what's going to happen in the future, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2730.68s)]
*  it makes all of those events inevitable, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2733.68s)]
*  which means that they're all causally determined, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2735.68s)]
*  which means that we have no free will if you believe in an all-knowing God. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2737.68s)]
*  I hate to be a philosophy PhD guy in the chat, but both of these dudes suck, lol. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2741.68s)]
*  I hate this entire process. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2745.68s)]
*  But I do like that they pissed off Jordan Peterson. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2749.68s)]
*  That's what I like. Making me rip my hair out. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2753.68s)]
*  I like that they frustrated Peterson and made him look and feel small. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2757.64s)]
*  But yes, this is why I used to constantly shit on philosophy majors [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2761.64s)]
*  and also Reddit atheists in general. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2765.64s)]
*  God that made everything? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2769.64s)]
*  No, have it your way. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2771.64s)]
*  So then the free will of the Odyssey fails? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2773.64s)]
*  Well, it fails for you. That doesn't mean you've disproved it. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2775.64s)]
*  Do you want to respond to the argument? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2777.64s)]
*  Yes, you tried to make a case for a causally deterministic universe. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2779.64s)]
*  I don't think there's any evidence for that at all. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2783.64s)]
*  Okay, so God could have created a different universe than the one that he created? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2786.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2788.6s)]
*  Okay, so then there's going to be a double bind, right? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2789.6s)]
*  So either he couldn't have done it, in which case he lacks a power, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2791.6s)]
*  or he could have done it, in which case we don't have free will, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2793.6s)]
*  because he chose this world instead of that world, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2796.6s)]
*  making the events of this world instead of that world inevitable [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2798.6s)]
*  with his infallible knowledge. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2801.6s)]
*  I don't understand where you're headed. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2803.6s)]
*  Which means that the free will defense fails. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2805.6s)]
*  Like I said, if you want to have it fail, no problem. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2807.6s)]
*  I don't know why it's relevant to the issue we're discussing. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2809.6s)]
*  Do you acknowledge that under your view free will doesn't exist? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2811.6s)]
*  No. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2813.6s)]
*  Then do you want to respond to the argument? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2814.6s)]
*  You'll have to phrase it more clearly so that someone like me can understand it. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2816.6s)]
*  Yeah, gotcha. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2819.6s)]
*  So God already knows in advance everything that's going to happen, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2821.6s)]
*  which means that by making this world instead of that world, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2824.6s)]
*  everything is inevitable, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2826.6s)]
*  which means that God's act of causing this world instead of that world... [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2828.6s)]
*  Inevitable doesn't mean determined. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2832.6s)]
*  It's causally inevitable if God chooses this world instead of that world. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2834.6s)]
*  Causally inevitable means determined. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2836.6s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2838.6s)]
*  Absolutely, yes it does. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2840.6s)]
*  You have it your way. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2842.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2844.6s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2846.6s)]
*  If someone is an atheist, why do they spend all their time researching religion to debate it? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2848.6s)]
*  It feels like a snark page for God. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2850.6s)]
*  Basically, I love that. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2852.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2854.6s)]
*  I am of the mind that very few people in the process of these sorts of debates [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2856.6s)]
*  actually move away from their religious framework. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2862.6s)]
*  I think it's like especially unsuccessful. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2866.6s)]
*  What's the saying? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2870.6s)]
*  You can't logic. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2872.6s)]
*  You can't use logic to untangle someone's position [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2874.6s)]
*  if they didn't arrive at that position through logical thinking. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2881.6s)]
*  And Reddit atheist debates are basically trying to disprove that point. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2886.6s)]
*  You're literally talking to a person that did not arrive at this position [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2895.6s)]
*  by thinking through it logically in almost every single one of these circumstances. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2902.6s)]
*  So it's truly an exercise in futility. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2910.6s)]
*  You're wrong. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2916.6s)]
*  I moved away from religion because of atheist debates. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2918.6s)]
*  Good on you. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2920.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2922.6s)]
*  Religious feelings in modernity have almost entirely collapsed in developed nations. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2924.6s)]
*  Do you think that that is a byproduct of debates and people encountering debates? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2936.6s)]
*  Or do you think that there is, I don't know, the expansion of scientific research [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2942.6s)]
*  that ends up plugging holes that previously religion tried to answer? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2952.6s)]
*  Both? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2959.6s)]
*  No, it's not both. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2960.6s)]
*  One is the actual truth. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2962.6s)]
*  The other one is just you not realizing that that played a major role, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2965.6s)]
*  not playing a major role in your life because you thought like, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2971.6s)]
*  oh, it's just because I watched this one debate. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2974.6s)]
*  Why are you making a binary choice? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2977.6s)]
*  Because I just don't believe that people move away from believing religion [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2979.6s)]
*  as a consequence of watching someone get bested, like a religious person get bested. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2986.6s)]
*  I'm sure that plays a role for some. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2991.6s)]
*  I'm sure that plays a role in some. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2994.6s)]
*  I'm not discounting that. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2996.6s)]
*  But obviously, there is a much larger, much more consequential systemic change at play, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=2997.6s)]
*  especially considering that in many circumstances, like I already said, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3007.6s)]
*  no one is born religious. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3016.6s)]
*  You learn religious. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3019.6s)]
*  You learn to become religious. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3021.6s)]
*  It's social conditioning. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3023.6s)]
*  And it's actually an incredible amount of social conditioning that is required to maintain, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3025.6s)]
*  especially at a very early age, to maintain that indoctrination. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3033.6s)]
*  I lost believe in God because I'm short. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3039.6s)]
*  Most people don't logic their way out of it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3041.6s)]
*  That's insane, dude. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3044.6s)]
*  Straight up, I became an atheist as a teenager when I realized [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3048.6s)]
*  no just God would make me five-four. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3052.6s)]
*  I just realized you being agnostic means you're a religion-centrist, lol. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3056.6s)]
*  I just don't care. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3059.6s)]
*  I don't care, one way or another. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3061.6s)]
*  I don't believe it's religion that actually makes people fundamentalist, for example. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3063.6s)]
*  I think it's people's material conditions that make them predisposed towards fundamentalist attitudes. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3068.6s)]
*  Religion is secondary. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3075.6s)]
*  That's my belief. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3077.6s)]
*  I'm not in any way, shape or form spiritual, I guess. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3079.6s)]
*  I don't care me, Sanchez. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3084.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3086.6s)]
*  I think you're under-representing the impact of the baby because of your own personal bias against debate lords. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3087.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3091.6s)]
*  Do well. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3093.6s)]
*  I so fucking tired. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3094.6s)]
*  I've only done seven hours. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3095.6s)]
*  I think Jordan Peterson cooked me. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3097.6s)]
*  He destroyed me. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3100.6s)]
*  Chat. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3101.6s)]
*  One final note on this. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3102.6s)]
*  It has been satisfying watching Peterson's reputation plummet back in 2018. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3103.6s)]
*  He was the most influential public intellectual in the Western world. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3107.6s)]
*  Now he is right. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlHJlTaM7cg&t=3110.6s)]
