# New Setup For Hasan's Room
**HasanAbi:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo)
*  It's incredibly annoying. I know I noticed it this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=0.0s)]
*  Anyway, look, I'll tell you what happened. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=3.0s)]
*  So last night, last night, the wonderful Hasan of a gaming team came over [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=5.5s)]
*  and we made some serious adjustments. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Blackout curtain dimmer on the LED light. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=17.1s)]
*  I actually put the once upon a time in Los Angeles photo up myself, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=21.5s)]
*  but you can't really see it that well. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=27.5s)]
*  We got a blackout curtain behind me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=29.6s)]
*  The 15 frames per second is probably going to be annoying [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=37.2s)]
*  and a lot of people are going to get mad. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=41.2s)]
*  That is the one thing I need to fix. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=42.5s)]
*  I think but aside from that, the lighting has been fixed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Virtually everything has been fixed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=50.3s)]
*  Okay, are you dropping frames with the F? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=52.7s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=55.1s)]
*  I'm not dropping frames. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=56.0s)]
*  Oh my God, you guys are going to piss me off. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=57.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=59.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=60.8s)]
*  I'm going to fix the I'm going to fix the frame rate. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  This is this wasn't my this wasn't my personal choice. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=63.3s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=69.5s)]
*  It's the cameras frame rate. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=70.1s)]
*  I'm not like I can't believe it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=71.8s)]
*  We're literally two minutes in and people are already being annoying. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=74.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=77.1s)]
*  Anyway, folks, this is part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=77.7s)]
*  about what's going on in the world of a son outside of a pike room [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=83.8s)]
*  between time period where I press the stop streaming button and press the start [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  streaming button. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=87.8s)]
*  It is 64 degrees and sunny here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=88.7s)]
*  Yeah, we got a dimmer on the neon light, which is why it's not blown out any longer. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=91.7s)]
*  And we have get Kaia 6 XXL bed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=96.6s)]
*  What the hell is that baby bed? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=99.6s)]
*  I know I'm going to get Kaia another bed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=101.1s)]
*  This is just a older bed that she used to use when she was a little baby that I [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=102.6s)]
*  substituted the other bed for because it's broken as you guys know, Kaia [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=107.2s)]
*  broker baby bed yesterday with because she's fat and she's a fat ass. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=110.2s)]
*  Let's be real. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=115.1s)]
*  That's the reality. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=115.8s)]
*  Anyway, folks, are you covering the Jubilee drama? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=117.9s)]
*  The participants are telling people not to watch the vid. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=121.1s)]
*  I am not familiar with what happened what took place. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=124.0s)]
*  I don't really watch a lot of Jubilee. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=127.0s)]
*  So that's super easy for me to not watch that one as well. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=128.6s)]
*  Anyway, the shells without lighting look cool. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=132.0s)]
*  They do have lighting. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=134.7s)]
*  The lighting is just dimmed down and it's orange now instead of the blue that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=136.2s)]
*  it was. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=141.3s)]
*  But also why is the camera for FPS? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=142.7s)]
*  The cameras frame rates are different and that's because we had to tweak a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  bunch of stuff budget frame rate. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=151.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to I want to don't fix the camera. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=154.0s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  No, because literally the this is the most autistic community on the platform. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  So if I don't fix the frame rate, everyone's brains will explode and if [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=163.2s)]
*  they will explode my brain in the process of exploding their brain. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  Okay, like that's the issue. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=175.0s)]
*  It's incredibly annoying. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=177.0s)]
*  I know I noticed it this morning. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=178.5s)]
*  Anyway, look, I'll tell you what happened. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=180.9s)]
*  So last night last night the wonderful Hassan of a gaming team came over and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  we we made some serious adjustments blackout curtain dimmer on the LED [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  light. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=197.9s)]
*  I actually put the once upon a time in Los Angeles photo up myself, but you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=198.8s)]
*  can't really see it that well and really annoying when you talk like this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=205.2s)]
*  Yeah, how about how about it's really annoying when I get started as I'm [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=210.9s)]
*  trying to, you know, make a stream work make this like a professional [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=215.8s)]
*  broadcast and virtually everyone loses their mind instantly because they [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=220.7s)]
*  go the FPS is too low, which is not even all that significant of an issue. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=225.2s)]
*  Like it's just an issue when I move around too much and it like looks you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=230.0s)]
*  can see the frames basically like you you see less I'm putting the cameras [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=235.2s)]
*  on a monitor mount basically making the cameras like much easier to move [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=239.9s)]
*  around and stuff without much issue. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=248.5s)]
*  Anyway, but why is it so dark in your room? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=249.1s)]
*  It's just how it is. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=253.9s)]
*  We took a little David took a monitor mount and reconfigured it to basically [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=255.0s)]
*  sent you a message on how to go back to 60 FPS. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=262.2s)]
*  No, I know how to go back to 60 FPS. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=264.2s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=266.2s)]
*  But yeah here I'll do it right now. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=268.3s)]
*  I'll do it right now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=270.8s)]
*  I tweaked around a little bit this morning as well with the with the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=272.4s)]
*  cameras, but hold on one of the best things that one of the best things [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=275.4s)]
*  that they did also was they applied a tether so that I can just like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=279.6s)]
*  easily change the camera setup using the internet from the computer, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=285.0s)]
*  which is awesome. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  That is a that is a major majorly helpful thing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=295.09999999999997s)]
*  Here look at that boom instantly better except we got to go up a little [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  bit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=305.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=305.2s)]
*  All right shutter speed. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=306.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  We'll do ISO. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=308.9s)]
*  We'll tweak the ISO is still already changed this to 4k. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  I already put that on 4k 50 or K 60 FPS already did that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=314.20000000000005s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=319.0s)]
*  Is this better? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=319.3s)]
*  No, it's too dark. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay, calm down chat. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=322.1s)]
*  Oh wait, I went the wrong direction. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=324.70000000000005s)]
*  How about now? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  It's not as dark but it's still frame by frame. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=327.6s)]
*  Maybe it's the OBS and not the camera. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  It's definitely the camera. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=333.6s)]
*  I don't know why the the frame rate is not like I don't know why the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=334.8s)]
*  frame rate is tweaked. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=338.8s)]
*  It's getting better. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=340.1s)]
*  I think anyway. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=341.0s)]
*  Adjust shutter speed. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm doing that shut up. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=344.3s)]
*  I am doing that the problem with the shutter speed. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=346.0s)]
*  However, is that like the higher the shutter speed goes the darker [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  it gets and the darker it goes like here. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=354.5s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=357.5s)]
*  Let me let me do this on my own. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=358.0s)]
*  I'm not going to get some feedback from you guys. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=359.2s)]
*  Is that better? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=361.8s)]
*  No, it's too dark. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=363.8s)]
*  But is that better in terms of the frames? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=365.0s)]
*  I know it's too dark. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=367.3s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=368.4s)]
*  I know I'm not trying to get feedback from chat. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=368.9s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=370.8s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=371.3s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=371.5s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=371.8s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=372.0s)]
*  Shut up chat. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=372.3s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=373.1s)]
*  I'm not getting feedback from you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=373.5s)]
*  Okay, calm down. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG189S-oNo&t=374.7s)]
