# This “Fight” Against Antisemitism Is Out Of Control | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo)
*  Now that in and of itself is not inherently anti-semitic. That's just like a joke about how [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=0.0s)]
*  um the the false conflation of uh of of israel with judaism has been brought about. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=5.44s)]
*  Why are the are there more dog whistles? Dude, Gen Z has different dog whistles than the generations [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=14.24s)]
*  prior. That's what I'm saying. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=18.88s)]
*  To begin this morning, the legal battle between the Trump administration and Mahmoud Khalil, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=24.8s)]
*  the Columbia University graduate student and pro-Palestinian activist it intends to deport. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=31.04s)]
*  A few days ago, Aaron Moriarty talked with his wife who's expecting the couple's first child [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  next month. You know my my husband was taken away from me in the middle of the night. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=44.08s)]
*  Um it was one of the most terrifying times of of my life. I don't think I've ever experienced [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=49.2s)]
*  anything scarier than that. Nor Abdullah, a 28 year old dentist born and raised in Michigan, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=53.6s)]
*  has suddenly found herself in the center of a storm she never saw coming. She and her husband, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=60.0s)]
*  30 year old Mahmoud Khalil, had been living in Columbia University housing while he completed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=66.64s)]
*  his master's degree and they awaited the birth of their first child. I was so excited like we were [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=73.12s)]
*  setting everything up for like the nursery and his clothes and Mahmoud was so excited too. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=79.04s)]
*  That all changed on the evening of March 8th when federal agents arrived at their door. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=86.48s)]
*  And he was like are you Mahmoud Khalil? Mahmoud said yes and the man said we're with the police [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  you have to come with us. What's going through your mind at that point? I was scared. I was [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  terrified. Yeah they just like handcuffed him and I don't know what to do. Abdullah used her phone [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=102.48s)]
*  to document what happened next. At this point Mahmoud was like go take the keys grab my green card. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=108.56s)]
*  He thought maybe like if he shows the green card you know we'll be fine. Did you think that if you [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=116.48s)]
*  showed the fact that your husband was a legal resident with a green card that he'd be okay? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Because I was like this is just a misunderstanding they're going to take him away they're going to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=128.56s)]
*  take him to 26 Federal Plaza see that he has a green card he'll be home in a few hours. Excuse me [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=132.08s)]
*  there's nobody that they're not talking to me I don't know excuse me the lawyer would like to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  speak to somebody oh my god they're literally running away from me. She has not seen her husband [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=143.36s)]
*  since. Khalil who has been in an immigration detention center in Louisiana for two weeks [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  is one of many international students that the Trump administration says it plans to deport [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=156.24s)]
*  for their alleged actions in student protests on college campuses. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=162.72s)]
*  The unrest began in the fall of 2023 following the October 7th Hamas terror attack on Israel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=170.32s)]
*  When Israel retaliated with deadly bombings in Gaza students across the country erupted [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  in protest. At Columbia University in New York demonstrations against the war while mostly peaceful [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=185.2s)]
*  also led to the occupation and vandalizing of buildings and what many Jewish students [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  described as a threatening anti-semitic atmosphere on campus. We know now that there are students in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=203.92s)]
*  our class that simply hate us because we're Jewish. Nor Abdullah says her husband. I hate [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=211.52s)]
*  this narrative so much the American government is so unimaginably dumb and the media is so stupid [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=217.68s)]
*  that like the hysterics of students on campus like the hysterical perspective [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=225.44s)]
*  of a pro-Israel Jewish student on Columbia campus is more important than the first amendment [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=232.8s)]
*  it's more important than being able to say hey don't do a f***ing genocide please [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=241.36s)]
*  don't associate with a country that is doing a genocide it is like it's hysteria there's nothing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=248.4s)]
*  to it other than f***ing hysteria dudes who are like no my feelings are hurt I'm scared like the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=256.48s)]
*  what the f*** are you saying you're scared like these student-led protests are also led by Jewish [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=264.16s)]
*  students like what are you talking about yeah real terrorism is when when you actually have to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=269.2s)]
*  listen to the hysterical opinion of conservative students on campus that's what's up that's what [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  real is when have conservative students not talked about how fearful they are on college campuses man [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=280.24s)]
*  they always talked about it they're like oh libtards run the campuses we hate it they always want to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=285.68s)]
*  save spaces and s*** okay Khalil a Palestinian born in Syria became the lead negotiator between [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=292.0s)]
*  protesters and the universities this encampment is a minor inconvenience compared to the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=300.0s)]
*  generational shaping events taking place now in Gaza people really trusted him to to be good in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=307.04s)]
*  that role because he's so calm and good under pressure the president wants the but in the days [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=314.72s)]
*  following Khalil's arrest White House press secretary Caroline Levitt painted a quite [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=319.92s)]
*  different picture this is an individual who organized group protests that not only disrupted [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=326.0s)]
*  college campus classes and harassed Jewish American students and made them feel unsafe [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  on their own college campus but also distributed pro-hamas propaganda you also know that the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  press secretary said that your husband circulated pro-hamas flyers did he that's not true is [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=345.2s)]
*  Mahmoud pro-hamas these are accusations that the Trump administration keeps pushing on him [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=354.56s)]
*  um but what do you say to those I think it's ridiculous it's disgusting that that that's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=361.28s)]
*  what they're resorting to that that's the tactic that they're using to to make him look like this [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=366.64s)]
*  person that he's not literally it's so simple he just does not want his people to be murdered and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=371.12s)]
*  killed he doesn't want to see little kids limbs being blown off you know the university led us to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=376.0s)]
*  led us to the situation unfortunately through bringing the police here Mahmoud Khalil has not [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=381.44s)]
*  been formally charged with any crimes and the government has showed no evidence he provided [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=387.52s)]
*  material support to terrorist groups instead Khalil's been arrested and detained under the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=392.88s)]
*  immigration act that allows the secretary of state to deport any person whose presence or [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=400.08s)]
*  activities would quote have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the u.s. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=407.2s)]
*  if you are in this country to promote hamas to promote organizations to participate in vandalism [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=415.28s)]
*  to participate in actual rebellion and riots on campus we never would have let you in if we had [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=420.4s)]
*  known that if you violate the terms of your visitation you are going to leave in fact Khalil [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=425.28s)]
*  was never charged with vandalism on campus cbs news asked the state department and the department [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=430.23999999999995s)]
*  of homeland security for comment we did not receive a response this is incredibly rare what [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=436.96s)]
*  happened to Khalil isn't it there are many things about this that I think are are sort of without [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=444.0s)]
*  precedent or with very little precedent I was really shocked Lindsay Nash an associate professor [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  at Cardozo school of law in manhattan teaches and practices immigration law they haven't said that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=454.96s)]
*  he's committed a crime that makes him deportable they haven't said he's committed any kind of crime [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  at all what's more says nash the provision that the government relies on was once determined to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=466.08s)]
*  be too vague and unconstitutional the federal judge who made that ruling judge Maryam Barry [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=472.64s)]
*  president trump's sister who died in 2023 her decision was ultimately overturned on procedural [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=480.64s)]
*  grounds so this particular provision that secretary of state rubio is leaning on [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=488.32s)]
*  is really untested I think it is I think we'll have to see and court okay I didn't know that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=495.76s)]
*  that's crazy as a jew personally I'm worried that they're stifling free speech in the name of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=502.08s)]
*  anti-semitism people will see that and start resenting Jewish people and then actual anti-semitism [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=505.92s)]
*  start happening yeah it's already happening that's literally happening already dude all of this [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=509.76s)]
*  conflation between Israel and Judaism is teaching people that all this baby murder is something that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=514.96s)]
*  Jews love and that the American government will take any action against people who dare criticize [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=521.12s)]
*  this baby to protect the Jewish people in this country they keep conflating it is a dangerous [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=528.0s)]
*  conflation it's a false conflation and yes it is already creating a shit ton of anti-semitism [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=534.48s)]
*  in this country and just like and just like the only pro-labor sentiment on mainstream news was [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=542.48s)]
*  coming from the likes of Tucker Carlson who is a WASP nationalist if the only permissible and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=552.08s)]
*  popular anti-Israel right-wingers many of which who are anti-semitic like openly and if that's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=559.12s)]
*  the only game in town people are going to say I'm anti-Israel because I'm anti-semitic the Candace [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=566.64s)]
*  Owens's and the freshen fits and the Sneakos and the the the Dan Bolzarian's of the world [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=573.76s)]
*  and even the Tucker Carlson's of the world are the most visible anti-Israel advocates in this [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=581.76s)]
*  country right now collectively they are presented as the the sea of anti-Israel sent state sentiment [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=590.24s)]
*  and liberals on the other hand are focusing their efforts on people like myself people like Mahmoud [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=601.04s)]
*  Khalil like or refusing to defend people like Mahmoud Khalil I'd argue you're up there with [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=608.56s)]
*  what you'd argue that I'm up there with like anti-semitic statements or you'd argue that I'm [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=615.3599999999999s)]
*  up there in terms of like being a visible anti-Zionist in this country I am up there [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=620.16s)]
*  but my reach my popularity no no I understand what you meant you meant like in terms of popularity [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  my reach and popularity is nothing it pales in comparison to Candace Owens [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=633.12s)]
*  Candace Owens every single day covers another anti-semitic conspiracy on her broadcast like I [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=641.5999999999999s)]
*  see it I see the clips on my Twitter timeline because Twitter is just dominated by Nazis [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=649.12s)]
*  every other day there's a new thing where she's like yep it's the Jews again doing Jewish shit [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=657.2800000000001s)]
*  that is the extent of her commentary it is reactionary and it is an incredibly easy to [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=663.44s)]
*  understand message and it's a message that goes along with what Jake Tapper is saying too [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=673.6s)]
*  because remember dual loyalty being an anti-semitic trope is true and yet pro-Israel people [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=680.88s)]
*  constantly invoke the dual loyalty trope but in a woke manner so if the right-wingers are saying [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=689.68s)]
*  dual loyalty in a woke Lee manner as well by the way right wingers were pro-Israel are saying all [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=695.92s)]
*  Jews love Israel this is like shut the fuck up you can't say anything about it and liberals are [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=702.0s)]
*  saying dual loyalty in the exact same way and then the anti-semitic people are saying dual loyalty [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=707.2800000000001s)]
*  then the overwhelming media narrative on this issue is dual loyalty Jews love Israel Jews love [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=713.36s)]
*  the baby murder it's their favorite fucking thing that is literally what we are teaching this next [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=720.72s)]
*  generation a generation that for the first time ever perhaps has actually recognized that what [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=726.96s)]
*  Israel's doing is wrong now you either address that by going yeah what Israel's doing is wrong [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=732.08s)]
*  but it has nothing to do with Judaism or you think that you can defend Israel's actions with [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=739.12s)]
*  the old school method of trying to suppress any sort of criticism against Israel and if you've [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=745.6800000000001s)]
*  done this for 70 fucking years if you've been able to successfully defend Israel for 70 plus years [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=751.76s)]
*  by saying oh dude you're anti-semitic shut the fuck up why are you being anti-semitic what do [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=757.84s)]
*  you want nazi shut the fuck up if you have been able to successfully do that for the past 70 years [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmL_Ll39wLo&t=762.16s)]
