# Trump Promised To Support Palestine Just To Win Votes | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI)
*  tens of millions of dollars of work. Okay. Straight up. It's akin to lighting $10 million [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=0.0s)]
*  on fire. You understand when someone goes and knocks on a door and has a direct back [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=8.32s)]
*  and forth or someone calls someone a voter, a potential voter, and has this back and forth. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=13.6s)]
*  And they mark that as like, Oh, unresponsive. Anyway, I think I know what your problem is. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=18.3s)]
*  This is the same computer that you brought to Japan. No chatter. This is my normal desktop. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=27.76s)]
*  Yes. The analysis was sound. The prediction was off. Sometimes your insults are a bit [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=32.08s)]
*  graphic for my brain. Fair. Another one, I think is something I've thought about a lot. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  It's the, it's the Ukraine stuff and my initial reaction to react gate. I corrected you over [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  something tiny linguistically, but it made a difference. And you immediately backtrack [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=48.44s)]
*  respect where respect is due three years of wrong prediction though. What do you mean? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  I think that I, Ukrainian war is three years. What do you mean? I'm confused by this. The [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=55.56s)]
*  people who think this about your clip watchers. Yeah. Yeah. Bernie's healthcare donors are, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=60.64s)]
*  are people that work in the healthcare sector and people that work in medicine, people that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=66.16s)]
*  work in the pharmaceutical companies all the way down to like, when you are donating to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=70.84s)]
*  a, when you're donating to a political campaign, you say where you work, you write your place [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  of business. Like you write your employer. Okay. And then it gets logged as being from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=81.0s)]
*  that sector. You were wrong about closing a pocket with a certain someone with us more [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=87.8s)]
*  of a hindsight, 20, 20, that kind of thing. Yeah, no, that's not anyway. There's a lot [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=91.52s)]
*  of chatter about donations to Bernie Sanders, 2020 presidential campaign from the pharmaceutical [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=96.16s)]
*  industry. To be clear, our data on industry, giving roles up contributions from individuals [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=99.16s)]
*  who work in the industry impacts corporations and not donate to campaigns. So that's the, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=102.94s)]
*  see that and they think they understand the situation and they think that place. Good. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=109.12s)]
*  Okay. Well, I'm glad I have it. Did you miss yours in? No, I was able to, I was able to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=116.12s)]
*  make it work. The top blue check reply doesn't even know how political donors work. How do [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=121.48s)]
*  we know when pharma employees donate? Oh my God, dude, I'm losing it. Like so much of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=126.72s)]
*  American political discourse revolves around, I don't know a certain thing and now I'm going [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=132.24s)]
*  to make it your problem. Like that's just what this is. I don't know how something works [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=137.84s)]
*  and it's actually your fault. And I'm not going to search. I'm not going to learn. I'm [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=143.72s)]
*  not invested in the truth at all. And it's your issue now. It's your fault now. I think [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=148.6s)]
*  you are wrong. I think you were wrong about the streamers work harder socially than other [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=154.28s)]
*  professions. I get what you were trying to say, but try being in the service industry. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  Big dog. I know your job is hard, but there are a lot of benefits that others don't give [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=161.52s)]
*  you. I think you do. And you pulled back and self corrected a little bit. I think that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=165.24s)]
*  was big of you. Wait, what? No, you can't say, I think you're wrong. And then literally [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  then repeat what I said. No, that, that doesn't count. Okay. What the hell? See, this is, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=176.44s)]
*  there are instances where I think, you know, I say things incorrectly. Okay. But then there [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  are also people that literally clipped me entirely out of context and then brigade and then, you [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=191.48s)]
*  know, Keemstar and the like jump on it. It's like coming in here and being like, you're [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=197.92s)]
*  wrong. Big dog. I know you've been a massive advocate for for-profit healthcare, but honestly, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=202.44s)]
*  I'm glad that you're finally coming to the conclusion that like profits should not be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=208.88s)]
*  in the healthcare sector. Like that's, that's ridiculous. I mean, about how your job is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=212.54s)]
*  I know. And I never took you as that. Oh my God. I think the easiest way to understand [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=217.64s)]
*  my position on this is that I don't work any other job. This is what I do. I have the freedom [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=222.84s)]
*  to be able to go and work another job. If I thought it was easier to do that job, I [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=228.32s)]
*  would do that job. Okay. That's it. Anyway, is this the struggle session right now? Or [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=232.2s)]
*  charters bring up every one of your indiscretions and clips they saw out of context now? I know [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=239.28s)]
*  man, you got people talking shit, then apologize themselves for you. So you don't have to do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=243.28s)]
*  shit. Lamar, what do you mean? Anyway, have you seen the news on the white house faith [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  office? No, I have not. I know you don't do it for the money, but I'm wondering if you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  would stop if you didn't get as much money as you do now. I mean, for many years before [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=254.4s)]
*  I got to this position, I wasn't making much money and I still was doing it with no clear [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=258.0s)]
*  indication that I would ever be this successful. I never assumed that I would get to this level [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  of success on this platform. And, and I still did it also even right now. I could just quit, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=267.76s)]
*  but I don't. And the reason why I don't so depressing truck streamer, ripped by Democrats [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=276.08s)]
*  for Musk protest. Okay. Wait, wait, why is everything in italics now? What is going on [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=280.48s)]
*  with my computer, dude? Senator Sanders joins us now. You talk about an oligarchy running [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=285.92s)]
*  the white house. You have billionaires. How did everything turn into italics? Even the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=290.24s)]
*  captions. I don't know what's going on, but my shit is up, bro. Even my, even my captions [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=294.48s)]
*  are leaning right, dude. I'm on the right side of my camera. Captions are leaning right. I don't [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=301.28s)]
*  know what the hell's going on. Now currying favor with the new administration donating to the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  presidential library, the inauguration, making deals with family members, the Trump family. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=310.96s)]
*  How far are we from a kleptocracy? Well, let's start with oligarchy. And I think we are there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=315.44s)]
*  You know, when you see three of the richest people in this country, the three richest standing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=323.52s)]
*  behind the president when he gets inaugurated, when you see Elon Musk, who contributed over [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=330.64s)]
*  $200 million to 70 to get Trump elected and then becomes in many ways the most important appointee [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=338.0s)]
*  of the Trump administration. And when you see since Trump's inauguration, software, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=346.64s)]
*  dev computer guy, what the hell did you do to your computer? I've never seen this other 12 years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  I've never experienced this issue before. And I don't think a single chatter has ever experienced [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=357.04s)]
*  this issue before as well. All of it, what Musk is doing is illegal. The title is in italics. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=362.0s)]
*  Everything is in italics. I don't know what it is, but I don't really care. Whatever Elon must [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  becoming 150 billion Twitter richer in two and a half weeks, 150 billion dollars richer [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=377.36s)]
*  you tell me whether or not we are living in an oligarchy. And I think the function of government [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  under Trump, under Elon Musk will not be to serve ordinary people, but to make the very richest [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=394.0s)]
*  people in this country even richer. There are probably some people watching who think and think, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  oh, Elon Musk, smart guy. He's got these 19, 20 something year old tech wizards going into [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=409.04s)]
*  government and looking for waste and abuse. And what's wrong with that? What is wrong with what [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=416.48s)]
*  is going on? Nothing wrong with looking for waste and the kinds of bureaucracy that exists. I think [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=423.36s)]
*  we can do a whole lot to get rid of the waste, the fraud, the excessive bureaucracy that exists [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=431.12s)]
*  in government, especially by the way, in the defense department. You did the same interview, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=438.24s)]
*  you got the same amount of motion as Anderson Cooper, my goat. I did it for 30 minutes. Anderson [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  only gets Bernie for seven. What is wrong right now is one simple reality. What Musk is doing [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=447.52s)]
*  is illegal and unconstitutional. You cannot go into an agency like USAID and essentially fire [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=453.76s)]
*  everybody and get rid of that agency. You cannot do that. That's not, that's an agency that was [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=463.52s)]
*  created by Congress. They want to get rid of USAID. Fine. Come to the Congress, make your case. You [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=470.32s)]
*  can't do it unilaterally. You cannot withhold US funds that were appropriated for Medicaid, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=476.16s)]
*  for community health centers, for Head Start. You cannot put a freeze on that. That money was [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=484.32s)]
*  appropriated by the Congress. And as I hope every fourth grader in America knows, Congress holds [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=490.48s)]
*  the purse strings. And what I also worry about is not just the movement toward oligarchy, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=497.04s)]
*  but this growing trend. When you balling with Bernie, I'll figure it out soon. I hope the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=503.44s)]
*  American people are seeing clearly that we had the January 6th recorders, the people who were [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=508.48s)]
*  trying to in a sense overthrow an election, undermine democracy, contributed to the entering [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=516.24s)]
*  of 170 Capitol Hill police officers. They are pardoned. And then the FBI agents, hard to make [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=523.44s)]
*  the case, doing what they are told, they are now being investigated. What is the future of the FBI? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=532.8s)]
*  Is the criteria to be an FBI agent in the future, one who swears allegiance to Donald Trump or one [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=540.72s)]
*  who upholds the Constitution and the rule of law? And I'll tell you something else in terms of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=546.96s)]
*  authoritarianism. Anderson, and this is something that you and other people in the media should pay [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=552.24s)]
*  attention to. ABC paid a fine to Donald Trump, presumably for saying something that he didn't [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=556.64s)]
*  like. Metta, owned by Zuckerberg, paid a $25 million fine to Trump. Right now, Paramount that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=569.04s)]
*  owns CBS is contemplating reaching a settlement with Trump. He has sued the Des Moines Register. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=578.0s)]
*  The FCC is now investigating PBS and NPR. That is a movement toward authoritarianism [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=585.5999999999999s)]
*  when you go after and intimidate an independent media. So you add it all together. We're moving [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=594.9599999999999s)]
*  toward an oligarchy. We're moving toward authoritarianism. And in terms of the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=602.8s)]
*  kleptocracy, well, what can I say? Just before he got inaugurated, Trump and his wife issued coins. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  They made billions of dollars. Anybody can give to the president in a sense by buying those coins. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=614.64s)]
*  So the American people are going to stand up and fight back or else we're going to be in real [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=620.8s)]
*  trouble. We had a historian Doris Gerns Goodwin on last week who talked about Andrew Jackson [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=624.4s)]
*  corrupting essentially government employees, giving out favors to people who, Curry favored [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=629.12s)]
*  with him. He gave them civil service jobs and it took generations in America to correct that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=635.04s)]
*  And it took Teddy Roosevelt being the civil service commissioner for six years to really [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=642.96s)]
*  root that out and get a civil service that served the American people and not [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=648.4s)]
*  whoever was in power. The damage being done potentially, people think, oh, well, you know, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=653.92s)]
*  maybe it's just going to be four years. The damage can be done, can be for generations. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=660.56s)]
*  I mean, it goes without saying that I think the overwhelming majority of Americans want a strong, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=666.48s)]
*  efficient, independent civil service. We can make it. I am not here to tell you [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=671.04s)]
*  that we don't have a bureaucracy, that we don't have waste. We do. We got to work on that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=678.1600000000001s)]

*  people who are simply loyal to Donald Trump. That's not the way democracy is supposed to work. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=689.44s)]
*  Let me just quickly ask you on Gaza. When you heard the president of the United States [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=695.84s)]
*  talking about turning the Gaza Strip, I mean, getting two million Palestinians out, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, as anybody who has read history or the region or been watching for the last year, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=708.48s)]
*  did you think this was a joke at first? I mean, can you believe this? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=717.5200000000001s)]
*  Almost. Look, one could say that, Anderson, on the other hand, given the suffering that the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=720.24s)]
*  Palestinian people have gone through under Netanyahu's brutal war, which has killed at least [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=726.72s)]
*  45,000 injured, over 100,000 mostly women and children, the idea that the president of the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  United States is going to say to these people, oh, by the way, you're going to have to leave [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=742.64s)]
*  the place where you live because we are going to build something equivalent to the French Riviera. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=748.24s)]
*  Well, also the thugs of Hamas are still there. I mean, it's not as if they have gone. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=754.88s)]
*  Yeah, to say the least, but even the, that's right. So, you know, and you just discussed a [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  moment ago, how do you do that? Are American troops involved? How much money is being spent? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=765.52s)]
*  But the idea of telling 2.2 million people who live in an area, you're gone, we're going to build [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=770.0799999999999s)]

*  least, preposterous, it ain't going to happen. To the fallout from president Trump saying that [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=782.1600000000001s)]
*  the U S would. Every aspect of this admin is so fucked. It's just, I think it's Trump playing [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=786.5600000000001s)]
*  hardball as always. What Trump says and what Trump will do are two entirely separate things. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=792.72s)]
*  That doesn't stop the fact that he is actively normalizing and genuinely wants to do this, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=801.12s)]
*  by the way, like I make no mistake. I think Trump, if given the opportunity, would love to do this. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=808.72s)]
*  Will he be able to do it? I don't know. Not chat being pro Hamas crazy brother. It is not October [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=813.44s)]
*  seven any longer. I don't know what you are talking about here. Okay. Like if you can't [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=819.84s)]
*  comprehend why people would resist against the Israeli apartheid after 16 months of genocide, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=825.0400000000001s)]
*  as the American government that allowed Israel to do this by offering the munitions to do it, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=831.2s)]
*  while also simultaneously, while also simultaneously talking currently about the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=837.12s)]
*  fact that there will be mass ethnic cleansing, a mass population transfer scheme on this [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=842.96s)]
*  existing territory. Like, and you're still like, well, what about Hamas? You're out of your fucking [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  mind, dude. Get a new point, please. Hamas is but a name. Okay. That's it. That's all it is. It's an [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=853.36s)]
*  expression is an expression of Palestinian emancipation. That's it. That's what it is. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=860.0s)]
*  If it's, if it's no longer Hamas, it's something else. Okay. It's going to be something else. And [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  in the past, it was something different than Hamas. It was the PLO, something that I have [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=871.68s)]
*  maintained that was written about on Fox news as well was the fact that Hamas is the lesser of two [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=875.92s)]
*  evils between Hamas and Israel. It's just the truth. Yeah. I know I covered this earlier, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=883.92s)]
*  that Egyptian diplomats came out and said, Biden said the exact same thing. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=889.28s)]
*  Biden quietly made the exact same proposals that they refused to abide by in terms of mass ethnic [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=892.48s)]
*  transfer, which is the least shocking, which is the least shocking revelation of all time. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=899.44s)]
*  The major difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, at least on this issue is that [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=906.0s)]
*  Donald Trump says a quiet part out loud, but American foreign policy, as I've stated is [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=912.72s)]
*  uniparty. Yeah. Nine seven two magazines. New coverage also shows that [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=918.4s)]
*  after using bunker buster bombs, they gas the tunnels and most likely killed hostages in the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=923.92s)]
*  process. I remember one of the, one of the family members in Israel of one of the hostages that was [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=930.8s)]
*  killed was actually demanding an additional investigation, a third party investigation into [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=938.4s)]
*  how one of the hostages had died. And her suspicion, if I recall correctly, was that he was [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=943.52s)]
*  gassed. Now nine seven two magazines investigation show that there is a very high likelihood that [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=948.8s)]
*  that is what happened from one year ago. A hostage mother says toxic gas from Israeli bombs killed [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=953.76s)]
*  her son. Is she right? This is from January 31st, 2024 from an entire year ago. Take over Gaza. Our [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=959.04s)]
*  chief White House correspondent, Mary Bruce, tracking this for us also from the White House. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=970.0s)]
*  Mary, good morning. Good morning. Well, after the president declared that the U.S. would take over [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=973.68s)]
*  Gaza and that the Palestinian people would be permanently, why are you even making what [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=978.64s)]
*  comparison? What comparison did I make? I didn't make a comparison. I just told you what happened. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=982.88s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. You knew what you were insinuating. Are you talking [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=987.36s)]
*  about making a Holocaust comparison? If that's what you're thinking that I'm insinuating in this [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=991.68s)]
*  circumstance, I was not. Having said that, yes, I have volunteer voluntarily made comparisons to [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=996.16s)]
*  Israel and Nazi Germany numerous times over. You must be new here if you think I'm afraid of making [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1002.8s)]
*  such comparisons. Zionism is a fascist movement very similar in its expression of violence to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1008.0799999999999s)]
*  the Nazi movement. Okay, we're talking about Israel using chemical weapons and potentially gas [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1015.76s)]
*  on Israeli citizens that are hostages. That is just what is reported on in the news. It seems [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1023.12s)]
*  like you have issues with what Israel is doing. Or maybe you have issues when someone talks about [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1033.12s)]
*  what Israel is doing. If you consider what Israel is doing, which is genocide, to be very different [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1039.76s)]
*  than what the Nazi Germany did. I don't know what to tell you. They also did a genocide. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1046.88s)]
*  Just what the truth is. It's not that you have an issue with me. It's that you have an issue with [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1054.5600000000002s)]
*  the truth. That's it. You can say crazy about it all day every day, but it won't change the truth. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1061.2800000000002s)]
*  ...the White House this morning is struggling to explain what this plan would look like, how this [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1066.0s)]
*  actually works. Now this proposal has sparked international outrage and now some administration [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
*  officials are seeming to dial back the president's language. The president said bluntly that it was [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1076.9599999999998s)]
*  his intention to remove Palestinians from Gaza permanently, but here at the White House, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1081.84s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt now says the relocation would be temporary to allow Gaza to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1086.24s)]
*  rebuild, though the administration estimates that could take 10 to 15 years. She insisted the U.S. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1091.52s)]
*  would not be paying for that rebuilding. While the president initially said he was willing to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1096.72s)]
*  use the U.S. military if necessary, when I asked Levitt whether American troops would forcibly [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1101.36s)]
*  remove Palestinians or be fighting on the ground in Gaza, she said the president has not committed [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1106.08s)]
*  to troops in the region. And in fact, just now the president posting that quote, no soldiers by the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1111.28s)]
*  U.S. would be needed, saying stability for the region would reign. Now the White House was also [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1116.24s)]
*  pressed on the president's decades of criticism of U.S. entanglements and conflicts abroad, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1121.76s)]
*  but the White House says that the U.S. would not be entangled in the Middle East through this plan [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1126.32s)]
*  even though the president said quote the U.S. Yeah, it's just weird because we are already [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1131.28s)]
*  entangled in it because without our support, without our bombs and munitions, for example, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1137.6s)]
*  Israel wouldn't be able to destroy as many parts of Gaza as they have. So to say that we are not [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  entangled in this is ridiculous. Man falsely poses as an immigration agent and traps Latino men in a [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1149.12s)]
*  car. I hope he goes to jail. Doesn't Israel have their own arsenal though? Yes, it's simply not [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1154.24s)]
*  enough to maintain a permanent bombing campaign that reduces the entirety of the Gaza Strip to [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1160.88s)]
*  rubble. U.S. would own Gaza and would be responsible for dismantling all of the unexploded bombs and [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1165.7600000000002s)]
*  weapons there. So we're going to own Gaza even though we're not going to send any money, we're [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1171.1200000000001s)]
*  not going to send troops and all of the other nations said they're not prepared to take [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1174.8000000000002s)]
*  Palestinians. That is exactly where we stand right now. The president is making this sweeping [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1178.8000000000002s)]
*  outline calling for this plan without explaining how he is going to pull this. I'm not trying to [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1184.0s)]
*  call you all a promise, but I thought of this from a philosophical position. I feel both have [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1188.72s)]
*  merit. Do you feel in your position that it is more important to call out the tractor talking [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1193.76s)]
*  points and demonstrate how to dismantle them or to clarify positions for folks who are in the same [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1196.96s)]
*  headspace as you promote? It's both. I do both. Sometimes I do more of the latter, other times I [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1200.88s)]
*  do more of the former. It's important to do both. They are not committing to putting troops on the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1206.56s)]
*  ground, they are not committing to spending any money, and they still have not explained by what [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1211.3600000000001s)]
*  authority the president would be able to take over this sovereign territory. George. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1215.44s)]
*  Very Bruce. Thanks very much. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1218.96s)]
*  At the top of the program, we laid out the administration's rewriting of what the [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1221.04s)]
*  Yeah. The reason why I talked about the previous administration's actions earlier when talking [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1225.1200000000001s)]
*  about Gaza and how the Trump administration's actions are going to differ from like the previous [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1231.44s)]
*  one was because of this, because everyone in the United States of America always likes to revert [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1236.56s)]
*  the conversation back to an appropriate vector of anger, drama. Okay. For YouTube slop tubers [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1243.36s)]
*  that can be drama surrounding content creators. And for obviously liberals who have a vested [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1253.04s)]
*  interest in defending the failure of a candidate and a failure of a campaign that just took place [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1259.84s)]
*  that lost to Donald Trump the second time around, their goal is to obviously deflect blame away from [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1265.4399999999998s)]
*  the democratic parties ineptitude and away from the campaign specifically back to a target that [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1271.28s)]
*  everyone can get mad about. Now it can be the third party voters or the Bernie bros, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1277.6s)]
*  or in this circumstance, the radical Muslims in Dearborn. Okay. It is their fault that Kamala [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1282.3999999999999s)]
*  Harris lost very frustrating process considering that they did play a role in Kamala Harris's [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1289.44s)]
*  defeat, especially in Michigan, they played a very important role. But that issue is not up to the [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1298.32s)]
*  voters that that responsibility does not fall on the voters. Votes are not earned. We exist in a [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1305.9199999999998s)]
*  theoretical democracy where votes are supposed to be votes are not entitled for they're supposed to [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1312.24s)]
*  be earned. Sorry. Okay. That is the that's the foundational principle of a democratic administration, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1319.52s)]
*  a democratic form of governance is that your elected representatives are supposed to represent [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1327.44s)]
*  you. Okay. And in that process, voters are going to extract concessions. But for some reason, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1333.92s)]
*  people love blaming voters in general, and never the campaign. People also love blaming third party [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1341.3600000000001s)]
*  voters specifically, ironically enough, third party voters still could not make up for the margin [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1347.68s)]
*  of defeat in many of the states that Kamala Harris lost. So why do Democrats still make this point? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1352.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, because, again, there's a little bit of that the truth doesn't matter attitude on the liberal [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1361.44s)]
*  side of the spectrum as well. This is a very dangerous game to play. This is a major issue [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1367.28s)]
*  for me. The fact that on the right, we've just gone into full tilt denialism and, and desperately [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1373.68s)]

*  And liberals play a little bit of that as well on their end. Not good. Okay. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1390.8799999999999s)]
*  The president said last night about taking over Gaza and remaking it as a Riviera of the Middle [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1395.9199999999998s)]
*  East his words, regardless of what the people around him say he said he said it all on camera [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1400.0s)]
*  and millions of people saw it, including Arab Americans, many of whom voted for him. More from [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1404.8s)]
*  CNS Jason Carroll now in Dearborn, Michigan. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1409.04s)]
*  Days before the last presidential election, Donald Trump was the invited guest at the Great [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1414.96s)]
*  Commoner restaurant in Dearborn, Michigan. Alberta Boss says he extended that invitation, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1419.92s)]

*  Many in the community are a lot at a loss for words. Last night was a very rough night for most [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1432.8799999999999s)]
*  of us. A boss is Arab American and one of a number of Democrats who voted for Trump. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1438.08s)]
*  A boss says he hoped Trump would do more than president Joe Biden did to help Palestinians [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1443.6799999999998s)]
*  suffering in Gaza. The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip. But after Trump said Palestinians [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1449.76s)]
*  should leave Gaza so it can be redeveloped, a boss says not only does he feel betrayed, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1455.04s)]
*  he's hearing from a number of people angered over his past support of Trump. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1460.6399999999999s)]
*  What's so insane to me is that the Democratic Party saw a 112% swing in this constituency [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1466.3200000000002s)]
*  to a guy who set the stage for October 7 to happen and to a guy who ran on doing the Muslim ban. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1481.68s)]
*  Okay, think about how unimaginably bad you dropped that fucking ball. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1490.88s)]
*  Okay, we say Felford again award for many situations. This is one of the few instances [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1500.48s)]
*  where the Democrats basically pushed actively voters from this constituency directly to [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1508.8000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump. Yeah, Donald Trump lied. No shit. I repeated this over and over and over again [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1516.8s)]
*  throughout the campaign where I said Donald Trump got a hundred million dollars from Miriam Adelson. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1522.72s)]
*  One hundred million dollars. If you think that he is going to be good for the Palestinians, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1530.32s)]
*  you're wrong. As a matter of fact, the reason why he is going to be most likely worse for the [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1535.04s)]
*  Palestinians is because of their ambitions in the West Bank because American foreign policy is [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1541.12s)]
*  only uniparty, but it always tax further to the right when Republicans are in charge. So they [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1547.04s)]
*  increase the brutality. Okay. I mentioned this time and time again on numerous occasions, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1554.0s)]
*  but when one party is effectively controlling the pain and death and destruction as the [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1559.36s)]
*  administration in charge and actively undermining this constituency by basically saying we don't [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1571.92s)]
*  want you. We don't need you. We can win without you to prove a point. Okay. And the other party [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1578.48s)]
*  at least has that, I guess, audacity or the decency to lie. Yeah. The voters are going to [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1584.32s)]
*  understandably go with the party that's lying to them with the hopes that that party that's lying [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1590.8s)]
*  to them is maybe telling the truth. Okay. That's it. This to me is not only a, a clear indication [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1596.3999999999999s)]
*  of the, the moral ineptitude, the immorality of the democratic party, but it also is a major [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1606.08s)]
*  indication of the awful ways in which the Democrats campaign. If you lose to the Muslim [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1615.2s)]
*  bang guy, if you lose the Muslim vote to the Muslim bang guy, and you don't go back to the [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1622.88s)]
*  drawing board and go, how do we fuck up so hard? You want to lose? That's it. It's crazy. You will [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1627.52s)]
*  never understand the desperation that people have when they're seeing their family members be [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1633.84s)]
*  slaughtered on television, when they try to talk to them and they're being blown to bits by American [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1638.8s)]
*  bombs that they paid for with their taxes. That's just something you will never be able to comprehend [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1644.48s)]
*  by an administration that you voted for. That's another thing that you have to remember by an [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1650.08s)]
*  administration that you voted for. And because you can't comprehend that feeling, because you [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1655.1999999999998s)]
*  will never be able to understand it, you can be callous in this moment. That's it. Don't do this. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1660.16s)]
*  And I maintain this position as someone who also said that Donald Trump is most likely going to be [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1665.8400000000001s)]
*  worse than the administration prior. Even after the ceasefire negotiation was pushed for by Trump's [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1671.76s)]
*  envoy, Steve Witkoff, I maintain this position that they are most likely gearing up for permanent [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1677.76s)]
*  annexation of the West Bank. But you have to remember that you have to remember where this [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1683.12s)]
*  pain and where this hurt was coming from and who was responsible for it. The Democratic Party actively [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1691.12s)]
*  threw away the easiest gimme of all time. Kamala Harris actively ran towards Biden instead of [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1696.8799999999999s)]
*  running away from Biden, not on just Gaza. Gaza is one issue. It's a significant one, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1705.6s)]
*  but it's one issue. What is important about Gaza is that it demonstrates a couple things. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1711.84s)]
*  Okay. It is a microcosm of the problem at the heart of the Democratic Party, which is their [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1718.1599999999999s)]
*  inability to listen to the actual voters, no matter how hard, no matter how loud those voters are [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1724.8s)]
*  yelling, their inability to do the bidding of voters and doing everything they can to defend [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1730.0s)]
*  their benefactors, their corporate donors, their party boosters. Okay. This is it. They were willing [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1739.28s)]
*  and did throw away an election. They threw away an election when all signs and all data readily [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1748.08s)]
*  available showed that changing the trajectory and pushing for a ceasefire actively would most likely [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1755.6s)]
*  have seen at least a six point swing in some of the key States. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1764.72s)]
*  Democrats did nothing because Trump was worse and Trump won because Democrats did nothing. Yeah. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1769.2s)]
*  Respond to certain messaging. You mean how you don't respond to genuine critiques. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1774.8s)]
*  I hope the chatters can redirect us chatter to a video where I have addressed a million times over [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1780.4s)]
*  the same exact. We also didn't create a new category for Gaza response out of fear that [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1787.04s)]
*  that category would be leaked. Instead, we were told to mark them up as no response. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1791.44s)]
*  The organizer said faulting top Harris campaign leaders for failing to address the issue. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1795.1200000000001s)]
*  The only clowns out there are those who were in senior leadership and decided to abdicate on this [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1798.56s)]
*  issue who sounds the Palestinian speaker of the DNC who told us to ignore it. Every time a voter [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1802.48s)]
*  asked about asked us about Gaza. Like this is, this is a massive failure. Writing this off is [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1806.56s)]
*  throwing away tens of millions of dollars of work. Okay. Straight up. It's akin to [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1814.24s)]
*  lighting $10 million on fire. You understand when someone goes and knocks on a door and has a direct [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1822.64s)]
*  back and forth or someone calls someone a voter, a potential voter and has this back and forth and [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1829.2s)]
*  they mark that as like, oh, unresponsive throw it away. You're literally throwing data away [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1834.08s)]
*  and you're doing that because you're afraid that if that data leaks, everyone will know the sinister [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1839.6s)]
*  truth that you are avoiding this issue like the plague because you have donors up your asshole. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1844.7199999999998s)]
*  Okay. That was the one aspect of the conversation that I had leading up to the election with the [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1852.0s)]
*  pod. John's where John Favreau basically told me in Michigan that they're getting a lot of calls [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1857.4399999999998s)]
*  from Jewish voters who are worried about Israel's, you know, who are worried about the democratic [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1863.76s)]
*  party dropping Israel and, and, uh, defending Palestinians. I don't think that was real. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1869.12s)]
*  I think he felt like he was pushed into a corner cause I had actual data and he just kind of said [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1874.1599999999999s)]
*  that I maintain the position. Look, I have no, I have, you know, no love loss between me and the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1878.9599999999998s)]
*  pod John's, but I think he basically came up with that on the spot. Okay. When we were having that [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1886.0s)]
*  conversation because there is not a single piece of evidence that I've seen. And by the way, in the [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1890.1599999999999s)]
*  aftermath of the election, this demonstrably was a failure regardless, but there's not a single [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1895.2s)]
*  piece of evidence that I've seen so far, including directly, uh, directly polling American Jews and [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1899.52s)]
*  their opinion on Israel that said that Israel was the primary issue for them. The only people that [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1906.96s)]
*  Israel is a primary issue for are people that are already voting for the Republican party. They voted [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1914.16s)]
*  for the Republican party and they're going to continue voting for the Republican party. That's [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1918.0800000000002s)]
*  it. She's socked. Are you saying that people who didn't vote were right? It's a two party system. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1921.76s)]
*  No, I'm saying that people don't vote on harm reduction narratives. This has been a demonstrable [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1926.48s)]
*  failure now twice around. Okay. At a certain point, you can't hope that the educated electorate is [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1934.8s)]
*  going to come out and respond to harm reduction narratives. That is not a way to launch successful [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1942.56s)]
*  campaigns. It has not worked. Ironically enough, in this circumstance, it's not like Kamala Harris [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1948.64s)]
*  was even advocating for harm reduction on other aspects, maybe, but the harm reduction was [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1953.5200000000002s)]
*  packaged in a way where the Democrats were admitting that they were wrong and hypocritical. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1960.24s)]
*  Like on the issue of the border, Democrats were advocating for a right wing border bill [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1965.1200000000001s)]
*  that Republicans wrote that was basically Trump's agenda from 2020 that they successfully defeated [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1971.0400000000002s)]
*  on the issue of immigration. That basically was an admission that they were wrong on immigration. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1976.64s)]
*  Why the fuck would anybody vote for you then? On the other hand, Trump wants to do mass deportations. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1981.76s)]
*  Is that worse? Of course it is. Trump wanted to do mass deportations. Kamala Harris advocated for [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1987.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's policy from 2020, which is worse. Of course mass deportation is worse, but in the [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1993.68s)]
*  eyes of the voters, they're not going to look at that and go, well, this is harm reduction. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=1999.1200000000001s)]
*  They're going to look at that and go, you said the border wall was racist for eight years. You [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2002.5600000000002s)]
*  called me a Nazi. Now you want to build the border wall? Turns out your fucking ineptitude [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2006.08s)]
*  is the reason why we have a border crisis to begin with. And now you're admitting that. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2011.28s)]
*  Do you understand? That's it. You can't win elections like this. So I don't know why [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2014.32s)]
*  there are chatters in here. Okay. I don't understand why there are chatters in here [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2019.84s)]
*  who unironically don't say admitting it's not true. I know, but it looks like they're [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2028.0s)]
*  admitting to fault. That's the point. I don't think it's correct, but it doesn't matter. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2032.96s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the truth is. We're talking about how people vote. We're talking [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2037.3600000000001s)]
*  about how people respond to certain messaging. Do you understand? And look, there are plenty [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2041.6000000000001s)]
*  in this community, Michael from Pennsylvania, myself, we saw this from a mile away. I talked [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2048.2400000000002s)]
*  about how dangerous a gamble this was for Kamala Harris running around with Liz Cheney over and [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2052.0s)]
*  over again, thinking that she's going to be able to carve out a constituency of white suburban moms [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2056.8s)]
*  that are going to carry her to the electoral victory. It was a failure. She drove away the [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2061.44s)]
*  base. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMH1bmoEveI&t=2066.56s)]
