# Ashley Saint Clair Calls Out Elon On X | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg)
*  And it's not because of Elon Musk. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, you see, it's on. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=1.72s)]
*  They have to weigh their family values against how much they hate women. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=2.6s)]
*  Yeah, ironically enough. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=5.12s)]
*  I think Laura Loomer is just jealous that Elon has not put his inside of. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Now let's get to Elon Musk baby mama drama. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=16.4s)]
*  Here is Ashley St. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=19.76s)]
*  Claire, Elon Musk's fourth baby mama selling her Tesla. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=20.84s)]
*  I need to make up with a 60% cut that Elon made to our child's our son's child support. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think this is look, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=30.96s)]
*  Ashley St. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=32.72s)]
*  Claire is a Twitter troll and an Elon Musk reply guy that Elon Musk famously, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=33.56s)]
*  and there is a foolishly decided to put his inside of. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=42.68s)]
*  And now she's making the most of it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=43.44s)]
*  Make up for the 60% cut that Elon made to our son's child support. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=45.6s)]
*  Why do you think that he did that? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  Do you feel like he was sort of like vindictive against you in some way? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=55.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's his known as operandic when women speak out. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=59.92s)]
*  When was the last time that you used Vulture in the tragedy claim? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=64.68s)]
*  February 13th. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=68.52s)]
*  That he's just not responding to at all? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=71.28s)]
*  How would you characterize him in the way he is without a mask? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=74.0s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=78.48s)]
*  So I'm going to say to you, I'm not going to get past this one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=79.48s)]
*  You can check the stocks. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=82.36s)]
*  I am not the only one. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=84.52s)]
*  Who told you to do that? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=87.56s)]
*  We're not going to get you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=89.36s)]
*  Can you explain the child why you chose the phrasing put his inside of? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=91.84s)]
*  Because it's artificial insemination is not or is it in vitro fertilization? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=95.64s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=101.0s)]
*  Like he didn't he didn't piper anyway. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=104.56s)]
*  So here's what took place after Laura Loomer says gold digger and professional gaslighters [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=108.36s)]
*  St. Claire Ashley was caught on camera. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=118.16s)]
*  Outside of a ritzy Manhattan condo paid for by her sugar daddy, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=126.08s)]
*  Elon Musk selling one her one hundred thousand dollar Tesla, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=129.68s)]
*  she said was gifted her by Elon Musk during the romantic relationship to which Elon Musk [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=134.48s)]
*  responded with. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=139.56s)]
*  I don't know if the child is mine or not, but I am not against finding out no court [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=141.28s)]
*  order is needed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=145.56s)]
*  Despite not knowing for sure. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=148.32s)]
*  I've given Ashley a two point two point five melon and I'm sending her five hundred car [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=149.76s)]
*  a year to which she replied with Elon. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  We asked you to confirm paternity through a test before our child who you named was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=159.64s)]
*  even born. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=163.92s)]
*  You refused and you weren't sending me money. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=165.04s)]
*  You were sending support for your child that you thought was necessary until you withdrew [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=167.92s)]
*  most of it to maintain control and punish me for disobedience. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  But you're really only punishing your son. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=176.88s)]
*  It's ironic that your last effort in court was to try to gag me while you use a social [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  media channel you literally own to distribute derogatory messages about me and our child [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  to the entire world. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=189.32s)]
*  It is all about control with you and everyone can see it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=190.76s)]
*  America needs you to grow up you petulant man child. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  Makes me happy how awful she is so I don't have to feel even a little bit bad about any [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=198.16s)]
*  of this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=201.55999999999997s)]
*  Get his ass Ashley. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=202.55999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=203.55999999999997s)]
*  Laura Loomer apparently replied to this and said Ashley you don't need three million dollars [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=204.55999999999997s)]
*  to raise a baby. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=209.27999999999997s)]
*  This is so outrageous that you had stopped birth control. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=210.72s)]
*  You seem to have plotted for many years on how to get Elon Musk to knock you up and now [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=212.92s)]
*  you're complaining because you want more money for a baby. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  Not to mention you were making over twenty five grand a month on ex payouts. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=220.32s)]
*  How does one person need that much money to survive. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  This is an insult to everyone St. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=226.48s)]
*  Clair Ashley. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=227.68s)]
*  You are trying to cash out on a billionaire who you baby trapped the party of conservative [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  values the party of family values ladies and gentlemen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=235.16s)]
*  There it is. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=239.24s)]
*  There it is. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=240.24s)]
*  Once again it seems to me like the conservative movement is not necessarily all too interested [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=242.12s)]
*  in maintaining or abiding by any semblance of humanity nor party values whatsoever. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=250.32s)]
*  They're being messy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=256.36s)]
*  If you will they're being messy on Maine they're being messy on the timeline. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=259.6s)]
*  Anyway I know Ashley wants to come on the broadcast. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=263.68s)]
*  I have entertained the notion. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=265.84s)]
*  I don't know if I should or not. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=267.76s)]
*  So stop asking me chatters and it's not because of Elon Musk. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  Well you see us on they have to weigh their family values against how much they hate women. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=275.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=278.28s)]
*  I think Laura Loomer is just jealous that Elon has not put his inside of her. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=279.67999999999995s)]
*  But I digress. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  Bring her on hold the baby. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=287.11999999999995s)]
*  OK you're crazy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  When is Ashley says she wants to be on the broadcast through back channel communications. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  Not directly. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  That's the baby mama drama. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=296.84s)]
*  But that's not the only fissure amongst the modern conservative movement. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  I must let you in on a new secret that I found that is not a secret at all but in broad daylight [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=304.0s)]
*  there is a new meta amongst the conservative movement especially on the independent media [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  side of things. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  As you guys all know there's a couple different dramas taking place in the right wing in fighting [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=317.52s)]
*  which is albeit a rare treat but a treat nonetheless. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFpWBtj6gg&t=324.84s)]
