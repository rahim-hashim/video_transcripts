# Trump Cut Out Israel To Deal With Hamas | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk)
*  Well, it turns out Trump is done. It turns out that Trump is frustrated and cutting side [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=0.0s)]
*  deals with Hamas again. And the culmination of that side deal has unfolded in the release [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=7.44s)]
*  of Edon Alexander, the New Jersey resident dual citizen in the lead up to this actual [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=12.98s)]
*  negotiation with Hamas that Israel took no part. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=21.98s)]
*  All right. Now let's get to the news. There is a special report Hamas has released American [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=26.82s)]
*  hostage Edon Alexander. Donald Trump actually did something unique here. And after, after [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=36.5s)]
*  cutting talks with Israel and going directly to Hamas in the past, they did it again. Donald [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=44.34s)]
*  Trump, Donald Trump and his team actually said Israel, you are a major setback in these ceasefire [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  negotiations. So you were going directly to Hamas and they did that just like they directly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  went to the onslaught a lot movement to cut a side deal and a ceasefire with the onslaught [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=66.66s)]
*  a lot movement. If you recall, if you are fans of drop site news as I am, and there is a lot [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=73.3s)]
*  being able to talk to who these directly and being able to talk to Hamas directly, being able [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=80.5s)]
*  to talk to his bull and Palestinian Islamic jihad directly. So shouts out to the dropsite boys [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=85.3s)]
*  for constantly doing incredible coverage on that front. If you remember their reporting on the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=89.54s)]
*  matter, the onslaught a lot movement told drop site news in an interview that they would stop [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=94.5s)]
*  blowing up American ships and attacking American naval vessels if America stopped bombing Yemen. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=103.14s)]
*  Okay. This reporting was so important that I think personally, I'm speculating here, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=111.53999999999999s)]
*  it played a role in the American government actually seeing that and going, okay, we can [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=121.46s)]
*  cut a side deal with them because they literally ended up doing that. And the side deal that they [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=127.62s)]
*  cut in Oman was on the same boundaries that were presented in the drop site reporting a month prior [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=133.62s)]
*  that they would not stop the blockade. They would not stop attacking Israel as long as Israel kept [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=139.54s)]
*  doing its genocide, but they would stop attacking American vessels, American Navy ships in the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=145.62s)]
*  region. If America stopped attacking Yemen, if America stopped bombing Yemen, and they did that, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=150.58s)]
*  they cut a side deal with the onslaught a lot movement. And then Trump famously came out and said, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=157.14s)]
*  who these are so brave. They're so courageous. They're so strong. I love them. Right. And then [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=162.26s)]
*  after, and then after that, a similar pattern is emerging with Israel. Okay. A similar pattern is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  now emerging with Israel where the Trump administration, if you recall, had actually [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  sidestepped Israel a couple months prior. They had another guy, I forget his name. What was the guy [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=180.33999999999997s)]
*  that talked directly to Hamas and Israel got him cut out? I forget his name. He was like a Trump [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=186.42s)]
*  envoy that, that basically went directly to Hamas and had a conversation directly with Hamas. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=193.86s)]
*  And no, it wasn't Witkoff chatters. Come on. It was the different guy, not Witkoff, the Adam Baylor. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=200.18s)]
*  Thank you, Muslim monk. Thank you. Adam Baylor. Adam Baylor was the one who famously talked to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=207.7s)]
*  Hamas and then went on, went to American news and straight up was like, Hey, these guys are not [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=214.74s)]
*  animals. Like they're human beings. We can talk to them. And Israel lost their minds because the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=223.94s)]
*  Trump administration a couple months ago, if you remember, was using this one guy, Adam Baylor, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=230.82000000000002s)]
*  to directly talk to Hamas to release, uh, Eidon Alexander, Elon Alexander, who is a New Jersey [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=236.5s)]
*  resident with a dual citizenship. He's an Israeli American who was captured on October 7th. Okay. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=243.7s)]
*  He was a soldier. He's a prisoner of war. He was a part of the IDF and he got captured and the Trump [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  administration wanted to cut a side deal with Hamas to release him month. Okay. And Adam Baylor [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  even went as far as to say, we're not, we're the United States. We're not an agent of Israel, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=265.46s)]
*  right? And this frustrated the Israeli authorities so much that they basically [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=268.98s)]
*  back pocketed him. They cut him out. They were like, how dare you do this? How dare you communicate [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  with the mosque without our go ahead? How dare you communicate with the mosque without us? Well, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=279.06s)]
*  it turns out Trump is done. It turns out that Trump is frustrated and, uh, and, and cutting [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  side deals with Hamas again. And the culmination of that side deal has unfolded in the release of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=290.42s)]
*  Alexander, the New Jersey resident, dual citizen, uh, in the, in the, uh, lead up to this actual [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=297.06s)]
*  negotiation with Hamas that Israel took no part in, by the way, Steve Wittkopf openly said, and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=305.22s)]
*  wanted to leak to the press, these statements, this is important. He wanted these statements to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=311.22s)]
*  be heard by press. See what cost says the U S wants to return the hostages, but Israel is not [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=315.86s)]
*  ready to end the war. Israel is prolonging the war, even though we do not see where further [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=321.46s)]
*  progress can be made. The Trump administration knows very well that Israel's making this war [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=325.62s)]
*  last forever in order to keep Netanyahu in power and continue to Israel has lost Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=329.54s)]
*  Now, I don't think Israel has lost Trump entirely. I think that who knows what might happen. Miriam [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=332.9s)]
*  Adelson might actually make a phone call to Trump and be like, cut it out. What are you doing? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=341.3s)]
*  You know, I gave you so much money. You have having said that Trump is one, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=347.85999999999996s)]
*  hard to work with and gets frustrated fast when he feels like he's being manipulated. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=356.17999999999995s)]
*  And obviously that, uh, that classic Israeli arrogance and entitlement is, you know, he's only [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=361.05999999999995s)]
*  going to take so much of that until he goes, shut the up. Okay. You're up the bag for me. He came [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=367.78s)]
*  into office saying he was going to end these wars. He's not getting the, the, um, he's not getting [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=373.22s)]
*  the, the response from Ukraine and Russia because Russia is a foreign adversary that is also [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=379.54s)]
*  manipulating Trump, but he can, he has a lot more power and a lot more motion over Israel, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=385.14000000000004s)]
*  which would not be able to conduct these operations without America's go ahead without [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=390.58000000000004s)]
*  America's munitions. So I think he looks at the situation. He looks at all the chaos unfolding [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=393.78000000000003s)]
*  around the planet and he goes, well, this is an area where I can actually put my weight down. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=399.14000000000004s)]
*  I can actually put my foot down. And in the process, I think the Netanyahu administration [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=402.98s)]
*  annoyed him so much that he was just like, okay, we're going to do it ourselves then. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=408.26s)]
*  And I think this was a big deal. This was a very big deal because it once again showed how much [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=412.42s)]
*  power America has because guess what? When America says we're extract, we're talking to Hamas directly [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=417.70000000000005s)]
*  and we're extracting an Israeli American and, uh, there are certain concessions that are going to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=423.22s)]
*  take place in the process. Israel has to entertain that is no, you can't do that as opposed to when [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=429.22s)]
*  France would try to do some shit like that. Israel could tell them to off, whereas they can't do that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=435.46000000000004s)]
*  to the United States of America. And Biden had that power to never forget that. That's why I was [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=440.1s)]
*  so goddamn frustrated with this administration, with the Biden administration lying at the behest [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=445.86s)]
*  of Israel, making it seem as though Biden was like having a stern talking to with Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=450.74s)]
*  and that Netanyahu was not playing ball. Yeah, Netanyahu doesn't have to play ball. You can take [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=456.02s)]
*  the ball away. You are the United States of America. So ironically enough, they basically lost one of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=460.82s)]
*  their biggest allies in the region. The Israeli government did because you had a brain dead, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=467.14s)]
*  diehard Zionist who was indoctrinated into this process and, and was, was actually a loyal servant [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=472.58s)]
*  at that point. Like he, he just like truly was a fedayeen for Israel in, in a way that Trump is not [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=481.46s)]
*  because Trump at the end of the day is easily manipulated. Trump at the end of the day is [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  hotheaded and will get mad. Trump at the end of the day will turn around and, and get a plane from [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=492.9s)]
*  Qatar and go, all right, well, I'll make nice with these boys. Right. Just like Trump and his, uh, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  seeming loyalty to Israel comes from the, the pocket change that he got to the tune of a hundred [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=507.06s)]
*  million dollars previously from Sheldon Adelson, who is now dead rest in piss. And now his wife, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=513.14s)]
*  Miriam Adelson, who gave another hundred million dollars this time around. So a hundred million [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=520.1s)]
*  dollars can buy a lot of influence in this administration, but that means that someone [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=525.22s)]
*  else with 150 million dollars could also buy a lot of influence in the administration. Right. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=530.98s)]
*  So, um, I think this is important. Uh, I think it's important that this deal happen because it [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=537.3s)]
*  basically shows the, the depravity of the Israeli government. It shows the depravity of the Israeli [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=542.9s)]
*  government to the Israeli society as a whole. It shows, uh, it shows Israelis that, uh, wanted to, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=548.7399999999999s)]
*  you know, release these hostages because they want their family members back that like this [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=555.78s)]
*  administration has no interest in this whatsoever. So this basically lights a fire under the asses of, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=559.9399999999999s)]
*  of everybody that is involved in this process to be like, what the is Netanyahu doing? This war [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=565.78s)]
*  cannot go on. Um, and that they're too invested in death and destruction and not invested in like [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=571.22s)]
*  actually bringing back hostages when America can seemingly do so. And in the process, the, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=576.74s)]
*  the Israeli government has said, we need to detox from American security arrangements. No, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=582.8199999999999s)]
*  the he won't. Right. Here's senior fellow, uh, of, uh, Carnegie endowment, Aaron David Miller, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=586.98s)]
*  who had this assessment and I kind of agree with it. A pattern is developing here. Trump outreach [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=593.3s)]
*  to Hamas twice, Houthi ceasefire and Iran negotiations, all uncoordinated with Israel, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=597.3s)]
*  with the possible exception of Bush Baker, all previous Republican Democrat administrations [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=601.6999999999999s)]
*  coordinated closely with Israel, no daylight policy, not this one fascinating. Now I don't know. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=605.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm still very skeptical about this process. I will say personally that it's not a, it's not a no [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=611.14s)]
*  daylight process. Maybe I'm too suspicious of Israel and how much power Israel has had in [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=617.06s)]
*  American foreign policy in the middle East in the past that like one man like Donald Trump is not [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=622.9799999999999s)]
*  going to be able to completely roll that back. But at the very least the Trump administration [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=627.78s)]
*  is seemingly not shying away from demonstrating a from Israel on a lot of these issues. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=635.6199999999999s)]
*  Okay. Do you see what I'm saying? The least NBC news can now confirm the last living American [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=642.7399999999999s)]
*  hostage being held in Gaza has been released. Don Alexander now in red cross custody after nearly [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=648.5799999999999s)]
*  600 days in captivity and heading home. He's 21 years old. He was born and raised. How does [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=655.54s)]
*  this administration's collaboration with Hamas converge with the administration's contemporary [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=661.54s)]
*  pro-Palestine protesters? Brother, they're not like pro-Hamas, but I do think that Israel is such [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=665.86s)]
*  a fucking arrogant and such an entitled ally that yes, it even gets these people to see Hamas as the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=672.82s)]
*  more reasonable, more restrained party because of Israel's behavior. Do you not understand? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=680.82s)]
*  They're not pro-Hamas, but even they understand like, yeah, we're going to probably get a better [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=687.94s)]
*  deal from Hamas than we will from Israel because they just want to fucking ethnically cleanse the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=694.18s)]

*  Hamas as the reasonable party. Remember, this is a guy that literally said he wanted to ethnically [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=793.38s)]
*  cleanse the Gaza Strip. Like that was his idea. Okay. That was his brilliant idea was like, yeah, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=799.86s)]
*  let's just fucking cleanse it all. And a couple of months later, now he's like, I'm done. I'm done. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=806.1s)]

*  Yeah. Straight up. What made Donald Trump such a loyal ally to Israel, which was how endlessly [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=897.06s)]
*  bribeable he is has also made him somewhat of a foe at times. Okay. But once again, don't forget, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=904.42s)]
*  I do believe personally, I do believe personally that Trump is unstable. He's dangerous. He does [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=912.5799999999999s)]

*  bones. Let's go baby. As I was saying, does this change so far? Both yes and no. Once again, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1018.74s)]
*  we don't know where this will go. I do not know what Trump will do. Okay. I do not know [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1026.98s)]
*  what Trump will do. And I'm very, very skeptical about like Trump caring about the well-wishes, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1032.98s)]
*  well-being of he is getting hard in the corner with all the possible out of context clips. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1038.74s)]
*  You can get, yeah, whatever. Who cares? I don't think he understands that if the, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1043.6200000000001s)]
*  if the motherfucking Trump administration arrests me, like that's not going to magically make people [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1048.82s)]
*  like him. That's going to make people despise them even further. Okay. Like that's cats out of the [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1055.06s)]
*  bag on that one. You know, there's no, there's no recovery there, but yeah, I don't give a fuck. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1062.18s)]
*  Who does it just end the genocide? Exactly. That's, that's how I feel about it. That's where [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1066.82s)]
*  I'm at on this. The Hamas statement shows how different Witkoff has been compared to the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1070.98s)]
*  Israelis. Yeah. We'll talk about that in a second. While Biden earned, Matthew petty says, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1074.58s)]
*  Biden was incredibly effective at his actual goal, buying Netanyahu infinite time for the war, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1079.9399999999998s)]
*  but that required Biden to pretend to be hapless. Matt dust, by the way, is executive vice president [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1083.3799999999999s)]
*  at CI policy. And he is Bernie's a former foreign policy advisor for Bernie Sanders and [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1089.06s)]
*  center for international policies is policy is like a, is like a anti Warhawk think tank basically. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1096.42s)]
*  And they do pretty good work. So Matt does says it's really something to watch Trump handle [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1102.66s)]
*  Netanyahu more effectively than the alleged foreign policy expert Joe Biden did. And this is true. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1108.26s)]
*  So far he's been able to implement a ceasefire. And also on top of that, also on top of that, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1113.62s)]
*  he's been able to, he's been able to basically cut a side deal and piss off the, the Israeli [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1120.42s)]
*  administrators in the process and is, is not afraid of stepping on toes in that regard. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1126.42s)]
*  And I think that's ultimately a good thing. Okay. Jeremy scale talked about how Trump's [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1134.42s)]
*  actions are being interpreted inside of Israel. We'll talk about that in a second, but first and [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1140.18s)]
*  foremost, let's get to does this fine. As long as it's not about Russia slash China law. Yeah. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1144.42s)]
*  I don't know his takes on China, but in any case, this is from the is a din al-Qassam brigades [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1151.7s)]
*  released and released a captured Israeli soldier, Eden Alexander, a U S citizen a short while ago [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1157.38s)]
*  following context of the U S administration. This comes to the part of the efforts being made by [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1162.02s)]
*  mediators to achieve a ceasefire, open the crossings and allow aid and relief to reach [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1165.94s)]
*  our people in the Gaza strip. The reason why Hamas did this was because they wanted to do a show of [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1170.02s)]
*  good faith to the Trump administration, because the Trump administration was willing and able to [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1177.06s)]
*  talk to them separately from Israel. This is the reason why they did this. So if you're asking, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1182.3400000000001s)]
*  like, what was the purpose of this? Like they, Israel is still not allowing aid in Israel's [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1187.54s)]
*  not allowing this. Israel's not doing anything. And Israel has said over and over again that we're [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1192.1000000000001s)]
*  not going to fuck in. We're not going to change course here. We are in the business of ethnically [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1196.18s)]
*  cleansing the Gaza strip. They have openly said it at this point, time and time again, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1200.3400000000001s)]
*  you don't have to read the tea leaves. Okay. You could just listen to Benjamin and Yahoo, who says [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1204.5800000000002s)]
*  we do not give a fuck about the hostages. Hostages are low priority. The highest priority is cleansing [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1208.66s)]
*  the strip, making it unlivable. Okay. Understand this everything that we have said, everything that [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1214.1000000000001s)]
*  I have said for the past 15, 16 months, these guys are now openly stating Israeli prime minister, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1221.7s)]
*  Netanyahu at the Knesset foreign affairs and security committee, the Gazans we remove will [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1228.1000000000001s)]
*  not return. They won't be there. We will control the place. There is no other war target. Any other [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1232.82s)]
*  target is just bluff. He has openly stated this. Okay. His only goal is to ethnically cleanse the [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1238.26s)]
*  fucking Gaza strip. They are saying it actively. They're saying it openly. They're saying it in [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1247.54s)]
*  real time. It is no longer something that you can, you can act like it's not happening. Of course, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1252.6599999999999s)]
*  there's very little coverage in the Western world on this stuff, but you know, they have moved on to [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1259.22s)]
*  at least this kind of thing. New York times doing six deadly minutes. I was really so just 15 rescue [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1264.58s)]
*  workers in Gaza. Like there is a tide shift in mainstream media as well. There's a tide shift [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1269.94s)]
*  in the state department, the way that they're examining their relationship with Israel. And [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1275.38s)]
*  they're companying that with mainstream press because the New York times is the number one [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1278.18s)]
*  Hasbro operation that has legitimacy. Right. And the reason their visual investigations team [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1281.5400000000002s)]
*  has always been fantastic. Shouts out to Eric Toler, shouts out to all the people that work in [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1288.42s)]
*  visual investigations in the forensic department and both Washington post and also a New York [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1293.0600000000002s)]

*  but their regular news reporting team on the Israel side has always been incredibly limited [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1303.38s)]
*  and always engaged in defending Israel, burying the lead, omitting key details, never really covering [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1309.14s)]
*  incredibly important things that are happening in Israel, like the rape riots or any number of [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1316.0200000000002s)]
*  different things. Like the other day, there was new CCTV footage that came out of concentration [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1320.74s)]
*  camp guards, literally raping a Palestinian in front of in front of cameras. That didn't get any [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1324.5800000000002s)]
*  sort of fucking, that didn't get any sort of coverage from the Western press, but this kind [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1331.14s)]

*  let's get to the news reporting on American hostage, Eden Alexander being released. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1361.46s)]
*  And Jersey, he also holds Israeli citizenship and was serving in the Israeli army when he was [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1365.78s)]

*  fucking, they talk about this guy, like, listen, I'm sorry. They talk about this guy as though [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1376.1799999999998s)]
*  he is like a hostage that was just minding his own fucking business. Like brother, he is a [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1384.9s)]
*  volunteer war criminal. Okay. He is a soldier in the Israeli occupying force. I'm sorry. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1392.1000000000001s)]
*  That's not the same as like taking a hostage from a fucking kibbutz. Okay. He was abducted from a [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1399.14s)]
*  tank. The fucking, the very fact, what, no, no, no, this isn't, this isn't, I don't think the guy, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1406.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't think Eden was abducted from a tank. I think he was, was he actually, was this the guy [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1412.74s)]
*  that got abducted from a tank? I thought that there was another guy that they said was abducted from [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1417.54s)]
*  a tank, by the way, kidnapped from a tank is an insane statement. Okay. But no, I thought he was [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1421.54s)]
*  like at the, I thought he was a, as a gate guard or something. This is a, this is a prisoner of war. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1426.82s)]
*  Okay. This is a prisoner of war. The framing, I don't think he was actually, I don't think he [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1433.06s)]
*  was actually taken out of the tank yet. Matan Angus was the tank guy. This guy hostage, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1439.22s)]
*  Matan Angus decided in April to release the video of his abduction from his tank. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1445.54s)]
*  You cannot be abducted from a fucking tank, dude. You're in a goddamn tank. You can't use the term [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1449.3s)]
*  abduction when talking about a dude in a fucking tank. Okay. That's not a kidnapping. That is a [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1455.22s)]
*  prisoner of war. Okay. That is a legal prisoner of war. You're fucking insane, but this is not [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1461.86s)]
*  that guy. This is a different guy. He was also, he was also a volunteer. Okay. He grew up in New [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1470.26s)]
*  Jersey and volunteer to join the Israel defense force out of high school and was reportedly [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1476.02s)]
*  serving near the Gaza border during the attack. Yes. He was, he was a prisoner of war. He was [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1479.2199999999998s)]
*  captured from a concrete outpost near the Gaza wall. Exactly. So the idea that this guy was, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1486.6599999999999s)]
*  was, you know, poor, poor guy, civilian fucking these, these Hamas rapists, like [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1493.06s)]
*  barbarically kidnapped them is fucking ridiculous. Words mean things. You know what I mean? Hamas [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1499.9399999999998s)]

*  not kidnapped. You are a prisoner of war in that process. If we can't consider Israeli occupying [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1564.2600000000002s)]

*  And Martin Scorsese posted with them, which made me really happy, but that's totally separate. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1584.26s)]
*  Let's see. First of all, on your win, I'm very sorry for everything you and your family continue [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1589.14s)]
*  to go through. Your win is not without controversy, obviously. And in particular, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1594.66s)]
*  some comments you've made in the past about the Israeli hostages have been very controversial, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1600.5s)]
*  where you have said that most of the hostages... Like, can you... Dude, dude, imagine having a [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1605.22s)]
*  Holocaust survivor on a media broadcast to be like, hey, you said something really mean about SS [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1611.7s)]
*  troopers. And the mean thing is basically that it is totally valid to fucking apprehend them [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1621.62s)]
*  and to stop them from doing murder, right? Like, can you imagine? What the fuck? After this person [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1630.4199999999998s)]
*  wins a Pulitzer for their dispatch as being a survivor of a live stream genocide, it's fucking [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1641.3s)]
*  insane. ...held by Hamas are not actually hostages. I believe you specifically singled out Emily [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1648.98s)]
*  Demare, who... Yes, Amy Cesar is correct. What Europe Couldn't Forgive Hitler wasn't what he did, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1655.6200000000001s)]
*  it was what he did to the white man is unironically so prescient in this moment to think about. A 28 [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1660.66s)]
*  year old who was kidnapped from her home and held for 471 days and lost two fingers. I'm just [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1666.26s)]
*  wondering, is there anything you want to clarify about those comments? First of all, I did not [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1673.7s)]
*  question her status as a hostage because she's a hostage, but because what other Palestinians who [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1680.3400000000001s)]
*  were kidnapped... I mean, I don't want to name people, but I have people in my family who were [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1688.26s)]
*  kidnapped from checkpoints, from schools, from shelters, and they are named prisoners. So my [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1692.42s)]
*  question was why should Emily and other hostages be named hostages while my loved ones should be [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1698.58s)]
*  named prisoners? So that was the question. I've never denied anyone suffering. I know that everyone [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1705.46s)]
*  is suffering, Israelis and Palestinians, but why are our sufferings not acknowledged? Why are we [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1710.1799999999998s)]
*  called terrorists? Why are we called prisoners of war? While the Israelis who were kidnapped from [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1716.02s)]
*  Israel are named hostage, does this give them more humanity because they are Israelis while my loved [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1720.82s)]
*  ones are being named prisoners and they are tortured? I mean, I myself, by the way, I was [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1725.7s)]
*  kept hostage for 53 hours. I was blindfolded and handcuffed and was beaten in my face and asked for [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1733.14s)]
*  them, for the Israeli soldiers, to see a doctor and they denied me any medical treatment. So no one is [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1739.46s)]
*  talking about this. Why? They are not acknowledging my suffering. So I have this privilege of being [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1744.3400000000001s)]
*  called the hostage while I am called in all the social and all news platforms. I was named, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1749.46s)]
*  I was detained. I was a prisoner. Why am I less human? Misinformation that Trump, Allah awaken the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1755.38s)]
*  people was an edit is misinformation. Yeah. No shit chatter. Do you think that the dune song started [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1760.98s)]
*  playing in the fucking auditorium after he said that? No, it's clipped because he's, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1767.3s)]
*  he's restating what Ilhan Omar had said, but we like to have, we like to meme around a little [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1773.54s)]
*  bit around these parts. Like I didn't, that's crazy that you thought that that was like something [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1778.9s)]
*  that he genuinely said, like sincerely said. That's hilarious. It's real to me. Damn it. Okay. I will [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1783.46s)]
*  not, I will not have this question. Donald Trump genuinely said that he said that and he was [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1790.5800000000002s)]
*  actually being real when he said that. Anyone else? So that was the question. It was not the question [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1798.42s)]
*  that she was not kidnapped, that she was not tortured. I did not talk about any of this. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1804.18s)]
*  Well, you, you did criticize some Western outlets for humanizing the hostages. You are not humanized. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1808.66s)]
*  Well, my, I guess my question to you is wouldn't the better approach to be to humanize everyone, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1814.74s)]
*  to treat all humans. Do you know what I'm going through every day? I cannot even imagine. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1820.3400000000001s)]
*  I can't deal with this. I can't like these people are fucking barbaric in the way that they [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1827.0600000000002s)]
*  shamelessly dehumanize people, dehumanize Palestinians to their faces. It's like, wow, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1834.3400000000001s)]
*  why don't you have more grace for people who have participated in a military campaign against you? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1840.3400000000001s)]
*  Like all lives matter. All lives matter directly to the face of someone who is victim. Anyway, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1848.02s)]
*  once again, common score says EW. This made me really happy to celebrate Mosul Babatowah's [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1853.3s)]
*  new Pulitzer. The stars came out left and right himself and his wife Maram, Judith Thurman, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1858.26s)]

*  that's a joke. Obviously she's saying that as a joke, but that made me really fucking stoked. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1868.74s)]
*  That is cool as hell, dude. That is cool as fuck. Seeing Martin score says he show support like this. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1873.3s)]
*  That's that is amazing. Yeah. That is cinema. Okay. That is fucking keynote. That's cinema. I [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1882.98s)]
*  love that. All right. Let's get back to Eden Alexander. Now this is believed to still hold [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1891.78s)]
*  the bodies of four Israeli Americans. Let's get right to NBC's Halegorani who was live for us in [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1896.1s)]
*  Tel Aviv with the latest, by the way, after Eden, there are still 20 hostages, prisoners of war [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1900.82s)]
*  that are, that are still in the hands of Hamas and a total number of, I believe 58 now, the, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1908.26s)]
*  the rest are, are dead. And Israel is, is refusing to deal with Hamas and also has implemented the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1916.34s)]
*  starvation campaign. As we talked about already, it's more than two months now where famine has [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1925.4599999999998s)]
*  reached critical levels in the strip. They're not letting in any fucking aid. And I think the reason [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1930.5s)]
*  why Hamas cut this side deal as a show of good faith to the Americans was because they, they think [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1935.4599999999998s)]
*  that Americans will actually put an end to this, put an end to this ethnic cleansing. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1941.94s)]
*  Hopefully, hopefully they're right. We've seen cheers erupt in New Jersey, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1949.3s)]
*  Hala and in Israel where you are, we expect to see this hand of work or any minute. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1954.5s)]
*  Right. We understand that the Red Cross and Red Crescent convoy carrying Eden Alexander, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1961.3s)]
*  Halle is now on the way out on its way out of the Gaza strip from there. Eden will be transported [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1965.94s)]
*  to Rayim air base. Dude, don't say dumb shit like this. Just finished watching the Vod to catch up [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1972.26s)]
*  with your detainment stuff. Just crazy. I'm deleting the Twitch app and discord from my phone. When I [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1976.42s)]

*  It's via chopper and he will be meeting up and reuniting with his loved ones. Yael Alexander, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=1998.58s)]

*  Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv, 584 days. The deal that led to the release of Eden Alexander, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2010.58s)]
*  interestingly, was struck as a result of direct negotiations between the Trump administration and [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2017.78s)]
*  Hamas bypassing the Israeli government and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. We [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2024.1000000000001s)]

*  By the way, here's another fucking insane thing that took place. If you recall Netanyahu freaked [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2035.54s)]
*  out when Trump's team initiated direct talks with Hamas for Eden Alexander. And then they fucking [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2040.74s)]
*  targeted the site where Eden was being held, raising new questions about it's used to the [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2045.62s)]
*  Hannibal directive to kill hostages in Gaza and thereby reduce the main priority of political [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2050.1s)]
*  leverage for Hamas. Since October 7, Israel's killed dozens of Israeli citizens in Gaza. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2053.22s)]
*  And there's every reason to believe that it is done according to the official Hannibal [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2057.22s)]
*  directive orders. Like now they're stating, Oh, maybe Hamas was lying. Maybe Hamas was lying [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2060.3399999999997s)]
*  about that. That bombing campaign that took place. We don't know, but just letting you know, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2067.7s)]
*  we'll find out. We'll find out now that Eden has been released, if he actually was under threat or [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2073.38s)]
*  not. With president Trump, who a tour of Gulf Arab states in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, as well as the UAE, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2078.42s)]
*  Eden Alexander, the last living American hostage hostage. And as you mentioned, four other hostages [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2086.98s)]
*  deceased are still inside of the besieged enclave. Their bodies have not been returned by Hamas to [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2093.2200000000003s)]
*  their loved ones. We believe that potentially there had been a possibility that these bodies [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2100.98s)]
*  would also be sent back along with Eden Alexander, but it doesn't appear to be the case. So Eden [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2106.7400000000002s)]
*  right now in ICRC custody, soon to be handed over to Israeli special forces and then reunited with [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2112.1s)]
*  his family. Hallie, we're keeping an eye on that helicopter there in Reem in southern Israel, all [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2119.22s)]
*  as president Trump. Holla, as you mentioned, is getting ready to head to the region himself. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2124.1s)]
*  To be clear, Holla, we don't know the condition of Eden Alexander, correct? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2127.78s)]
*  Nobody's seen him. It's not clear how he's doing. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2132.5s)]
*  Correct. And it's interesting to note that we did not have these ceremonies that we saw in previous [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2137.38s)]
*  hostage exchanges with, you know, the certificates given to hostages who were released by Hamas. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2144.34s)]
*  This could be because the United States asked Hamas not to put on a propaganda show. We don't [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2152.3399999999997s)]
*  exactly know why, but it is very different to the previous hostage releases. We don't know what [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2159.54s)]
*  condition he's in. The last proof of life video came out last April. There was one in November [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2164.98s)]
*  where he directly appealed to President Donald Trump for his release. We know that if he goes [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2170.98s)]
*  to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv, it means he doesn't need immediate care, because if he needs [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2176.02s)]
*  immediate medical attention, it will be given to him at the air base. We understand, Holla. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2180.9s)]
*  Holla, I'm going to ask you to stand by for a moment. I want to get to Gabe Gutierrez, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2185.78s)]
*  who is live for us at the White House. And you heard Holla mention, Gabe, this is the result [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2188.5s)]
*  of apparently direct talks between the Trump administration and Hamas. And in just the last [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2192.5s)]
*  couple of seconds here, we've received a statement from Hamas confirming, in fact, that Eden Alexander [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2197.3s)]
*  has been released by them after contact with the American administration, with the Trump [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2202.6600000000003s)]
*  administration here, all of this essentially to unlock perhaps the steps toward a ceasefire [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2207.78s)]
*  and more humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza. Yes, certainly, Hallie. The administration is [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2213.46s)]
*  selling this as a major foreign policy win. And we heard from President Trump just a short time [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2218.26s)]
*  ago here at the White House at the Roosevelt Room where he was asked questions about this deal. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2223.6200000000003s)]
*  The president's saying that this hostage release was imminent. Now, he just departed the White [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2227.5400000000004s)]
*  House en route to that major international trip that you just mentioned, this trip to the Middle [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2232.34s)]
*  East where he's heading to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar, and also the United Arab Emirates. There was some [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2238.02s)]
*  talk about whether the president might potentially be going to Israel during this trip, but he said, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2243.54s)]
*  no, he was not. And, Hallie, what you've been discussing is very interesting. In this hostage [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2247.7000000000003s)]
*  release, the president and his administration bypassing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2253.3s)]
*  and from NBC's reporting we have learned over the last several weeks, there has become an [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2258.74s)]
*  increasingly strained relationship between the White House and Benjamin Netanyahu. President Trump, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2263.06s)]
*  according to sources, apparently frustrated with the military offensive that Netanyahu has started [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2268.9799999999996s)]
*  back up again in Gaza. And also, Netanyahu was apparently shocked when President Trump announced [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2275.14s)]
*  the ceasefire with the Houthis, of course, at a run back militant group in Yemen. The White House [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2281.7s)]
*  coming to an agreement with the Houthis that they would no longer attack U.S. forces. However, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2288.18s)]
*  the Houthis did not make that same agreement to Israel, and now Netanyahu has vowed to defend [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2292.74s)]
*  themselves. But again, this comes after a big weekend that the White House is trying to sell [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2297.62s)]
*  after several developments, not just in this, but also a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2303.7799999999997s)]
*  and also the temporary trade deal that was struck over the weekend with China regarding tariffs, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2310.18s)]
*  Hala. I want to point out to folks what you're seeing on your screen here. The left side, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2316.58s)]
*  Teneflay, New Jersey, you are seeing people applauding there, holding up the Israeli flag. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2320.2599999999998s)]
*  We saw cheers erupt when word came through that Edan Alexander, who of course was born and raised [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2325.14s)]
*  in New Jersey, he's from there, was in Red Cross custody. On the right side, that is a live shot, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2330.34s)]
*  looking at that helicopter there in southern Israel. And Hala, the timing of all this is [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2334.66s)]
*  particularly interesting, as Israel had been planning to ramp up its offensive on the ground in Gaza. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2339.22s)]
*  Yes, indeed. And Israel had said when the security cabinet unanimously voted to expand its offensive [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2346.74s)]
*  inside the Gaza Strip, it has to be said, not a decision that is very popular in Israel and [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2352.2599999999998s)]
*  certainly not among hostage families, that they would executing that plan if a ceasefire deal was [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2358.02s)]
*  struck between Hamas and Israel. Now, this is not one of those deals. This is a U.S.-Hamas agreement [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2364.74s)]
*  that led to the release of just one American hostage. It is not a deal that calls for a [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2371.54s)]
*  ceasefire. In fact, Israel even said they are not going to stop bombing the Gaza Strip, that they [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2376.9s)]
*  would just facilitate some sort of- Is it better now? I lowered the exposure myself, but I guess [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2382.42s)]
*  it wasn't enough because the lights keep coming in and out, but I think it's better. Yeah. All right. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2388.66s)]
*  I'm gonna go for a walk. Okay. Yo, if you can. Well, no, I was going to say, can you give me zins? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2394.66s)]
*  Sixers, like get a sleeve. If I didn't have time to, I didn't. Well, you're going on a walk anyway. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2403.06s)]
*  What's up? You almost got what would happen if I got, what would happen if I got detained? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2410.5s)]
*  What are you, what are you going to do in that situation? I don't, you're like, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2415.62s)]
*  I don't know this motherfucker at all. Sir, I have no idea who this guy is. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2419.2999999999997s)]
*  If you can give me a sleeve of Sixers of coffee or citrus, but coffee preferred. Oh yeah. Here. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2425.7s)]
*  Turn the angelic background back on. No, it's fine. This is good. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2433.8599999999997s)]
*  Proper turn for a sleeve is a log. I work with Kat's campaign. I can't go to Kat's campaign. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2438.5s)]
*  I can't do that today. I'm literally in a couple hours. I'm going to be heading over to university [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2444.34s)]
*  of Chicago to do a speech. Okay. I love Kat. I think she's wonderful. She's fantastic, but I [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2449.6200000000003s)]
*  can't do that today. I'm, I'm barely getting through a couple of news stories before or to get [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2455.38s)]
*  Eda and Alexander out. So we are not there yet. We don't know really, certainly the hostage families [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2461.3s)]
*  and Palestinians of course, as well, really hope that this is the case, that this will lead to some [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2468.1000000000004s)]
*  sort of hostage prisoner exchange and a long lasting truce. Howie. And there had been some [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2473.3s)]
*  pressure on the Israeli government. How love for months now with these demonstrations in what's [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2478.5800000000004s)]
*  called hostage square there in Tel Aviv. I've seen them in my time in Israel, the Israeli air [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2483.3s)]
*  forces resumes the air strikes on the Gaza strip passing meter reports after a pause of several [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2488.42s)]
*  hours during the release of hostages, a hostage soldier, Eda and Alexander, the idea of limited [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2491.78s)]
*  his activity in Gaza state enabled the release of Alexander. That's fucking dude, dude. The other [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2496.02s)]
*  side of the story is that this lights a fire under the asses of all of the Israelis that have [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2502.02s)]
*  been protesting against Benjamin and Yahoo. The number of protesters that are against the genocide [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2508.74s)]
*  is growing as well, which is crazy. That obviously is super, super marginal. Let's be real, but the [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2515.06s)]
*  standing together style, liberal Zionists have even started demonstrating for Palestinians, which is [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2523.46s)]
*  new. It's unique. It's certainly growing. It's still a, again, minuscule percentage of the Israeli [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2531.46s)]
*  Jewish population, but nonetheless, every day that number is growing. And it's important here, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2539.94s)]
*  every damn day, Jerusalem anti-war protest featuring images of Gaza and children, even as the IDF is [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2546.58s)]
*  striking hard in Gaza again tonight, following the release of Eden Alexander. And not only that, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2550.58s)]
*  but the number of, uh, release the hostages, uh, people that hate Netanyahu has, has exploding. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2555.06s)]
*  Okay. So there is, there is a lot of, there is a lot, a lot of anger and a lot of resentment [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2564.02s)]
*  as Benjamin Netanyahu actively states his, uh, overall goals for the quote unquote war, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2571.86s)]
*  which is just genocide and permanent occupation of the Gaza strip. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2577.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, I know you have as well as, as people in Israel, uh, had wanted the Netanyahu government [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2581.06s)]
*  to do more to try to get these hostages out. Well, it's interesting. I wasn't guy who got [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2588.1800000000003s)]
*  released is refusing to meet in any Yahoo. Yeah. I wonder why, because Netanyahu tried to kill him, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2593.1400000000003s)]
*  dude. What do you mean? Like there's yeah, I wouldn't want to either report Eden Alexander [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2598.9s)]
*  suffered severe torture and captivity was kept handcuffed in a cage is what times of Israel is [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2606.98s)]
*  saying. Like, and Al Jazeera is stating that he doesn't want to meet Benjamin and Yahoo. Who knows? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2611.78s)]
*  Maybe he will. Okay. Maybe he will. We'll see the most annoying type of person speaking from [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2618.66s)]
*  personal experience. So those who support Netanyahu's war essentially unconditionally, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2625.3s)]
*  every step of the way, but also demand hostages be returned. Basically saying the Hamas are the [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2628.42s)]
*  only ones responsible. What's happening in Israel is both not doing enough, but shouldn't change [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2631.54s)]
*  anything that they're doing. Yeah. Can you show us what us custom saw on your phone? I didn't [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2634.82s)]
*  give them my phone. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2639.46s)]
*  Speaker 2, 1h 10m 22s [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2640.26s)]
*  Hostage square today. And I spoke with the father of a soldier who is still in Hamas [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2641.54s)]
*  captivity inside of the Gaza strip and family after family has been telling us that they want [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2648.34s)]
*  president Trump to put pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu because they believe many of them [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2655.6200000000003s)]
*  that Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel is restarting this war for political and [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2660.8199999999997s)]
*  not strategic reasons that he believes that if he stops the war, the extreme right wing members [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2666.2599999999998s)]
*  of his coalition government will abandon him and his government will fall. And he will have to face [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2673.06s)]
*  some of these legal problems and criminal trials that he, that, that essentially threatened his [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2678.1s)]
*  political career. And in fact, his, his freedom, if indeed he is not in power anymore. And so [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2684.1s)]
*  that is kind of interesting that you have this timing. Is it, they've been saying that what's [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2690.58s)]
*  interesting is now you're covering it. American news. It's not interesting that Israeli society [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2696.2599999999998s)]
*  has been saying that they've written letters in the last ceasefire negotiations. There were [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2702.74s)]
*  hostage family members that wrote direct letters that were reported in Israeli media and got [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2708.58s)]
*  very little coverage in American media that stated directly, not only that Benjamin Netanyahu was [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2714.02s)]
*  spoiling the fucking negotiations, but that his ambitions were for permanent war. And also on [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2720.34s)]
*  top of that, they literally signaled, they singled out the policies, the, the spoiler provisions that [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2726.18s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu added last second. This wasn't like brilliant forum policy analyst. This was just [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2734.02s)]
*  directly the fucking hostage families that wrote letters that were reported on in Israeli media [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2740.82s)]
*  that stated that Benjamin Netanyahu's last minute, erroneous decision, irresponsible decision to [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2747.86s)]
*  refuse to remove troops from the, the Philadelphia corridor is directly done so that they can put, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2755.7000000000003s)]
*  they can never engage in, in real honest ceasefire discussions to take the hostages out. They wrote [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2763.54s)]
*  this. They said it, the Israeli hostage family said it. It's not new. It's not unique. It's not [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2770.1s)]
*  shocking. And it's only shocking if you are in this insane misinformation bubble where you're not [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2776.18s)]
*  paying close attention to anything that's going on, or rather you're emitting key details in your [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2784.02s)]
*  coverage in an effort to make it seem like what Israel's ethnic cleansing campaign is actually [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2788.98s)]
*  seemingly a justifiable campaign in and of itself. It's not. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2794.5s)]
*  When it is, when you have this, this release of a hostage taking place without the prime minister [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2800.3399999999997s)]
*  having been involved in the negotiations and only we understand informed of the result [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2807.2999999999997s)]
*  of the negotiations after the fact. Let me go back to Gabe there who is at the White House for us. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2811.7799999999997s)]
*  And Gabe, it is still a question mark as to whether president Trump may meet with [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2817.46s)]
*  Alexander depending on his condition, may meet with members of the Alexander family who we know [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2821.3s)]
*  have traveled and made their way to the region here. Talk us through what we expect to see from [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2825.6200000000003s)]
*  the president this week as his administration, his top envoy here to the Middle East has described [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2829.6200000000003s)]
*  this as just a tremendous victory, not just obviously for the Alexander family, but for [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2834.42s)]
*  the president himself. Yeah, certainly Steve Witkoff, that envoy to the Middle East and is [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2838.82s)]
*  extremely busy over the last several weeks and months, not just with the war in Gaza, but also [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2842.9s)]
*  the war in Ukraine as well. But as you said, you don't Alexander's family potentially could [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2848.42s)]
*  meet president Trump later on this week in Qatar. Unclear if that will happen or not. We understand [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2854.26s)]
*  that that will be up to Alexander's family as well as a condition of, of, of now that he's been [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2860.1800000000003s)]
*  released. But this is a major foreign trip, Hallie, for president Trump, the first of his [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2868.1s)]
*  second term. This international trip will include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and also the United Arab [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2874.1s)]
*  Emirates. And as I was mentioning earlier, trade will be a big part of this trip. Also, we understand [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2879.06s)]
*  from White House officials that the president going there to seek deals with those countries [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2885.62s)]
*  in the Middle East. And we expect that to come up again through over the next couple of days. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2891.06s)]
*  But there's a lot of controversy as well that we've been hearing over the last day or so, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2897.7s)]
*  President Trump agreeing to accept a multi-million dollar, hundreds of million dollar jumbo jet [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2901.62s)]
*  from the Qatari government to serve potentially as the next Air Force One, then be given to [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2907.94s)]
*  President Trump's presidential library. So we expect questions about that to come up over the [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2913.22s)]
*  next couple of days. Again, we just heard from President Trump a short time ago here at the [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2917.7799999999997s)]
*  White House, the president trying to make the case that he would be a quote, stupid person to reject [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2921.94s)]
*  that jumbo jet because it was a gift from the Qatari government. Still questions though about [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2927.46s)]
*  whether there could be security implications as well from that gift, but back to this trip, Hallie, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2933.86s)]
*  the White House is, I love that. I think haters need to, yeah, what's good. I think haters need, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2939.3s)]
*  oh, you did. You are, Oh, I love you. Oh my God. Hell yeah. Damn. That's crazy. Worse timing. Not [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2949.22s)]
*  to have your mega hat, bro. I know. I know this is, I, I need to pack a mega hat for security [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2963.22s)]
*  purposes anyway, when I'm like getting through customs, but I need it right now. I need it for [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2970.4199999999996s)]
*  this fucking moment. Like I need it for this moment. Let me tell you something. Okay. I don't [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2976.26s)]
*  know. I give a fuck. I've, I can't believe I'm saying this. I do not give a fuck about [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2980.0200000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump getting bribed by the Qatar government. Okay. Straight up bribe away, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2987.38s)]
*  my friend bribe the fuck away. Okay. If it's going to, if it's going to play a formative role in [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=2993.78s)]
*  Donald Trump, seeing Arabs as human beings and maybe even playing a role in him, like managing [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3002.26s)]
*  this situation a little bit better. Oh, oh, I'm nutting. Okay. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so amazing. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3009.1400000000003s)]
*  Fuck yes. Please bribe away. I have never been more pro bribery than at this fucking moment. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3017.6200000000003s)]
*  This bribe was just made public. That's the only difference in this issue. Oh, it's so good. It's [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3024.5800000000004s)]
*  so fucking good. How come Israel gets the, how come Israel gets the fucking grease the wheels on [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3028.82s)]
*  a daily fucking basis, but Qatar is not allowed to suck my dick. Okay. Thrill to see this hostage [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3034.1800000000003s)]
*  release. This is something that they have been working for, for quite some time, the last remaining [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3040.1800000000003s)]
*  American hostage. And they point to what they see as not just a point to what they see as a successful [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3045.06s)]
*  negotiation on the part of the administration. And certainly we expect to hear more from the president [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3052.1000000000004s)]
*  about these developments as they unfold throughout the day. The president, again, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3058.1s)]
*  currently on his way to Saudi Arabia as we speak, Callie. Gabe, thank you. You are looking live now [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3062.74s)]
*  at a small gathering of people along the side of the road there in Southern Israel in Reem. That [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3068.2599999999998s)]
*  is where the helicopter is awaiting the Red Cross, which is bringing Edan Alexander back from the [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3072.5s)]
*  Gaza Strip into Israel. He will then be taken to that hospital in Tel Aviv, which is where we find [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3078.74s)]
*  our Hala Gurani. And Hala, what does this mean now for the potential for the chances of a ceasefire [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3083.7s)]
*  moving forward? Well, it's difficult to say because this was more of a one-off, it seems, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3088.8999999999996s)]
*  than the result of any kind of long-term strategic discussion between the two sides. After all, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3095.2999999999997s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu was not involved in this. His negotiators were not involved in this. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3101.54s)]
*  The U.S. administration and the Trump envoys were talking directly to Hamas. Will this put pressure [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3106.1s)]
*  on the prime minister of Israel to potentially back off and cancel or postpone the offensive that [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3111.62s)]
*  his security cabinet voted unanimously to carry out? Or will he believe that for his political [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3118.18s)]
*  survival, this is something that he needs to do? Those are all open questions, Hallie. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3124.3399999999997s)]
*  Many questions still remaining as we continue to follow this breaking news from out of the Middle [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3129.14s)]
*  East. Hala Gurani, live for us in Tel Aviv. Thank you. Our thanks to Gabe Gutierrez, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3133.94s)]
*  live at the white house as well. We will continue to monitor, of course, as the last [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3138.5s)]
*  living American hostage believed to be held in Gaza is now on his way to freedom. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3142.9s)]
*  And Trump takes reporters questions at press briefing after we'll obviously cover. This is [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3147.54s)]
*  why I actually watched this live today when I was at the gym. Oh my God. Oh my Lord. Oh my freaking [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3151.62s)]
*  Lord. Oh Lordy. So obviously we got the tariffs. I'm not done with this. The, the, like the U.S. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3160.98s)]
*  Israel decoupling a little bit, but one more thing to talk about with Biden, because a lot of people [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3169.3s)]
*  are asking me, Hey, what do you think? What do you think about like Kamala Harris now? And the reality [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3175.46s)]
*  of the matter is I've said the same thing that I said last time around, which is that yes, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3184.34s)]
*  Donald Trump being a brash. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_ZqZP2vuk&t=3190.82s)]
