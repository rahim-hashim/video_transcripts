*  They got fouls on that shot. Oh, oh, oh, and the spin. Oh, still on his pivot, though. Still on his [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=612.6s)]

*  offense? Oh, he's in his spot. Same spot. It's bread and butter. That is cheese. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=635.56s)]
*  Topper trying to get another foul call. It is. It's a very one on one move. He's backing him down. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=640.84s)]
*  That's crazy. I think he shoots this one. Oh, I lied. Oh, damn. Ref is just not moving. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  Ref is just calm. He's like, keep playing. Five, two. Will he end it with a three? He thought about it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=656.12s)]
*  He could. He's just so good in the paint, though. I think he wants to end it. He retreated. Good [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=664.6s)]
*  defense. The post. This is where he lives. And where he dies. You guys do this for content? I know. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=671.16s)]
*  It's crazy. Oh, my God. He's gas, bro. He is gas. I feel like at this point, you're down five, two. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=678.44s)]
*  Especially how Jeff's not backing down on defense. Wait, what? He tried to menace. He tried. Oh, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=684.0400000000001s)]

*  How you feel? I loved the ref not calling anything because it's going both ways, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=742.2s)]
*  but you did great. Better than I expected. Thanks, bro. Not better than me. I'm sorry. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=745.88s)]
*  And the next matchup is Frigga versus Julian Newman. My name is Julian Newman. I grew up playing [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=754.0400000000001s)]
*  ball all my life. As a fifth grader, I played on a high school varsity basketball team. From then, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=761.4s)]

*  called The Next Chapter and we actually do a lot of basketball content and then on my own personal [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=775.0s)]
*  channel, I do basketball content as well. I say I have some experience in the one v one, but I [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=780.1999999999999s)]
*  definitely came here to pick up that 10,000 today. My score prediction is seven four. Bro, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=784.68s)]
*  uh, that man is a demon. Okay. No, I'm not talking about Julian. I mean, he's, he's good too, but [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=789.64s)]
*  for me. Okay. I like it. Okay. Anybody, anybody. This is it, man. I'm excited. Obviously, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=796.52s)]
*  Frigga's got a big height advantage. It is unlimited dribble though. So Julian can do his [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=803.48s)]
*  crazy dribble package, bro. It looks like he's like double his size. Who do you got when [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=808.4399999999999s)]

*  Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Back drive spin move. Oh, hold on. If you got two hands on his waist [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=835.48s)]
*  and he does that, I'm going to get it up top. We're going to check it up top. You can't put two hands [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=842.84s)]
*  on it. It was an automatic foul. He needs to make that top of the key. Bang. And he will. Two off. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=846.6s)]
*  Frigga's got some aura on the court. He does. Usually he's very nice, but he's on his villain [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=852.76s)]
*  arc. He's been talking trash to everybody. What did he say to you? He said, I suck. Wow. Wow. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=856.76s)]
*  And one. Four, two. He's not an influencer. He's a hooper. He's a hooper. Step back. And one. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=862.52s)]
*  Gets the foul on the three. Bro, he's calling it the one way. Hey, listen, play basketball. I'm not [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=870.52s)]
*  that guy. Just play ball. Oh, Julian's known to talk trash to the ref. This dude didn't go bad for him. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=878.68s)]
*  And he didn't even hit the ball. He's standing in the court doing nothing. Hey, hey, hey, hey. He's [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=883.88s)]
*  cool. I got you. And he played through your foul. And you played through your foul. You're grabbing [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=888.6s)]
*  him every possession. Yeah, this shit, it got heated. Play it through with it. You want to blame [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=894.4399999999999s)]
*  it on the ref? Because you ripped my man's shirt. And I did that. That's crazy, bro. The next chapter [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=898.6s)]
*  and the next hole has happened. Oh my God. You're a clown, bro. You're a clown. You better watch your [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=903.88s)]
*  mouth. I don't care. Watch your mouth. Point count? Yes. Bucket good. Five two. See you later. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=911.24s)]
*  Uh oh. It's a two v one. And that's a foul. Why you calling him? For what? I'm gonna let, he gonna [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=917.4s)]
*  win on his own. I don't even call nothing for him. I love it. Oh my gosh. What was that? I thought [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=924.2s)]
*  this was YouTube. Not bloopers. No, you don't want to get. Okay, I'll just say it like this. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=932.76s)]
*  It got very heated. And I don't know how they edited it. But all I'm gonna say is, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=939.64s)]
*  there was a lot of back and forth of himself coming in out of nowhere. That's all I'm gonna say. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  Also, they did cook Julian by putting him up next to Frigga in the first round. Like that's, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=953.16s)]
*  you know, that's not going to be any, nobody's going to have a good day in that process. I mean, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=958.3599999999999s)]
*  he's a fucking demon. Yeah. And of course, someone was instigating on the sidelines. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=963.08s)]
*  I won't point fingers. I don't know who it was, but someone was stirring the dang pot. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=979.5600000000001s)]
*  Just play. Jesse, you got security? That's my security. That's crazy. I'm trying to see some [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=987.48s)]

*  you ain't got to hurt people. That's you. You're not letting them land, bro. So if I call it, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=996.2800000000001s)]
*  it's a bad call. When I don't call it, it's a bad call. What does he want? Hey, technical, technical. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1000.44s)]
*  Give him a technical. Technical foul, bro. Hey, watch your mouth, boy. Watch your mouth, boy. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1006.2s)]

*  Maybe not that big, but he looks, he looks like he looks like he's got some big ass quads. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1380.2s)]
*  Oh my. What a step through and a bucket. That's tough. Five to three and Jesse is two points away [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1387.0s)]
*  from winning this matchup. I'm ending this. He could go for the win. You think he's going to? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1393.4s)]
*  I think he will. For the win. No way. Oh. I told you that's his point. If he would have made that, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1397.48s)]
*  the crowd would have erupted. Good shot. Boom. Five to four. Good drive. He needs, oh, that's my move. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1405.72s)]
*  Wow. Five to five. The score is tied up. We are going straight up. So a two pointer wins here. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1414.76s)]
*  They're both exhausted for the win. Oh my God. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1421.24s)]
*  Nelson with the dub seven to five. We did it. We did it. Anything is possible. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1431.6399999999999s)]
*  A great matchup. Respect. Respect. He has a strep though. I did not know that. He has a strep. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1437.96s)]
*  Congratulations. Nelson is moving on in the one V one tournament. And the next round we have [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1444.44s)]
*  Christopher. We made fun of him quite a bit for getting beat by a toddler, but yeah, he's really [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1448.84s)]
*  good. Oh, tall man. Verse. Kais. That's an interesting one. What's good. I'm Chris London, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1455.3999999999999s)]
*  AKA LSK. I make a basketball content. Who would have thought just because I haven't played in a [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1463.48s)]
*  couple of months. I think today is going to be that day. My name is Kai Somar and I make sneaker [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1469.32s)]
*  content. I'm a pretty consistent Hooper. I play a couple of times a week. Y'all better watch out. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1473.88s)]
*  I got Chris. I mean, he's got six, 10. Yeah, he is very tall. Oh, oh, oh, the pump fake right there. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1479.0s)]
*  Damn. Oh, off the rip. Oh, a good little bump right there. Pain away. Oh, it's a butter shot. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1484.28s)]
*  Butter. He's so nasty. Look at him. Oh, my God. Oh, my goodness. It's a setup. That would have been [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1489.88s)]
*  the play of the tournament. I would have left. Oh, he tried. He tried it. He tried it. He tried it. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1504.92s)]
*  You got to get crafty. You got to get the clip back. Oh, duck on him, Chris. It's a spin. Oh, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1511.0s)]
*  he hurts you. Oh, pain. Oh, pain. Tough bucket. Tough bucket. Two oh, pretty much unguardable. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1517.24s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. He's going to hit that. And he's still got a shot. Hey, yo. Oh, my God. That's a tough [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1522.44s)]
*  shot. He has the in his bag. He needs a three. He's taking a three. 100%. I would bet my life. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1531.48s)]
*  He's literally the Yanis scuff Yuki versus scuff Wemby. All right. Now the Yanis. Sorry. Why am [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1535.72s)]
*  I saying Yanis? He's the fucking Wemby build. He is the Wemby of this tourney. $100. $100. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1541.88s)]
*  You even got $100. There's a rim. Yes. No, that was a two. I take cash out. He beat me and I owe [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1549.96s)]
*  $100. Damn. Oh, okay. Oh, he should have shot that way. Double step back. He's back in the game. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1557.88s)]
*  Comeback season right here. I'm feeling it. Oh, and he still has it. He put all he did to sleep. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1568.84s)]
*  He's emoting. Hey, that's crazy. Pull it. Just pull it. He has like an eight point wave. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1577.08s)]
*  Oh, no. Oh, no. Six, four. All right. He ends right now. That's what I'm saying. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1593.0s)]
*  I'll bet you $100 that Kai gets a six. Oh, hand down, man down. He let him shoot that. Hands are [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1597.72s)]
*  down. There's no way. Oh, no. All the way back here. All the way back here. Dang. No way. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1603.16s)]
*  I was very nervous. Chatter asked me how nervous were you. I was very fucking nervous. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1615.48s)]
*  Next point. No way. No way. Oh, that was a shot. Hey, you still got power. Oh, game. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1621.48s)]
*  Game. Oh, got hit in the head. Took him out. Damn. In the game and in real life. All right. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1631.8s)]
*  Every time I talk trash, the opponent just always ups and makes some buckets and I almost lost. But [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1638.2s)]
*  hey, it's an ugly win, but I won. So when he walked away on your three, did that give you the [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1644.04s)]
*  motivation to start the comeback? It was the dunk attempt. I'm like, all right, he's trying to get [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1648.52s)]
*  a high five. All right. So that was a great game. Onto the next one. Hudson versus Hassan. I'm so [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1652.92s)]
*  scared. We got the final matchup of the first round. So neither of you host basketball content, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1663.0s)]
*  but you both hoop. So what's your experience? I've played in middle school and that was the [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1667.6399999999999s)]
*  last time I played in a league, but you know, I hoop occasionally. I think I got this. I'm going [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1671.48s)]
*  to make sure I leave with that check. Okay. Oh damn. He's going all the way. Okay. I'm nowhere near [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1675.56s)]
*  as confident as Hudson is. I'm an old man. I feel like they brought me out here specifically. So like, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1681.3999999999999s)]
*  you know, they can do some dunk compilations off of like a person that at least is comparable in [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1686.6s)]
*  size to like a Chris or a J-dub, but I do hoop. Like I enjoy it. I'm just here to have fun. Hassan [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1690.84s)]
*  has a minus six spread. So I'm going to take that. Minus six spread? Yeah. Oh, top of the key. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1696.6s)]
*  Bang! You left him open. Who do you got winning? I got Hassan as well. Hassan, I also got Hassan. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1703.3999999999999s)]
*  He just has more confidence. Okay. I've never really seen Hudson hoop. Oh, he's a lefty. He's a lefty. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1707.56s)]
*  Bro, he can't score again or I'm cooked. Oh, you bet on this game? Yeah, minus six, Hassan. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1715.08s)]
*  Oh, behind the bat. Wait a minute. Oh, he almost banked it in. Top, he's leaning it open. He's [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1719.0s)]
*  taking it. Bro, you got to guard that Hudson. You got to step up. Dude, he reminds me of like a [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1724.84s)]
*  1960s Power Forward. Five, one. Oh, good pump. Six, one. He is at game point. This guy's stressful. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1729.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely stressful guarding that move. That is game. That was a quick matchup. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1737.64s)]
*  Congratulations. You're moving to the second round. You're playing Chris. Bully? Oh no. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1743.8000000000002s)]
*  Fuck you mean bully? I'm sorry. I can't fucking play. First of all, I did a pretty decent job [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1750.0400000000002s)]
*  of just like not actually backing him in at all. That's not bully ball at all. What do you mean? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1757.0s)]
*  He's taking it. I shoot it. You got to step up. Oh, good pump. I didn't even do contact there. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1763.56s)]
*  Six, one. He is at game point. This guy's stressful. Yeah, it's definitely stressful guarding that move. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1770.6s)]
*  Literally, virtually none of that is like. That is game. That was a quick matchup. Congratulations. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1777.48s)]
*  You're moving to the second round. You're playing Chris. I didn't even think I'd beat Hudson. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1785.24s)]
*  Yeah, you got it. Yeah, just catch Chris in the bathroom. Give him a little hook. I got you. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1791.08s)]
*  I got you. All right, on to the second round. Big second round matchup. We got Cash versus Sean. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1795.16s)]
*  Sean, what is about to happen? I apologize, man. I'm so sorry. What happened? Why are you apologizing? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1801.4s)]
*  For what's about to happen. He apologized. Hudson was really nice too. He said he's a Hasanabi head. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1807.24s)]
*  I felt bad. Just kidding. I didn't feel bad at all. Jason too. I'm going to show you mediterranean. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1813.48s)]
*  All right, man. Okay. Anything could happen. Who do you guys got in this matchup? Cash or Sean? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1819.4s)]
*  100% Sean. Sean's my boy, dude. Yeah. I got Sean making it all the way. 100%. That three point is [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1824.28s)]
*  deadly. Yo, Sean, win this for me. Yeah, for sure. He's doing it for us. Top of the key. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1829.4s)]
*  Three point game. Sean's winning. So far, that's what it is. So far, that's what it is. Sean's two. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1835.48s)]
*  Okay, let's cut that. Oh. All right. We don't talk about it. We don't talk about it. We don't talk [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1843.32s)]
*  about it. We don't talk about it. Cash. Cash. Dude, I don't know. Oh. That's some confidence. Oh. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1847.8799999999999s)]
*  That's a lethal move from Sean. We got a lot of light, let me tell you. Yo, don't make it [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1857.8s)]
*  predictable, Sean. He's got the step back. See, that's what's too predictable. Come on. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1862.04s)]
*  No, it doesn't matter. I like that crawl in very slow step back, but it's very technical. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1865.64s)]
*  He got in his head. Bro, he's in his head. Something Chris told me when he played against Cash where [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1872.6000000000001s)]
*  Cash won was that he plays a mind game. He's very good at getting in your head and especially if [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1876.92s)]
*  you're not able to shoot, he will use that to his advantage. And so far, it seems like Sean is doing [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1884.1200000000001s)]
*  exactly that to Cash. But finally, the first one comes in. I'm telling you guys, when it rains, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1889.5600000000002s)]
*  it pours with Cash. I feel like he's not talking too much this game. I am. He's poised. Yeah. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1894.6s)]
*  When it rains, it pours. Hey, yo, Sean, get up on him. He's missing this one. Oh. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1899.3999999999999s)]
*  What did I say? Oh my God. What did I say, Sean? When it rains, it pours. I want this win for you. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1906.52s)]
*  And now he's going to take it to the hat. No way. No way he makes more. That would have been crazy. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1911.9599999999998s)]
*  Will he be able to bring it back? Oh, he's posting up. That's a bad move. I like that. I like that. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1915.6399999999999s)]
*  I like this. No, it's a waste of energy, but he's a waste of energy for Sean. He doesn't need to do [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1921.56s)]
*  that at all. It's a bruiser. Everyone who's played Cash has told me this. He does drain your energy [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1927.3999999999999s)]
*  posting up. Game over. Game. And that's game. Two to eight. Oh, he's taking a, so you're magic trick, boy. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1933.24s)]
*  Oh, he's in no magic. He pulled that trick on me. Man. I think you impressed a lot of people today. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1942.92s)]
*  How did it feel in that final? No, I mean, honestly, even when I'm bad at things, I like to talk myself [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1954.28s)]
*  up. And so I was just. You're not bad at basketball, right? You're not. I didn't make it to the second round. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1959.0800000000002s)]
*  You did. I was doing a 15 year old. Hey, you better than Jason. That's true, but how hard is it really, Lily? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1964.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh, Jason got good. Jeff versus Frigga. You guys have never played, right? Never played. This is our first time meeting [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1972.8400000000001s)]
*  yesterday. Do you think you have what it takes to take him down? He's a favorite. I made a deal with [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1979.64s)]
*  Frigga that he can only take jump shots. So you're only shooting jumpers. Yeah. We'll see. Maybe, maybe not. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1984.28s)]
*  I think Jeff has what it takes. Yes, he's. Maybe like one in every 20 games Jeff wins it. No. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1990.92s)]
*  Maybe this is the 20th. That's crazy. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=1995.88s)]
*  I heard that from Japan. That was the loudest slap I've ever heard. Now, apparently, Frigga and Jeff made a deal [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2003.48s)]
*  that Frigga is only allowed to shoot jump shots. I never heard of that deal. Oh wow. That's what they said [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2010.5200000000002s)]
*  when I interviewed him. I was like, why would you take that? But I guess Frigga's confidence is 10. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2015.16s)]
*  Good. That's good. Wow. Wow. Four. Oh, you know, the one thing about Frigga is he's just so composed [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2019.8s)]
*  all the time, all the time, no emotion, just to make a buck. His moves are so good, dude. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2027.3999999999999s)]
*  Like he plays a perfect game. Pretty much [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2035.1599999999999s)]
*  great footwork. Apparently his whole like specialty, his whole specialty is doing the three dribble, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2039.5600000000002s)]
*  one on ones. And that is like, that's perfect for like developing really good, like developing a bag [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2047.5600000000002s)]
*  specifically off the jump. Like if you're doing three dribble, one on ones or four dribble, one on ones, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2056.2000000000003s)]
*  like you train this very specific skill set that only allows you to destroy in this sort of situation. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2061.56s)]
*  I mean, he's he, is he a D1 athlete as well? That's what someone was saying. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2069.48s)]
*  He's a hooper, hooper, hooper. Oh, he was a D3 Hooper and is better now than he was then. Yeah. So [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2075.24s)]
*  that's the other thing I heard. You're right. Yeah. He wasn't D1, but he wasn't a D1. He was [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2084.12s)]
*  D1, but he wasn't D1, but he did. He did get like a lot better after college because like skills, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2089.72s)]
*  the way he plays, he could have played. I think he could play D1. Like if he was at this skill level, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2099.08s)]
*  I think he could have played D1. Oh, look, nonchalant, just walking, walking him down [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2103.08s)]
*  to the rim. Jeff trying his best. He's holding his ground. Oh my gosh. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2111.3199999999997s)]
*  I gotta play a mix. Damn. You gotta play him next. Have you played him before? Yes, I beat Frigo. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2121.24s)]
*  Do it again. This is a different type of Frigo. Wait, he beat Frigo? Let me take Julian over you, but [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2127.56s)]
*  it depends. I feel like I gotta stop asking questions. This is a big matchup right here. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2134.4399999999996s)]
*  Now, Nelson, you said if you're feeling it, you can be anybody in this tournament. Yeah. How you [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2139.08s)]
*  feeling about going against him? Spectal matchup. It could be anybody's game, you know? You never [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2144.44s)]
*  know who's going to win. I'm going 7-3 again. 7-3. All right. This might be a pretty fun game, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2148.2s)]
*  but what makes this matchup interesting is the unlimited dribbler. Oh, good defense. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2152.7599999999998s)]
*  Break it. Break it. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, good lay. Oh my God. Deep three. Could he get three? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2156.68s)]
*  I still got J-Dub winning. I got J-Dub. You got J-Dub? I think once he goes down low, it's [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2164.12s)]
*  grabbed. But Nelson is like weirdly strong. Was he stopping you from driving a lot of times? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2169.56s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh, good defense. He does play good defense. J-Dub's giving it to him. Oh. Okay. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2175.4s)]
*  Okay. That's another bucket. Oh. That was incredible. That was mean. I ain't gonna lie. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2182.84s)]
*  That was mean. Oh, that's a big two. Oh, you gotta take that. Big two. You gotta take that. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2190.6s)]
*  If he gives it to you. He didn't even jump. The two-hand block. Oh, that's a bucket. There it is. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2195.56s)]
*  Three-two. Good defense. Oh. There it is. You gotta take the drives. Three to three. Yeah, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2202.2799999999997s)]
*  once you're losing, you gotta like switch the game plan. Oh, he's back to it. Back to it. Three to [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2208.6s)]
*  five. He's up. Oh, he's stuck. Got the blinders off. Bro, what? He can't see. What's his pivot [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2214.84s)]
*  foot there? That was crazy. He's got 99 hand in the face. Wait, am I crazy or did he actually? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2225.48s)]
*  He traveled. For the win. Oh, he's stuck. Got the blinders off. Oh, no. Blinders is crazy. He can't [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2233.7200000000003s)]
*  see. Fade. Wait. No, I don't know. He didn't travel. He didn't travel. I was wrong. No, he [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2240.76s)]
*  got a, what is it called? Like a gathered step, right? For the win. No, he didn't. He didn't [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2247.32s)]
*  travel. He never looked at his pivot foot. It's clear. It's clean. It's clean. It's clean. I [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2252.0400000000004s)]
*  didn't understand. I thought he. Got the blinders off. The blinders is crazy. He can't see. Fade. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2256.1200000000003s)]
*  He's got 99 hand in the face. Look at that. It's an energy game right now. He wants an open three [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2262.12s)]
*  and he's going to zigzag change. Oh. Nelson is kind of selling right now. I'm not going to lie. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2270.8399999999997s)]
*  That's a tough shot. Tough shot for the win. Oh, my God. JDubb is moving on to the semi-finals. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2279.64s)]
*  Oh, my God. That's a tough 15-year-old, bro. Made me work for it. Did you get a little nervous [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2288.2s)]
*  at any point? He had me for a second. I had to tighten up. Definitely. I definitely had to tighten [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2291.96s)]
*  up. GGs, boys. GGs. See you in the semi-finals. Yes, sir. We got a big matchup right here. Have [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2295.2400000000002s)]
*  y'all ever faced off before? We have not, but I've been meaning to. He came to my charity event that [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2300.84s)]
*  I did. Taught me how to shoot a three-pointer, basically. You taught him how to play. So this [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2305.88s)]
*  is, wait, is this teacher versus the student right now? I mean, I guess, but the only thing I have [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2309.56s)]
*  on him is potentially posting him down. He's a better shooter than me. He's faster than me. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2314.6s)]
*  He's better on D. It's going to be tough. Okay. Let's see what happens. You got Chris? You got [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2318.28s)]
*  Chris as well? I don't know. Hassan had such a dominant performance, and Chris almost didn't [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2323.6400000000003s)]
*  make it here. Yeah, if anyone can back down Chris, it will be Hassan, I would say. He's strong. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2328.1200000000003s)]
*  Honestly, I got Chris as well. Oh, my God. The bank three. He's already doing better than he [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2332.1200000000003s)]
*  predicted he would. Give me another one. Top shot. Another bank. No way. No way he banked it again. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2337.32s)]
*  With the NJ celly. Can't leave Hassan open at the top. He's actually got most of his points off the [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2346.04s)]
*  check. Give me another one. No way. It looked good. If he hit that one, my goodness. A one dribble pull. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2350.84s)]
*  Oh, I'm broke as hell. Yes. Oh, my God. The crowd is stunned. We're all stunned right now. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2358.44s)]
*  What is happening right now? Can Chris make the 7-0 comeback? Hassan just needs one more. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2368.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He was the top pick. He was like, it's between him, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2375.32s)]
*  J-Dub and Frigga are like the top three seeds and he got skunked. And it's kind of crazy because [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2394.92s)]
*  it's kind of crazy because like this is the biggest upset in the entire tournament. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2401.88s)]
*  But like I couldn't believe that I was able to do that. And I don't think he [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2406.2000000000003s)]
*  believed it either. He said he Chris has said he's never actually got skunked before. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2410.44s)]
*  Did you mean to bank those? Yeah, totally. Bro. He taught me how to shoot threes. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2417.88s)]
*  Student has beaten the teacher. You taught him the bank. I really did not think I was going to win [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2423.2400000000002s)]
*  to make or miss tournament. Great game. Here we go. This winner is going to the championship game. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2428.76s)]
*  So have you all ever played each other before? We sure have. What happened? I've been holding [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2434.2000000000003s)]
*  this L for three years. What happened, Frigga? He's a good one-on-one matchup. He's a schemer, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2438.36s)]
*  but now we got some different rules. This is the rematch three years in the making. This is huge. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2443.8s)]
*  I swear to God, I'm not that guy. If we run it back, it will not be like that. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2448.6000000000004s)]
*  I think I got Frigga winning because he doesn't want to lose twice. I think Cash so far. I'm going [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2455.32s)]
*  for Cash, the underdog. I like it. Oh, oh, that's a tough bucket, Cash. If he keeps that up, he will [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2461.8s)]
*  win this game. If he tries to do Flashy for all threes, he's going to... Set that. No, this is what I meant. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2468.92s)]
*  Frigga's a nonchalant hooper. Wow. Good speed. Very good. All right, one-one. Close game. Oh, good pump. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2475.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, he has it. Sets it back. That's perfect. Christopher London comments on the video, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2483.32s)]
*  you have to see it. To this day, I still have nightmares about what Hassan did to me. Oh no. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2488.36s)]
*  Perfect. Three, one. Cash isn't used to that kind of play. Most YouTubers do not hoop like Frigga. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2496.36s)]
*  I'm specifically speaking about two-high, Jesse. I lost to a 15-year-old. I got skunked to this guy. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2501.88s)]
*  Okay, I'm not that bad. No, I didn't think you're that bad, but I mean, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2507.4s)]
*  like your jumper sometimes looks like it hurts a little bit. Yeah. But it goes in. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2512.36s)]
*  Tough. Yeah, as opposed to his jumper. I love the string music. He just needs a three to take it. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2518.1200000000003s)]
*  I need to learn how to shoot. Oh. Okay, Cash didn't choppy. He got his one in. He can't do it again, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2523.8s)]
*  or it is a free throw. What you gonna do, Frigga? What you gonna do? What you gonna do? Oh, Cash is [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2530.6000000000004s)]
*  trying to get into his head. You see that? He's trying to get in his head. Oh, Frigga does not [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2536.2s)]
*  care. Nice. That is a free throw. Now, the fun fact here is no one even tried to warm up on [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2540.4399999999996s)]
*  the free throw. That is something I noticed, so he might still end up missing this. Trying to distract [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2545.56s)]
*  him. Doesn't matter. Six, one. What you want, Jesse? What would make for a good ending? Fadeaway three. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2550.7599999999998s)]
*  You let me know. Your shot is actually so just disgusting. Chris has to hide his face a little [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2555.72s)]
*  bit. Wait, what? Okay. Everybody calm down. I got copium from people who I ball with who also have [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2560.28s)]
*  appeared on book and squad videos already. Okay. The copium was, Oh, it's because your form doesn't [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2568.52s)]
*  look good that people that always assume that you're not going to make it. Okay. They go, Oh, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2575.4s)]
*  your shot is ugly. So people give you space. Except if we go back to the fucking footage, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2581.48s)]
*  two of the shots I made were directly contested by a man who is significantly taller than me. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2587.96s)]
*  Now I don't have a good shot. I know it and I do want to fix it. I mean, it's not, I wouldn't say [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2595.2400000000002s)]
*  it's as bad as like it says, it's like up there, you know, the Turkish Yokej exact. Yokej doesn't [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2600.92s)]
*  have the sexiest shot either. Why fix it? If it ain't broke, why fix it? If it ain't broke, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2606.76s)]
*  because it looks as dude, look, let's run it back. Let's run it back. It looked good. He had that [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2611.16s)]
*  one. My goodness. Oh, one dribble pole. Oh, look at that. Look at where I'm hitting that from. Like [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2616.6s)]
*  that's not an uncontested shot. Look at your lower half though. Yeah. I didn't establish good foot. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2624.8399999999997s)]
*  I didn't set my feet well because I was trying to get it up. Look frame by frame it. Let's run it [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2630.2799999999997s)]
*  back. Oh, funk ass jump shot. Look, one dribble plant, plant my foot and immediately go up. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2638.2s)]
*  Draymond with a backpack on. Look at that. The only problem is I don't flick it all the way. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2647.08s)]
*  See, it's not supposed to leave your hand here. It's supposed to leave your hand like that. And [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2652.04s)]
*  I don't, and I do need to, I do need to fix that. Former college player here. You have good form, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2657.56s)]
*  but needs to square up a little bit more with your feet and follow through. It just needs more to be [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2662.4399999999996s)]
*  towards the rim. You've made insane progress in the last year. The head doesn't move. And that's [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2665.96s)]
*  literally the thing most people struggle with is cool as fuck to have an ugly shot that always goes [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2670.6s)]
*  in. It's literally a flex. I don't want my shot is close to non-college player here. Jump shot is [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2675.2400000000002s)]
*  pretty good. My shot is close to being good. It's got the fixings of being a good shot. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2682.36s)]
*  My leg should be squared with the basket. That's wrong. But that was like, this is a contested shot [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2687.48s)]
*  that I was trying to, I was rushing into put up, look at how close it is. But the problem is I [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2694.04s)]
*  don't flick it enough. So the ball doesn't like the there is, you know, it rotates, but it doesn't [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2700.6s)]
*  rotate enough. Yeah. We high-fived after the shot. Your legs seem to be the biggest issue. A lot of [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2705.72s)]
*  times you start shooting when your body isn't facing the hoop. God, the crowd is stunned. We're all [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2711.32s)]
*  stunned. Right. Look at my last one too. Can Chris make the seven Oh, come back. Look at where I'm [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2718.12s)]
*  look at where I look at how I start this shot. Look at this. Look at that. Also, I don't want to [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2723.88s)]
*  fucking hear about from people that I'm not like, I don't want to hear from people that I don't have [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2730.2s)]
*  hops at all. Like that's, that's hop. That's hops. Just needs like that was hops. I'm not the [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2734.7599999999998s)]
*  bounciest person, but I got a little bit in me. It's just that because I'm so heavy, I don't have, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2743.48s)]
*  I don't stay up there for a while. So you never see it. You plant your feet well, which allows [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=2748.76s)]

*  leagues and shit like that. And if you get lucky, given my size advantage, you know, but most, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3421.4s)]
*  most chatters, most chatters will never ever, ever in a million years be able to play [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3428.92s)]
*  as the average, like even D three athletes. Oh, pull up. Hey, you see the thing about J [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3435.8s)]
*  Dub shot when he comes back here, bro, he is literally, you can't contest it. It's like, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3441.96s)]
*  he always fading. Oh, wow. Oh, the reverse reverse just short. That's a tough move. That is tough, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3446.2s)]
*  man. Also, this is one V one and one V one is a very different demon than five on five, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3451.8s)]
*  full court organized basketball. Like it's a, it's an entirely separate skill set. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3457.88s)]
*  Every possession matters. Facts silent in here. Oh, great. Two more threes would take it. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3465.8s)]
*  Did J Dub better keep the hand in pocket. Wow. Wow. Wow. He needed that. He needs some points [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3474.44s)]
*  right here. And one and one. He's flexing on him. He's flexing on him. Five. Oh, wow. Great defense. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3480.2000000000003s)]
*  Seven, seven. What a shot. How did he hit that? It's anybody's game. Anybody's game. Oh my goodness. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3492.36s)]
*  Who wants his money more? Who want it? Who want it? Oh, J Dub pulling another pull. Oh, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3500.04s)]
*  that was so close. That's a hard. That's that would have changed the entire plot here. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3505.16s)]
*  He had the opportunity to change it. Breaking shot. He takes it. He hits it. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3512.04s)]
*  This is insane. I cannot believe it. I feel like Frigga has to go for the three. He's so good at [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3519.56s)]
*  them. Yeah. Is this the next chapter of Frigga life? He goes to it. Oh my God. He hits it. What? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3524.28s)]
*  Ten, seven. How did the ball go? I have to do that's brave by the way. What he's doing right [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3532.2000000000003s)]
*  there is brave. That's a brave man. Okay. Going up against going up against J Dub like that [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3537.0s)]
*  when he's demonstrated his capacity to fucking posterize, but he, he still, he still gets it up [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3543.1600000000003s)]
*  there. How did the ball go? I have no idea. But one point separates Frigga from $10,000. Oh my God. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3549.4s)]
*  You could hear a pin drop. Would you have posted J Dub? No, no. J Dub is stronger than Chris. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3557.1600000000003s)]
*  I there's no way I can beat Chris either. I just got lucky. I'll never be able to beat him ever [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3561.64s)]
*  again. Frigga is a hoopist. No, Chris is big, but J Dub is definitely, I think J Dub is stronger. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3566.52s)]
*  I know this is so you got two way home. Frigga. You don't want that. You don't want that. Oh, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3572.6800000000003s)]
*  they're talking. They're talking. They're talking now. He's hungry. He got it. Frigga wins. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3576.92s)]
*  And Frigga takes it home. Are you not entertained? That was a great game. Congratulations. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3583.0s)]
*  I really do this y'all. Next chapter. Shout out to Jesser, man. Yo, Nas, I seen you win one of these. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3591.32s)]

*  stuff dog got cooked by an octogenarian Omega low. Oh, I wonder if I could, cause I said 1948. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3644.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Uh, 1948, they thought it was a reference to the knock bar or something. And they probably [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYiltc6Hnfs&t=3654.04s)]
