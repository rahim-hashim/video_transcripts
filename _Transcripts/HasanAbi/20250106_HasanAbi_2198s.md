# Jensen Huang’s CES 2025 Speech Was Absolutely Crazy | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw)
*  then I feel like everything he's explaining is like, we are clubbing baby seals with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=0.0s)]
*  shield that is in my hand in order to generate enough power to, to fire up the engines in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=4.84s)]
*  the server room to do the AI training necessary to upscale the performance of a shittier chip [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=13.08s)]
*  that will give you 40 90 equivalent performance through the AI training. The amount of baby [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=21.2s)]
*  seals I am clubbing is unimaginable. Disco lights in here. I have lit the rainforest on fire. Do [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  not go there. They are done. They're dead. The size of the wafer. But this doesn't include the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=35.28s)]
*  impact of yield. It would have to be probably three or four times the size. But what we base [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=41.4s)]
*  why would I watch another streamer with 81 viewers reacting to the Nvidia keynote instead of just [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=50.72s)]
*  straight up sending me the Nvidia keynote? No CDG for me. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=56.52s)]
*  Hi, Emma. We're going to take a sample today. Okay. What is the video? You know, I'm gonna be here [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=65.16s)]
*  the whole time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=69.84s)]
*  They bring meaning to numbers [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=73.84s)]
*  to help us better understand the world around us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=77.48s)]
*  What? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  predict the dangers that surround us [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=88.32s)]
*  and find cures [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  what is going on? Why are they doing? Are they doing AI hype? What is this is just AI slop? God, I [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=99.72s)]
*  hate everyone. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=107.16s)]
*  AI is gonna solve the world's problems. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  And restore what we've lost. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=116.64s)]
*  Zachary, I got my voice back, buddy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=122.44s)]
*  They help us move forward. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  One small step at a time. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=132.96s)]
*  And one giant leap. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=141.32s)]
*  Together. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=144.64s)]
*  Nvidia is an AI company. Now, I'm just waiting for the bubble to burst. It doesn't matter. Nvidia [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  is everything company. When will you not? When? When will you understand? Nvidia is everything [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=151.52s)]
*  company? They literally say whatever the new trend is, because that's what the market responds [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=157.84s)]
*  positively to. They were also a blockchain company. They were also a cryptocurrency blockchain [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  company when that was what was popping. Are they still a blockchain company? No, I don't think so. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  But it doesn't matter. They said it at the time. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=173.36s)]
*  Jensen Wong just put the 5090 in the bag little bro. I don't care about any of this other stuff. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=177.16s)]
*  This is all for the birds. Okay. All of the AI and the blockchain and whatever the everything app [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=183.0s)]
*  whatever whatever they're saying is just for institutional investors to go all pog. They said [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  the right words from Gary Shapiro. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=196.36s)]
*  I'm in Las Vegas after all. If this doesn't work out, if all of you object, well just get used to it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=198.84s)]
*  I think I really think you have to let this sink in. In another hour or so you're going to feel good about it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=209.4s)]
*  Well, welcome to Nvidia. In fact, you're inside Nvidia's digital twin. And we're going to take you to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=216.64s)]
*  Nvidia. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nvidia. You're inside our digital twin. Everything here is [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=227.32s)]
*  Everything here is generated by AI. It has been an extraordinary journey, extraordinary year. And it started in 1993. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=242.16s)]
*  Ready, go! With NV1. We wanted to build computers that can do things that normal computers couldn't. And NV1 [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=257.04s)]
*  made it possible to have a game console on the jacket is as our programming architecture was called UDA. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  Missing the letter C until a little while later. But UDA, unified device architecture and the first developer for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  UDA and the first application that I've worked on UDA was Sega's virtual fighter. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  So was it, it might be Phil apply. Oh my God. Is he an international programmer? Or maybe he's a cryptocurrency [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=293.76s)]
*  bro. I guess that's why 20 Bitcoin mining, 20 plus years of incredible advance in this incredible processor [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=302.36s)]
*  called the GPU. It made modern computer graphics possible. And now 30 years later, Sega's virtual fighter is [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=310.88s)]
*  completely cinematic. This is the new virtual fighter project that's coming. I just can't wait. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=322.0s)]
*  Bro made it seem like this is what it would look like in 1999. Come on dog. Six years after 1999. We [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=330.28s)]
*  invented CUDA so that we could explain or express the programmability of our GPUs to a rich set of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=337.88s)]
*  algorithms I could benefit from it. CUDA initially was difficult to explain. And it took years in fact, it [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=347.4s)]
*  took approximately six years. Somehow, six years later, six years later or so. 2012. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=355.88s)]
*  Bro, the 4090 is so big, it just ruins like there's no it eliminates half the slots in my motherboard. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  To process Alex net and the rest of by that standard, the 5090 is just going to need an entirely new one [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=376.32000000000005s)]
*  incredible patients started with 5090s bigger, stop can understand images and words and sounds to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=383.12s)]
*  generative AI. We can generate images and it's going to be like this bit it's going to be going to need its [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=391.72s)]
*  own power supply. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=398.8s)]
*  AIs that can perceive, reason, plan and act. And then the next phase, some of which we'll talk about [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=400.12s)]
*  tonight, physical AI 2012. Now magically, 2018, something happened that was pretty incredible. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=407.72s)]
*  Google's transformer was released as BERT and the world of AI really took off. Transformers, as you [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  know, completely changed the landscape for artificial intelligence. In fact, it completely changed [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=430.12s)]
*  the landscape for computing altogether. We recognize properly that AI was not just a new application [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=436.32s)]
*  with a new business opportunity. More importantly, machine learning. Yeah, right. By [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=445.12s)]
*  Transformers was going to fundamentally change how computing works. And today, computing is [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=452.12s)]
*  revolutionized in every single layer from hand coding, instructions that run on CPUs to create [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=461.12s)]
*  software tools that humans use. We now have machine learning that creates and optimizes neural [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=469.72s)]
*  networks that processes on GPUs and creates artificial intelligence. Every single layer of the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=476.52000000000004s)]
*  technology stack has been completely changed. An incredible transformation. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=484.12s)]
*  You're being a hater. Contrary to the Reddit kind. I just I hate AI so much. I hate it. I hate it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=489.92s)]
*  I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. Just about any modality. Surely you've seen text and images and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=495.12s)]
*  sounds and things like that. But not only can we understand those, we can understand amino acids. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=501.72s)]
*  We can understand physics. We understand them. We can translate them and generate them. The [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=507.52s)]
*  applications are just completely endless. In fact, almost any AI application that you see out [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=513.92s)]
*  there, what modality is the input that it learned from? What modality of information did it [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=519.92s)]
*  translate to? And what modality of information is it generating? If you ask these three fundamental [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=526.52s)]
*  questions, just about every single application could be inferred. And so when you see application [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=532.12s)]
*  after applications that are AI driven, AI native, at the core of it, this fundamental concept is [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=538.92s)]
*  there. Machine learning has changed how every application is going to be built, how computing [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=546.22s)]
*  will be done, and the possibilities beyond. Well, GPUs, G-Force, in a lot of ways, all of this [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=552.4200000000001s)]
*  with AI is the house that G-Force built. G-Force enabled AI to reach the masses. And now AI is [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=564.4200000000001s)]
*  coming home to G-Force. There are so many things that you can't do without AI. Let me show you [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=573.62s)]
*  some of it now. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=581.02s)]
*  What is this? Personally, I read a bunch of classics in high register in college. I guess it was [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=583.02s)]
*  fun. Recently, I chatted with Aristotle in the readable English, finished around 5x as fast as the translation. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=607.82s)]
*  I felt like other main gist of things. I don't know, does it actually teach much? What? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=613.62s)]
*  Okay, this looks awesome. Okay, I'm backing on the AI train. That guy sucks. Aristotle chat GPT nonsense, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=622.62s)]
*  but this is sick. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=630.62s)]
*  So AI makes it less costly on the computer. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=631.62s)]
*  Is that what it is? Like, I'm too stupid to understand chat. Some of you nerds need to explain this to me. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=661.62s)]
*  I guess DLS, I mean DLS is cool. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=674.62s)]
*  What is cool? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=676.62s)]
*  Was real-time computer graphics. No computer graphics researcher, no computer scientist would have told you that it is possible for us to ray trace every single pixel at this point. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=677.62s)]
*  Ray tracing is a simulation of light. The amount of geometry that you saw was absolutely insane. It would have been impossible without artificial intelligence. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=697.62s)]
*  There are two fundamental things that we did. We used, of course, programmable shading and ray traced acceleration to produce incredibly beautiful pixels. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=707.62s)]
*  But then we have artificial intelligence be conditioned, be controlled by that pixel to generate a whole bunch of other pixels. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=717.62s)]
*  Not only is it able to generate other pixels spatially because it's aware of what the colors should be, it has been trained on a supercomputer back in Nvidia. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=728.62s)]
*  And so the neural network that's running on the GPU can infer and predict the pixels that we did not render. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=738.62s)]
*  Not only can we do that, it's called DLSS. The latest generation of DLSS also generates beyond frames. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=746.62s)]
*  It can predict the future, generating three additional frames for every frame that we calculate. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=755.62s)]
*  What you saw, if we just said four frames of what you saw, because we're going to render one frame and generate three, if I said four frames at full HD, 4K, that's 33 million pixels or so. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=762.62s)]
*  Out of that 33 million pixels, we computed only two. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=775.62s)]
*  It is an absolute miracle that we can computationally using programmable shaders and our ray traced engine, ray tracing engine to compute 2 million pixels and have AI predict all of the other. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=782.62s)]
*  I saw the leak video of engaged sex with Dre. Oh no, it's out, dude. That's crazy. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=798.62s)]
*  What is wrong with these chatters, bro? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=803.62s)]
*  AI does a lot less computation. It takes, of course, an enormous amount of training to produce that. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=806.62s)]
*  But once you train it, the generation is extremely efficient. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=813.62s)]
*  So this is one of the incredible capabilities of artificial intelligence. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=817.62s)]
*  And that's why there's so many amazing things that are happening. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=821.62s)]
*  We used G-Force to enable artificial intelligence, and now artificial intelligence is revolutionizing G-Force. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=825.62s)]
*  Everyone today, we're announcing our next generation, the RTX Blackwell family. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=832.62s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=840.62s)]
*  Isn't the AI predictor still like off though? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=855.62s)]
*  Like, how can it be 100% accurate if it's like filling the gaps? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=861.62s)]
*  Chatters are also complaining that it's going to make games less optimized because a lot of big developers will pay programmers less, hoping that Nvidia picks up the slack with its AI. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=866.62s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=878.62s)]
*  Our brand new G-Force RTX 50 series. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=902.62s)]
*  That looks smaller than the 4090. What the hell? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=908.62s)]
*  The GPU is just a beast. 92 billion transistors, 4,000 tops, four petaflops of AI, three times higher than the last generation, Ada. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=911.62s)]
*  And we need all of it to generate those pixels that I showed you. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=925.62s)]
*  380 ray tracing teraflops so that we could, for the pixels that we have to compute, compute the most beautiful image you possibly can. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=929.62s)]
*  92 billion magoos. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=938.62s)]
*  And of course, 125 shader teraflops. There's actually a concurrent shader teraflops as well as an integer unit of equal performance. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=939.62s)]
*  So two dual shaders. One is for floating point. One is for integer. G7 memory from Micron. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=948.62s)]
*  1.8 terabytes per second, twice the performance of our last generation. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=957.62s)]
*  And we now have the ability to intermix AI workloads with computer graphics workloads. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=961.62s)]
*  And one of the amazing things about this generation is the Founders Edition. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=968.62s)]
*  You have a third party 4080 with an extra fan. I thought I had a 4090. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=972.62s)]
*  So the shader is able to carry these neural networks. I have a 4080. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=977.62s)]
*  And as a result, we invented neural texture compression and neural material shading. Oh, I have a 4090. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=981.62s)]
*  As a result of that, you get these amazingly beautiful images that are only possible because we use AIs to learn the texture, learn the compression algorithm, and as a result, get extraordinary results. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=987.62s)]
*  OK, so this is the brand new RTX Blackwell 5090. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=999.62s)]
*  Now, even the mechanical design is a miracle. Look at this. It's got two fans. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1012.62s)]
*  This whole graphics card is just one giant fan. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1020.62s)]
*  You know, so the question is, where's the graphics card? Is it literally this big? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1024.62s)]
*  The voltage regulator design is state of the art. Incredible design. The engineering team did a great job. So here it is. Thank you. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1028.62s)]
*  OK, so those are the speeds and feeds. So how does it compare? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1043.62s)]
*  OK, well, this is RTX 4090. I know. I know many of you have one. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1047.62s)]
*  I know it. Look, it's $1,599. It is one of the best investments you could possibly make. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1060.62s)]
*  $3,000. You bring it home. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1066.62s)]
*  Three racks, three racks, three racks, three racks. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1071.62s)]
*  PC Entertainment Command Center. Isn't that right? Don't tell me that's not true. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1074.62s)]
*  Don't be ashamed. It's liquid cooled. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1080.62s)]
*  Fancy lights all over it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1085.62s)]
*  You lock it when you leave. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1089.62s)]
*  You lock it when you leave. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1090.62s)]
*  It's the modern home theater. It makes perfect sense. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1094.62s)]
*  And now for $1,500 and $1,599, you get to upgrade that and turbo charge the living daylights out of it. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1097.62s)]
*  Well, now with the Blackwell family, RTX 5070, 4090 performance at $549. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1104.62s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1113.62s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1117.62s)]
*  Impossible without artificial intelligence. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1121.62s)]
*  Impossible without the four tops, four tera ops of AI tensor cores. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1123.62s)]
*  Impossible without the G7 memories. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1131.62s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1134.62s)]
*  So, 5070, 4090 performance, $549, and here's the whole family. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1135.62s)]
*  Starting from 5070 all the way up to 5090. 5090, twice the performance of a 4090. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1140.62s)]
*  Starting, of course, we're producing a very large scale availability starting January. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1147.62s)]
*  Well, it is incredible, but we managed to put these gigantic performance GPUs into a laptop. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1156.62s)]
*  This is a 5070 laptop. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1166.62s)]
*  For $1,299, this 5070 laptop has a 4090 performance. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1169.62s)]
*  Scam 4090L, I mean, I don't really care. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1177.62s)]
*  This is a, look at this thing. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1180.62s)]
*  Here, let me, here. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1182.62s)]
*  There's only so many pockets. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1184.62s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Jeanine Paul. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1187.62s)]
*  So can you imagine? You got this incredible graphics card here, Blackwell. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1194.62s)]
*  We're going to shrink it and put it in there. Does that make any sense? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1198.62s)]
*  They're saying with frame-jet and bullshit it's comparable to a 4090? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1203.62s)]
*  That is because we're generating most of the pixels using our tensor cores. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1207.62s)]
*  So we ray-trace only the pixels we need, and we generate using artificial intelligence all the other pixels we have. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1212.62s)]
*  As a result, the amount of, the energy efficiency is just off the charts. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1219.62s)]
*  The future of computer graphics is neural rendering, the fusion of artificial intelligence and computer graphics. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1223.62s)]
*  And what's really amazing is, oh, here we go. Thank you. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1230.62s)]
*  This is a surprisingly kinetic keynote. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1237.62s)]
*  4090 worth $500 now? Yo, calm down, chatters. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1241.62s)]
*  And so the 5090, the 5090 will fit into a laptop, a thin laptop. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1246.62s)]
*  That last laptop was 14, 14.9 millimeters. You got a 5080, 5070Ti. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1252.62s)]
*  Wait till the reviews come out and they actually test the performance of these cards, okay? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1257.62s)]
*  And match it up against the real power of a 4090. They said a 4090 equivalent. Okay? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1262.62s)]
*  Something about this smells a bit fishy to me, but I am also a Luddite, so I don't know. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1269.62s)]
*  Well, G-Force brought AI to the world, democratized AI. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1274.62s)]
*  Now AI has come back and revolutionized G-Force. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1280.62s)]
*  Let's talk about artificial intelligence. Let's go to somewhere else at Nvidia. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1284.62s)]
*  Yeah, they democratized it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1289.62s)]
*  This is literally our office. This is literally Nvidia's headquarters. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1294.62s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk about AI. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1300.62s)]
*  The industry is chasing and racing to scale artificial intelligence. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1303.62s)]
*  And the scaling law is a powerful model. It's an empirical law that has been observed. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1313.62s)]
*  Is what they're doing even AI or is he just simply slapping on the sticker of AI to make it more app-appeasing to investors? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1319.62s)]
*  The more data you have, the training data that you have, the larger modeling you have. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1330.62s)]
*  Like as far as like frame generation. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1333.62s)]
*  And the more compute that you apply to it, therefore, the more effective or the more capable your model will become. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1335.62s)]
*  And so the scaling law continues. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1344.62s)]
*  What's really amazing is that now we're moving towards, of course, and the internet is producing about twice the amount of data every single year as it did last year. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1347.62s)]
*  I think in the next couple of years, humanity will produce more data than all of humanity has ever produced since the beginning. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1357.62s)]
*  And so we're still producing a gigantic amount of data and it's becoming multimodal. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1366.62s)]
*  Video and images and sound, all of that data could be used to train the fundamental knowledge, the foundational knowledge of an AI. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1372.62s)]
*  But there are, in fact, two other scaling laws that has now emerged and it's somewhat intuitive. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1381.62s)]
*  The second scaling law is post training scaling law. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1389.62s)]
*  Post training scaling law uses technology techniques like reinforcement learning, human feedback. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1393.62s)]
*  Basically, the AI produces and generates answers based on a human query. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1399.62s)]
*  The human then, of course, gives a feedback. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1406.62s)]
*  It's much more complicated than that, but that reinforcement learning system with a fair number of very high quality prompts causes the AI to refine its skills. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1409.62s)]
*  It could fine tune its skills for particular domains. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1420.62s)]
*  It could be better at solving math problems, better at reasoning, so on and so forth. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1423.62s)]
*  And so it's essentially like having a mentor or having a coach give you feedback after you're done going to school. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1428.62s)]
*  And so you get tests, you get feedback, you improve yourself. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1437.62s)]
*  We also have reinforcement learning AI feedback and we have synthetic data generation. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1441.62s)]
*  These techniques are rather akin to, if you will, self-practice. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1447.62s)]
*  You know the answer to a particular problem and you continue to try it until you get it right. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1454.62s)]
*  And so an AI could be presented with a very complicated and difficult problem that is verifiable functionally and has an answer that we understand. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1461.62s)]
*  Maybe proving a theorem, maybe solving a geometry problem. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1471.62s)]
*  And so these problems would cause the AI to produce answers and using reinforcement learning, you would learn how to improve itself. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1476.62s)]
*  That's called post training. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1485.62s)]
*  Post training requires an enormous amount of computation, but the end result produces incredible models. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1487.62s)]
*  We now have a third scaling law and this third scaling law has to do with what's called test time scaling. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1494.62s)]
*  Test time scaling is basically when you're being used, when you're using the AI. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1502.62s)]
*  The AI has the ability to now apply a different resource allocation. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1508.62s)]
*  Instead of improving its parameters, now it's focused on deciding how much computation. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1513.62s)]
*  I got no idea what the hell he's talking about. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1519.62s)]
*  It wants to produce reasoning as a way of thinking about this. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1522.62s)]
*  This is some crazy nerd shit, man. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1526.62s)]
*  Is this instead of a, are the Marvel rivals cinematic is going to look sexy or not? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1528.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1534.62s)]
*  Explain to me that Mr. Crocodile jacket, man. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1535.62s)]
*  Your AI system would evaluate which one of the ideas that you generated was the best one. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1539.62s)]
*  Maybe it solves the problem step by step, so on and so forth. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1545.62s)]
*  And so now test time scaling has proven to be incredibly effective. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1548.62s)]
*  You're watching this sequence of technology and all of these scaling laws emerge as we see incredible achievements from chat GPT to 01 to 03. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1553.62s)]
*  And now Gemini Pro with the 59 in the bag, bro, are going through this journey step by step by step of pre-training to post-training to test time scaling. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1566.62s)]
*  Well, the amount of computation that we need, of course, is incredible. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1577.62s)]
*  Yeah. I need to know what level of computation is needed to upscale. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1581.62s)]
*  Okay. The new fantastic for ladies bosom. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1586.62s)]
*  That's what I need. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1591.62s)]
*  My artificial intelligence, the most valuable asset that we have, and it can be applied to solve a lot of very challenging problems. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1592.62s)]
*  That is the most significant computational problem. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1598.62s)]
*  I need to know what silo looks like. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1600.62s)]
*  Computing is driving an enormous demand for this incredible chip. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1603.62s)]
*  We call black well, let's take a look at black well, well, black well is in full production. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1607.62s)]
*  It is incredible what it looks like. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1617.62s)]
*  So first of all, there's some every every single cloud service. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1619.62s)]
*  How am I looking at systems up and running? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1624.62s)]
*  We have systems here from about 15, 15, 15, excuse me, 15 computer makers. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1626.62s)]
*  It's being made about 200 different skews, 200 different configurations. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1634.62s)]
*  They're liquid 86 and video gray CPU versions and be link 36 by two and be links 72 by one whole bunch of different types of systems so that we can accommodate just about every single data center in the world. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1639.62s)]
*  Well, this these systems are being currently manufactured in some 45 factories. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1653.62s)]
*  It tells you how pervasive artificial intelligence is and how much the industry is jumping onto artificial intelligence in this new computing model. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1660.62s)]
*  Well, the reason why we're driving it so hard is because we need a lot more computation and it's very clear. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1670.62s)]
*  It's very clear that that. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1678.62s)]
*  Janine. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1684.62s)]
*  You know, I. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1691.62s)]
*  Oh, it's hard to tell. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1694.62s)]
*  You don't ever want to reach your hands into a dark place. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1696.62s)]
*  Is this a good idea? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1701.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1705.62s)]
*  Why are they clapping? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1709.62s)]
*  Dude, nerds are so funny. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1711.62s)]
*  What is happening for it? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1722.62s)]
*  Wait for it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1726.62s)]
*  He's explaining how to get better performance out of your AI through training and how to do all the training. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1728.62s)]
*  There are orders of magnitudes and more GPUs needed to do all the training. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1732.62s)]
*  I think I was worthy. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1735.62s)]
*  So you need to buy a stock. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1737.62s)]
*  This is my show and tell is a show and tell. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1740.62s)]
*  So this envy link system, this right here, this envy link system. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1743.62s)]
*  This is GB 200 envy link 72. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1748.62s)]
*  Bro, not gonna lie. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1752.62s)]
*  We need to bully nerds more. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1753.62s)]
*  I think 600000 parts. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1755.62s)]
*  It's gotten out of control. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1757.62s)]
*  I think it's the opposite of a vague train where I think like we need a society that venerates the jocks and bullies the nerds more. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1759.62s)]
*  What's. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1765.62s)]
*  It has a spine behind it that connects all of these GPU together. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1769.62s)]
*  Two miles of copper cable. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1775.62s)]
*  5000 cables. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1780.62s)]
*  This is being manufactured in 45 factories around the world. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1783.62s)]
*  We liquid cool. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1787.62s)]
*  You'd be bullies. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1789.62s)]
*  Who's going to bully me or Bjornson to the data centers because I love when chatters are like you'd be bullied to bitch. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1790.62s)]
*  I'm six four two thirty. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1797.62s)]
*  The manufacturing is insane. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1800.62s)]
*  But the goal of all of this is because the scaling laws are there is a limited there's a limited number of people on the planet. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1802.62s)]
*  They can do that to me over our last generation improves the performance per watt by a factor of four. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1809.62s)]
*  OK, I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1816.62s)]
*  If you don't like it and don't understand why I watch it or shut up performance per dollar. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1817.62s)]
*  I'm enjoying a factor of three. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1820.62s)]
*  That's basically says that in one generation we reduce the cost of training these models by a factor of three. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1822.62s)]
*  Or if you want to increase the size of your model by a factor of three, it's about the same cost. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1831.62s)]
*  But the important thing is this. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1836.62s)]
*  These are generating tokens that are being used by all of us when we use chat GPT or when we use Gemini use our phones in the future. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1838.62s)]
*  Just about all of these applications are going to be consuming these tokens and these tokens are being generated by these systems. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1846.62s)]
*  And every single data center is limited by power. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1854.62s)]
*  And so if the per watt of Blackwell is four times. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1858.62s)]
*  Our last generation. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1864.62s)]
*  Then I feel like everything he's explaining is like we are clubbing baby seals with the shield that is in my hand in order to generate enough power to to fire up the engines in the server room to do the AI training necessary to upscale the performance of a shittier chip. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1866.62s)]
*  That will give you 40 90 equivalent performance through the AI training. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1887.62s)]
*  The amount of baby seals I am clubbing is unimaginable. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1893.62s)]
*  Disco lights in here. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1897.62s)]
*  I have lit the rainforest on fire. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1899.62s)]
*  Do not go there. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1901.62s)]
*  They are done. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1903.62s)]
*  They're dead. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1904.62s)]
*  The size of the wafer. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1905.62s)]
*  But this doesn't include the impact of yield. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1906.62s)]
*  It would have to be probably three or four times the size. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1909.62s)]
*  But what we basically have here is 72 black shield erased for Pacific Islands. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1911.62s)]
*  The coral reefs are no more. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1917.62s)]
*  I have used this shield to eradicate them. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1919.62s)]
*  Super computer fastest supercomputer only recently. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1922.62s)]
*  This entire room supercomputer only recently. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1925.62s)]
*  And to be fair, it's worth it. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1928.62s)]
*  If I could see bouncer your titties in my video games like low key. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1930.62s)]
*  No matter how hard Naughty Dog tries to make them unfappable. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1933.62s)]
*  I will fap to them. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1938.62s)]
*  The bandwidth is 1.2 petabytes per second. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1939.62s)]
*  That's basically the entire internet traffic that's happening right now. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1942.62s)]
*  The entire world's internet traffic is being processed across these chips. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1950.62s)]
*  And we have 130 trillion transistors in total. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1957.62s)]
*  2,592 CPU cores. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1963.62s)]
*  Whole bunch of networking. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1967.62s)]
*  And so these... [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1969.62s)]
*  Yeah, petabytes. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1971.62s)]
*  It's for Dr. Dursz-Dusk. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1972.62s)]
*  Blackwells. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1973.62s)]
*  These are our ConnectX networking chips. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1975.62s)]
*  These are the NVLink. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1981.62s)]
*  And we're trying to pretend about the NVLink spine, but that's not possible. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1983.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1988.62s)]
*  And these are all of the HBM memories. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1989.62s)]
*  12, 14 terabytes of HBM memory. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1992.62s)]
*  This is what we're trying to do. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1995.62s)]
*  And this is the miracle. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1997.62s)]
*  This is the miracle of the Blackwell system. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=1998.62s)]
*  The Blackwell dies right here. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2000.62s)]
*  You should learn how to code. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2002.62s)]
*  Okay, dude. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2004.62s)]
*  Just put the door dash in the bag. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2005.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2007.62s)]
*  In addition to that. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2008.62s)]
*  Learn the code. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2010.62s)]
*  They told you to learn the code. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2011.62s)]
*  Now everyone who learned the code is door dashing. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2013.62s)]
*  This literally eviscerated the industry. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2015.62s)]
*  Things like this. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2019.62s)]
*  Is there a chair I could sit down for a second? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2021.62s)]
*  It's messed up. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2025.62s)]
*  Just put the chips in the bag, buddy. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2031.62s)]
*  I thought he said there's no coders. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2033.62s)]
*  Yeah, the AI. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2035.62s)]
*  Can I have a Micolob Ultra? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2036.62s)]
*  AI sounds gonna take over a little, bro. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2040.62s)]
*  Great. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2042.62s)]
*  What? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2045.62s)]
*  A Micolob Ultra? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2046.62s)]
*  How is it possible? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2048.62s)]
*  That we're in the Micolob Ultra stadium. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2050.62s)]
*  It's like coming to Nvidia and we don't have a GPU for you. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2056.62s)]
*  So we need an enormous amount of computation [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2064.62s)]
*  because we want to train larger and larger models. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2067.62s)]
*  And these inferences, these inferences used to be one inference. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2069.62s)]
*  But in the future, the AI is going to be talking to itself. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2074.62s)]
*  It's going to be thinking. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2076.62s)]
*  It's going to be internally reflecting processing. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2078.62s)]
*  So today the person giving him the person giving him the water is a former coder [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2080.62s)]
*  who now has to work at the Micolob Ultra stadium, fetching his water. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2086.62s)]
*  Cause the AI displaced their job. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2091.62s)]
*  GPT01, you know, with, with the new, the pre Gemini Pro and the new GP, the, the 0 1 0 3 models, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2094.62s)]
*  they're talking to themselves. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2101.62s)]
*  We reflecting their thinking. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2103.62s)]
*  And so as you could imagine, the rate at which the tokens could be ingested is incredibly high. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2105.62s)]
*  And so we need the token rates, the token generation rates to go way up. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2111.62s)]
*  And we also have to drive the cost way down simultaneously so that the cost, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2115.62s)]
*  the quality of service can be extraordinary. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2120.62s)]
*  The cost to customers can continue to be low and AI will continue to scale. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2122.62s)]
*  And so that's the fundamental purpose. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2127.62s)]
*  The reason why we created MVLink. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2129.62s)]
*  Well, one of the most important things that's happening in the world of enterprise is a gentai. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2131.62s)]
*  A gentai AI basically is a perfect example of test time scaling. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2136.62s)]
*  It's a, AI is a system of models. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2141.62s)]
*  Some of it is understanding, interacting with the customer, interacting with the user. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2144.62s)]
*  Some of it is maybe retrieving information, retrieving information from storage, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2148.62s)]
*  a semantic AI system like a rag. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2153.62s)]
*  Maybe it's going on to the internet. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2156.62s)]
*  Maybe it's studying a PDF file. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2158.62s)]
*  And so it might be using tools. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2161.62s)]
*  It might be using a calculator. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2163.62s)]
*  Studying Dr. Duses-Beg. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2164.62s)]
*  And it might be using a generative AI to generate charts and such. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2165.62s)]
*  And it's iterating. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2169.62s)]
*  It's taking the problem you gave it, breaking it down step by step, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2170.62s)]
*  and it's iterating through all these different models. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2173.62s)]
*  Well, in order to respond to a customer in the future, in order for AI to respond, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2175.62s)]
*  it used to be ask a question, answer starts spewing out. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2180.62s)]
*  In the future, you ask a question, a whole bunch of models are going to be working in the background. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2183.62s)]
*  Pause the track, I've melted. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2187.62s)]
*  And so, it's time scaling. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2189.62s)]
*  The amount of computation used for... [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSvUE7ldhw&t=2191.62s)]
