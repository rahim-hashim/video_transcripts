# Arab Americans React To Trump's Gaza Redevelopment Plan | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4)
*  And Trump doesn't care about polls anymore. And why would he [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=0.0s)]
*  he has no more elections and doesn't care about the GOP. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=2.72s)]
*  Hitler was also an anti war candidate. A lot of policies [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  were initially unpopular. No Trump cares about popularity. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=6.48s)]
*  You're wrong about that. I think he is he for selfish reasons [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=12.24s)]
*  for narcissistic reasons, but reasons nonetheless, Donald [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=17.76s)]
*  Trump absolutely cares about being popular. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=21.54s)]
*  All right, let's get back to Arab Americans in Michigan react to President Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=24.48s)]
*  United States community, which helped Trump carry the critical swing state. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=33.6s)]
*  He won 42% of the vote in Dearborn versus vice president Harris with 36% and Jill Stein with 18. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=37.84s)]
*  In 2020, Biden handily carried the city with 69%. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=45.44s)]
*  Fay Nimmer voted for Trump in 2024 out of frustration. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=50.08s)]
*  Administration supportive Israel. Now she is troubled by the president's proposal [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=55.04s)]
*  to move Palestinians out of Gaza. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's very concerning and it's inferior rating. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=62.64s)]
*  Personal feelings. You're infuriated, but standing by your decision for now to have voted for Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=72.64s)]
*  And what would move that needle for you to say, you know what, I made a mistake. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=73.52s)]
*  Palestine is the red line for this community. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  Nimmer says she suspects Trump is bluffing and is using his proposal [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=80.48s)]
*  as some sort of negotiating tactic. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=85.28s)]
*  That's the same sentiment shared by Amar's are first. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=87.76s)]
*  This is clearly not going to happen, right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=91.2s)]
*  And real estate broker Ali Al Farajala. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people are calling me and texting me saying, hey, you know, how, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=96.48s)]
*  how did your vote work out? You know, how is that third party vote? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=100.48s)]
*  Both were so-called protest voters, neither supported Trump or Harris. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=103.52s)]
*  Are there any sort of second thoughts now about having supported a third party candidate? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=108.64s)]
*  Absolutely not. And I'll still do it again and again and again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=113.28s)]
*  I didn't vote for Trump. So a protest vote, I don't know. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=116.32s)]
*  I would say it was a targeted vote of conscience to say that the children of Gaza have to mean [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=120.16s)]
*  something. Their death has to mean something. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=127.84s)]
*  And while Arab Americans here were divided in the past going forward, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=131.12s)]
*  one point is uniting them. Opposition to Trump's proposal to move Palestinians out of Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=135.36s)]
*  The community will be unified. I will tell you this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=142.16s)]
*  The Palestinian people would rather die and live in a demolition site than to be ethnically [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=145.36s)]
*  clipped and being sent out of Gaza to Egypt or Jordan. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  So again, Anderson, after spending some time here in the Arab American community, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=156.4s)]
*  you really get a sense that they feel like they've been let down by both Republicans [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=162.96s)]
*  and Democrats. Certainly there's a great deal of frustration. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=167.6s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder why. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=170.88s)]
*  After hearing what Trump is proposing. But there's also a feeling that had Harris been elected, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=171.6s)]
*  had it been a Harris administration, the feeling here is that Palestinians would still be suffering. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=177.52s)]
*  Anderson? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=184.56s)]
*  Carol, thanks very much. And you're born with me now. Put some numbers to the story. CNN [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=185.36s)]
*  senior data reporter Harry Inton. Generally speaking, has there been much an appetite in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=188.72s)]
*  the US to get involved in rebuilding Gaza? No, there has not been. Look, we have no new [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  polling since last night. Polling works fast. It doesn't work that fast. But in the polling [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=199.44s)]
*  that we had prior that was taken towards the middle end of last year, what we saw was the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=203.44s)]
*  overwhelming majority of Americans opposed the idea that the United States should take a lead role [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=208.32s)]
*  in reconstructing Gaza. You can see it right there. 57% opposed, just 37% support. And what [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=213.04s)]
*  I should note is the support was lowest among Trump's own base of Republicans. So the idea that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  this is going to sell among the American people at large or the Republican base simply put he [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=224.0s)]
*  definitely wasn't looking at the polls before he went out there and made a statement that was heard [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  around the world because of how crazy it sounded to most people. How did Palestinians view President [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump during his first administration? Yeah, so like, you know, we talk about Americans, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=235.44s)]
*  right? But at the end of the day, the Gaza Strip is filled with Palestinians, right? So the question [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=239.04s)]
*  is how did Palestinians feel about Donald Trump during his first term? And the bottom line is they [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=242.96s)]
*  absolutely disapproved of his leadership. I mean, you rarely see numbers like this. Look at this, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=248.56s)]
*  78% during his first term disapproved of his leadership, just 10% approve it. And I even [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=254.16s)]
*  drilled down a little bit more because you know, I love going into those cross tabs. And what I found [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=260.48s)]
*  was approval or at least disapproval among Gazans was even higher. The disapproval among Gazans was [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=264.0s)]
*  in my opinion, we owe it to the Palestinians to pay for rebuilding Palestine to the last penny. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=269.2s)]
*  I agree. Except Trump doesn't want to rebuild Palestine. He wants to ethnically displace it [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=272.48s)]
*  first and then build condominiums on what is the Gaza Strip. It's the worst of both worlds. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=277.12s)]
*  Even higher than it was among Palestinians overall. So simply put, this would not be a [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=284.0s)]
*  popular plan either in America or in the Palestinian territories. We are finally putting America first. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=287.36s)]
*  Huh. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=295.92s)]
*  Our policy of never. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=298.16s)]
*  Totally. I love putting America first. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=300.32s)]
*  Ending war, regime change and nation building is being replaced by the clear eyed pursuit [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=303.12s)]
*  of American interest. We do not seek nation building. We're going to end the era of nation building. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=310.8s)]
*  A disastrous concept, a disastrous era. Why are we nation building over there? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=318.64s)]
*  We want a nation build over here. When President Donald Trump first entered politics nearly a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=325.44s)]
*  decade ago, he did so with promises of putting an end to nation building and removing the U.S. from [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  foreign entanglements in the Middle East. But now he's of course said that he has a new plan to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=336.32s)]
*  redevelop the Gaza Strip. Or as his secretary of state Marco Rubio put it, quote, make Gaza [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=341.84s)]
*  beautiful again. Rubio clarifying some of the details of the president's proposal yesterday. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=348.0s)]
*  The only thing President Trump has done very generously in my view is offer the United States [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  willingness to step in, clear the debris, clean the place up. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=360.32s)]
*  As the Israel's defense minister readies its military for the quote, voluntary departure, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=365.28s)]
*  of Palestinians from Gaza. One thing that's clear, President Trump and his plan [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  have the full support of his Israeli counterpart, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=375.36s)]
*  This is the first good idea that I've heard. It's a remarkable idea. And I think it should be [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=381.04s)]
*  really pursued, examined, pursued and done because I think it will create a different [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  future for everyone. He's the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  All right. Joining us now, former chief of staff to Benjamin Netanyahu, George Bernbaum. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=396.32s)]
*  Sir, good morning. Thank you very much for spending some time with us today. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=400.32s)]
*  Good morning, Casey. I'd like to start with the meeting itself and especially the look [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=403.84s)]
*  on the prime minister's face there, as well as some reporting that he was as surprised by this as [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=411.04s)]
*  almost anyone. The New York Times wrote this quote, it wasn't only the Americans who were [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=420.4s)]
*  scrambling after the press conference, the announcement came just as much of a surprise [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=426.0s)]
*  to Mr. Trump's Israeli visitors. Soon before they walked out for their joint news conference on [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=430.0s)]
*  Tuesday, Mr. Trump surprised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel by telling him he [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=434.48s)]
*  planned to announce the Gaza ownership idea, according to two people briefed on their [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=439.52s)]
*  interactions. You've obviously worked closely with Netanyahu. What did you read into his reaction [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=444.48s)]
*  and how surprised was he? Well, I would say this Netanyahu is a very astute follower of political [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=449.84s)]
*  chess. And we saw a few announcements prior to the prime minister's arrival that were a little [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=458.23999999999995s)]
*  strange. One was the announcement that the King of Jordan would be coming to visit the White House [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=463.44s)]
*  in a couple of weeks. And while with all respect to the King of Jordan, I can think of two dozen [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  world leaders that the president, Trump doesn't care about polls anymore. And why would he he [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=472.64s)]
*  has no more elections and doesn't care about the GOP. Hitler was also an anti-war candidate. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=477.2s)]
*  A lot of policies were initially unpopular. No, Trump cares about popularity. You're wrong about [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=480.24s)]
*  that. I think he is he for selfish reasons, for narcissistic reasons, but reasons nonetheless, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=487.28s)]
*  Donald Trump absolutely cares about being popular in a very weird way. It has nothing to do with [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  the election. I don't even think Donald Trump cared about winning the election the first time [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=502.0s)]
*  around. He just kind of lucked into it. And then the second time around, he had to do it out of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=506.56s)]
*  desperation because he was worried about going to jail. He literally said he wanted to ban TikTok [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=510.48s)]
*  in his first in his first term. And then now is known as the savior of TikTok. Why do you think [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=515.2s)]
*  that happened? You're such a leftist joke. Leftist don't joke, my friend. Yeah. How can you live through [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=520.96s)]
*  a decade of Donald Trump? And I'll arrive at the conclusion. I don't think he really cares about [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=526.08s)]
*  polling. I will say this much. Yeah. Also this too has cuck in his name, which is kind of funny. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=528.88s)]
*  Um, I was like this much. I think Donald Trump in a weird way cares more about broad popularity [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=534.4s)]
*  and polling than like the average technocratic Democrat does. Now, having said that, are there [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=540.4s)]
*  things that he does that are deeply unpopular apps of fricking Lutely, right? I'll give you one great [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=545.44s)]
*  example of this. Donald Trump's reaction to the abortion ban once Roe v. Wade was overturned by [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=550.64s)]
*  his Supreme court was very different than the way he was advocating for it beforehand. If given the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  opportunity, I'm fairly certain he would not have ever allowed that to happen. It's even more [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  sinister. The CNN has been talking about this nonstop for the past couple of days while they [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=567.44s)]
*  were dead silent when Israel was openly committing genocide and war crimes in Gaza. Yeah. Because [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=570.1600000000001s)]
*  you know, anti-Trump hits get clicks. Anyway, what I was saying is he cares about popularity, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=575.36s)]
*  but it'll say deeply unpopular. I mean, he'll do sorry, deeply unpopular things, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=582.8000000000001s)]

*  it as a, as the popular option though. Would invite to the white house prior to the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=592.32s)]
*  kingdom of Jordan. Place saw the announcement of a Egypt just a day prior to the prime minister [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=595.44s)]
*  arriving. Of course, Egypt and Jordan being two key players in president Trump's plan. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  So the prime minister may have been surprised that the announcement came so quickly, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  but I believe that he probably was reading the tea leaves a little bit in that president Trump [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=608.96s)]
*  did have something in mind by having these two very strange events occur so early into [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=613.12s)]
*  his presidency regarding the invitation of the king of Jordan, as well as the arms sale to Egypt. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=618.24s)]
*  President Trump's Gaza plan is also upsetting some of the Arab Americans who voted for him. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=623.6s)]
*  A number of those voters are in Dearborn, Michigan, the city with the highest percentage of Arab [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=628.64s)]
*  Americans in the U S they flipped to Trump in 2024, partly to protest president Biden's handling of [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=633.12s)]
*  the crisis in Gaza. Nikki Batiste asked people there how they are feeling now. What do you think [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  your headline will be this week? Gazans will not leave their country. Oh, I think something that, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=646.24s)]
*  yes, I hear the buzzing to or the tinnitus noise. I think something that American leadership [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=655.28s)]
*  discounts, which is leading them to make wrong decisions when, when, when figuring out how to go [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=661.76s)]
*  forward with this Gaza situation is how unimaginably unpopular it would be with the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=671.04s)]
*  actual citizens in these countries. If it were up to MBS and he had full control, if he had a magic [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=679.92s)]
*  wand, he would make all of the Palestinians perish. But the reason why the official Saudi position [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=685.76s)]
*  is that it is a non-starter to do mass ethnic displacement for the Palestinians. The reason why [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=692.9599999999999s)]
*  that is the official Saudi position, despite MBS his own personal distaste for the Palestinian [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=698.64s)]
*  plight is because even in a place like Saudi Arabia, where the numbers of the population are [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=703.36s)]
*  very limited, no matter how many weapons you give MBS, he still has a very real fear of being [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=708.88s)]
*  potentially overthrown by his own population. Okay. Same with Egypt. If MBS were to basically [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=718.16s)]
*  say, I don't really care. Go ahead. We're normalizing. We're normalizing with Israel. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=728.32s)]
*  Okay. There is a likelihood that he get assassinated by an immediate family member. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  Even MBS doesn't have an election to win. Yes. In countries where they don't have American style, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=739.84s)]
*  theoretical democracy, they do things a little differently. Okay. This is one of those issues [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  where enough members of the public would absolutely make a big enough stink and try to [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=753.28s)]
*  actively overthrow their rulers. Okay. Do you understand? They just kind of, they just kind of [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=760.88s)]
*  killed the leaders. Lamar just look at Sadat in Egypt as an example. I'm saying, I'm saying that [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=767.36s)]
*  authoritarian countries have more to fear from genuine rebellion than democratic countries do, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  because a theoretical democracy offers an opportunity. Even if it's just simply [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=781.76s)]
*  the feeling of having political power in the form of your vote, it gives you a pressure valve. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  Authoritarian countries fear rebellion more than democratic countries do. Okay. That's where it [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=797.84s)]
*  actually happens. When there is no alternative in the eyes of the population and the government [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  takes action that is so disastrous, so immoral, so repugnant that they can't stand idly by, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=813.44s)]
*  they will revolt. The only way to maintain a docile population in an authoritarian country, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=821.76s)]
*  because there is always a limit to how long authoritarian regimes can exist. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=828.72s)]
*  The only way to continue operating with mechanisms of control is if you're constantly [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=840.96s)]
*  abiding by the best wishes and the broader public sentiment. They underestimate the prevalence of [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=848.32s)]
*  pan-Arab sentiment in the MENA region. My grandpa was a Saudi general who tried the coup of the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=854.08s)]
*  royals with the first set of normalization in the 70s, failed obviously, lol. Anyway. Thomas [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=857.92s)]
*  Sablani's Arab American newspaper has shared the stories of the country's largest Arab community [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=862.88s)]
*  for 40 years. We have expected from Donald Trump the worst, but he is shocking us of how worse he [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=868.24s)]
*  can be. Here in Dearborn, Michigan, the Democrat usually wins, but last November, President Trump [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=879.5999999999999s)]
*  captured more than 40% of the vote to Vice President Harris's 36%. Part of her loss was [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=885.52s)]
*  due to people not voting for either major party. Sablani says he didn't vote for anyone, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=891.92s)]
*  but blames Democratic candidates for the rare results. The vote for... I will never get over [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=897.84s)]
*  how easy it would have been for Biden to actually reverse course on Gaza. One phone call proven by [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  Steve Witkoff going and telling Benjamin Netanyahu to cut it out, and then Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=912.48s)]
*  actually cutting it out. And yet he chose not to do so, even though there was a severe electoral [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=918.16s)]
*  consequence there. It's crazy. Remember when Joe Biden said he had a red line when Israel decided [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=924.8s)]
*  to do the complete final solution on North Gaza with the hopes of permanent annexation of North [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=932.72s)]
*  Gaza, Biden said, Oh, I'm going to give you a red line, Jack. He gave another red line, a Rafa. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=941.28s)]
*  We all know how that turned out, but the second time was even funnier because he gave him 30 days, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=948.88s)]
*  which was after the election. And then of course he did not abide by the red line. Israel never [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=956.48s)]
*  followed through and Biden kept giving him more weapons and rewarding him all the way till the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=962.64s)]
*  last day. His state department ran propaganda for Israel. I did not forget if they were truly worried [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=969.6s)]
*  about Donald Trump, fucking up the situation, if they truly cared about the plight of Gazans, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  they could have wrapped this shit up ever before it reached Trump's desk. Okay. They handed over [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=985.36s)]
*  the reins to Donald Trump with no care or consideration for Palestinians whatsoever, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=992.0s)]
*  because they don't care. It's that simple. There's no reason to dance around this issue. And [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=996.24s)]
*  many liberals are pretty open. I was told by a prominent liberal streamer today that the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1003.36s)]
*  Rafa red line was an example of Biden saving the day, giving people time to leave Rafa. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1007.04s)]
*  Oh my God, this doesn't make sense. Even in like their own moral system. Okay. Even in the world [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1011.04s)]
*  that they've invented where Biden somehow has the power to halt this, give a stay of execution, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1016.48s)]
*  but also can't stop the execution in its entirety. You know what I mean? It's just so crazy. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  It's just wrong. I don't know how else to describe it other than purely wrong. You know, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1029.04s)]
*  I think a lot of, a lot of liberals, just like a lot of Republicans do, they just want to hear [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1033.76s)]
*  someone with similar opinions, you know, they just want someone to whisper sweet nothing into [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1038.56s)]
*  their ears. They want basically to feel like they're morally righteous, even when all signs [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1044.4s)]
*  point to the fact that they're not. And they want to do that by doing the bare minimum, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1052.3200000000002s)]
*  which is going out and voting. They think it's the most, it is the most moral position. It's the [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1057.68s)]
*  highest form of political activism that one can partake in. It's the first step. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1065.6000000000001s)]
*  They didn't care if they lose either, as long as they can profit off campaigning against Trump, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1074.4s)]
*  they're earning money anyway. Trump was not really a vote for Trump. It's a vote against the Biden [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1080.5600000000002s)]
*  era's administration because they could not stop the carnage that's happening in Gaza. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1086.88s)]
*  If you wouldn't give president Trump a grade for how he's handling [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1092.4s)]
*  Gaza, Middle East, what would it be? I would say like a C plus college senior, Sarah Shaban [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1096.4s)]
*  voted for Trump. She says she gassed when she saw his remarks in Sandy out for hours about how much [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1104.0s)]
*  genocide Joe sucks when we can't change the past, but you can say, I told you so. Meanwhile, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1109.44s)]
*  Trump just called for ethnic cleansing and there's still shit that can be done to stop them. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1112.88s)]
*  I mean, there's even less shit that can be done to stop Donald Trump than there was for Biden. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1116.3200000000002s)]
*  So no, I think covering Biden's ineptitude on this issue is still fairly important to understand. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1121.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like this was happening during an election, man. There's no [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1127.9199999999998s)]
*  clear indication that America does not give a single shred of a fuck about democracy. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1132.32s)]
*  Then not responding to the public pressure, major demonstrations and only responding by telling [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1137.52s)]
*  everybody that they were Hamas supporters and that they were maybe being funded by Iran. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1144.0s)]
*  And then also prosecuting a hundred college campus demonstrators. Like that is crazy. Those [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1148.96s)]
*  numbers are insane. They rarely got coverage in the media, but I have not forgotten. And neither [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1155.6000000000001s)]
*  should you a couple of years from now. When you wonder how we got here, remember the Democrats also [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1160.96s)]
*  were actively pushing to get here. My favorite thing about the social situation as a Palestinian [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  is that they, that the party collectively told me in all of mine to go fuck ourselves nonstop ran a [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1169.76s)]
*  doctor campaign where they told us they were going to win without us and we didn't matter. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1174.4s)]
*  And now turn around and reveal the clan hoods they had hidden the entire time. I mean, did they [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1178.0s)]
*  hide the clan hoods? They literally said, we'll win without you. And also that we're going to [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1181.76s)]
*  keep killing your relatives. So one could say that they were wearing the clan hoods all along [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1186.0s)]
*  pretty openly. Now they just try to act like they weren't wearing the clan hoods. But now you forced [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1190.48s)]
*  me to wear the clan hood when in fact they were wearing it last time around too, you know, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1196.0s)]
*  they were always wearing it. Now they're saying, uh, now you done did it. You forced my hand. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1201.28s)]
*  You got what you wished for. And it's like, well, you didn't, you, you were fine with this happening [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1208.0s)]
*  when you were in charge. And now that you're out of power, you're still fine with it. Nothing really [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1213.52s)]

*  You want to feel like you did your very best when we saw you not doing that. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1227.28s)]
*  I was disappointed, but I also wasn't surprised, but I would say that I kind of find it hard to [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1232.32s)]

*  A little bit. Yeah. But then I thought about it and I was like, there's a ceasefire now. And [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkpuVJkbO4&t=1245.44s)]
