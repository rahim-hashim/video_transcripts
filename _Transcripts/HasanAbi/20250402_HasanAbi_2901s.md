# America Just Declared A Global Trade War? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8)
*  It was pretty funny that I've said this time and time again, like judging by the policies [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=0.0s)]
*  that he wanted to implement when he was running, I kept repeating the same things over and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=6.32s)]
*  over again. Everything that he's doing is inflationary. Okay. Mass deportation is inflationary. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  The right nation where you at least could have goods. Most of the party affordability [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=23.86s)]
*  for goods. Headlong into this squarely behind Donald Trump. It does show his clout in the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=29.42s)]
*  Republican Party to change free traders into pro-tariff Republican senators. It has been [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=34.46s)]
*  Democrats who want this tool. Well, I think it's a warning sign because we have 18 special [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=39.14s)]
*  elections in this year so far and 17 out of the 18 Democrats have won because they do [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=44.86s)]
*  not believe that he's doing enough to lower costs. So if costs go up, it's a big red flag [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=51.18s)]
*  for Republicans because I'm not sure they can come back from it. And it sounds like [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=56.82s)]
*  they are in fact going to go up in the short term. We'll see about the long term. Jake [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=60.54s)]
*  Tapper standing by for the lead starts right now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=64.82s)]
*  This is CNN breaking news. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=67.82s)]
*  What kind of trade do we have with Russia at this point? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=74.82s)]
*  Welcome to the lead and I am Jake Tapper. Our breaking news just moments ago. President [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=78.61999999999999s)]
*  Trump officially announcing widespread what he calls reciprocal tariffs, at least 10% [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=81.82s)]
*  on practically all goods coming into the United States plus higher rates on dozens of countries [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  that have the highest trade deficits with the United States. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=93.36s)]
*  We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us. So [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=98.28s)]
*  the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal. I could have done that, yes, but it would [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=103.96s)]
*  have been tough for a lot of countries who didn't want to do that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=111.08s)]
*  I do like the sneaky move that they did where they added that in the fine print, they added [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  this tiny thing where they are like, well, they are doing currency manipulation and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=119.72s)]
*  other restrictions in trade, like making it seem as though there is, you know, when you [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=122.48s)]
*  add that in the fine print, obviously it could be anything that they are talking about to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=128.64s)]
*  make this calculation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=132.9s)]
*  The world economy could end up impacting every American in the short term and the long term, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=133.9s)]
*  raising prices in the short term at a time when budgets are already stretched thin from [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=138.28s)]
*  years of inflation. President Trump says that the tariffs in the long run will create more [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=143.1s)]
*  jobs in the United States and revive certain manufacturing sectors and even entire regions [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=149.28s)]
*  by forcing companies to relocate their manufacturing to the United States, in some cases back to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  the United States. It is a gamble and it is risky. Some Republican lawmakers are not sold. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=161.48s)]
*  In the long run, we are all dead. Short run matters too. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=168.48s)]
*  Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, I'm sorry, but the f***ing liberal media is so cucked by [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=174.12s)]
*  Donald Trump. If Joe Brandon did something like this, they would be calling to assassinate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=181.12s)]
*  him. Okay? But when it's Trump doing it, they are like, well, it's a risky gamble. I f***ing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=186.12s)]
*  hate the media, dude. I hate them so much. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  Our own Caitlin Collins. Caitlin, walk us through the details. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=195.24s)]
*  Once again, I'm jealous. Once again, I'm jealous. I'm jealous of Trump's riz. I'm jealous that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=198.36s)]
*  he's able to f***ing do this. The market reaction after hours, I've never seen anything like [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=202.08s)]
*  this. This is worse than the worst case scenario in terms of what the market expected. CNBC [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=208.52s)]
*  reporting that the 10% baseline will go into effect on April 5th. The reciprocal tariffs [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  will go into effect on April 9th. Canada and Mexico tariffs stays at 25%. The White House [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=216.12s)]
*  is not looking for deals on this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=220.24s)]
*  Two or three times higher than that as part of those reciprocal tariffs for what the White [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=221.72000000000003s)]
*  House and the President have determined are unfair trading practices, they say, against [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=226.56s)]
*  some of these closest U.S. allies that now will be paying much higher than that baseline [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=231.08s)]
*  rate. And just looking at this right off the bat, Jake, you see European Union is going [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=235.52s)]
*  to be a 20% reciprocal tariff. Taiwan, 32%. Vietnam, 46% reciprocal tariffs. Japan is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=239.32000000000002s)]
*  coming in at 24%. And India at 26%. Just to give you a small preview, Jake, into these [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  tariffs that the White House is now going to be implementing. We've heard from senior [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=254.4s)]
*  officials about varying dates of when those tariffs will go into place. The President [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  said immediately just now, in addition to that 25% tariff on all foreign-made cars. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=262.72s)]
*  What you are seeing here are the most expansive tariffs that we have seen from President Trump, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  including from his first term. And as he noted here in the Rose Garden, this is something [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=272.8s)]
*  he's been talking about for decades and certainly did on the campaign trail this time around. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  But of course, the question is how other nations will respond to this and how the stock market [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=281.6s)]
*  The White House seemed to suggest earlier in a briefing with reporters that they have [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=287.24s)]
*  very little appetite for any kind of haggling with countries that are trying to reduce their [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=290.56s)]
*  tariffs and the lead up to this to try to get this to be lower. And also they issued [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=294.44s)]
*  a warning, Jake, to countries that have promised they will retaliate in response to these new [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  tariffs from President Trump. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=303.32s)]
*  All right, Caitlin Collins. Thanks so much. Look out for Caitlin in just a few hours on [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=304.8s)]
*  the source. That's weeknights at 9 Eastern, only here on CNN. CNN's Daniel Dale, our [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=308.36s)]
*  fact checker, was closely listening to the president's remark to check out and suss out [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=314.6s)]
*  the facts there. Daniel, what President Trump had to say about Canadian dairy tariffs? Is [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=319.36s)]
*  that accurate? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  It was not even close to accurate, Jake. So President Trump said Canada treats the first [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=326.6s)]
*  little carton of milk that the U.S. exports as a low tariff product. But then after that, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=331.88s)]
*  Canada applies massive tariffs in excess of 200 percent. It is not just the first little [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=336.88s)]
*  carton of milk that has low tariffs. In fact, under the U.S. MCA deal that Trump himself [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=341.78s)]
*  negotiated, tens of thousands of metric tons per year of U.S. milk are treated as tariff-free [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=346.58s)]
*  by Canada. That is guaranteed tariff-free market access by Canada. And here's the key [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=353.94s)]
*  thing, Jake. The U.S. is not exporting even close to that tariff-free quota maximum, so [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=359.18s)]
*  none of those hefty Canadian tariffs above the quota level are actually being applied. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=364.41999999999996s)]
*  And that was just one of the false claims he made, Jake. He also offered what I think [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=369.22s)]
*  is some pretty alternative history, saying that the U.S. was at proportionally its wealthiest [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=373.18s)]
*  from 1789 to 1913. The U.S. is way wealthier today by any reasonable measure, including [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=378.5s)]
*  per capita income, living standards. And then he said that the U.S. would not have had the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=385.22s)]
*  Great Depression had the U.S. stayed with tariffs. Well, there was a pretty infamous [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=389.34000000000003s)]
*  tariff in 1930, the Smoot-Hawley tariff, that is widely seen to have contributed to worsening [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  that Great Depression. He also repeated his claim that the U.S. took in hundreds of billions [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=398.94s)]
*  of dollars that China paid because of tariffs he imposed in his first term. It is U.S. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  importers who made those tariff payments. Study after study has found that U.S. consumers [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=408.94s)]
*  and businesses ate the overwhelming majority of the costs of those tariffs. And so it is [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=413.82s)]
*  just not true that China was paying that money. He also falsely said that the U.S. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=418.73999999999995s)]
*  had the highest inflation in its history under President Biden. Yes, of course, it was high. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=423.17999999999995s)]
*  It was troubling, not even close to a record. And he said that gasoline is, quote, way under [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=427.58000000000004s)]
*  three dollars now. It is true in some states, but the national average today, according [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=432.22s)]
*  to AAA, is about three dollars and 24 cents per gallon. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=436.82s)]
*  Jake, if you're not going to use that was a lot. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  Daniel Dale, thanks so much. Appreciate it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=443.90000000000003s)]
*  Let's bring in CNN's Phil Mattingly and Vanessa, your cave. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=446.26s)]
*  Right. It's not possible within Trump's economic impacts of this all. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  Phil, so let's let's start. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=453.66s)]
*  Yes. You. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=455.1s)]
*  You have rebuilding American manufacturing is not possible within the four year time [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=456.18s)]
*  frame that Trump will be president, but Trump won't be president for four years. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=459.86s)]
*  He'll continue being the impact. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=463.02s)]
*  The average American. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  It's a middle ground of the approach that had been laid out and I think options that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=465.5s)]
*  have been presented to President Trump. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=470.18s)]
*  What does that actually mean? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=472.65999999999997s)]
*  That means this is more significant, more consequential, more grand on a scale when [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=473.82s)]
*  it comes to tariffs than anything we have seen in roughly 70 to 80 years. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=478.74s)]
*  It is a complete reorientation of the global trading system as we've known it for the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=482.86s)]
*  better part of the post World War Two era. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=486.94s)]
*  The reciprocal tariffs did not go in full presence. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=489.18s)]
*  I cut them in half. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=491.94s)]
*  Therefore, it's not necessarily tariff for tariff. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=492.98s)]
*  Right. He was proposing a much bigger deal, even though this is a big deal. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=494.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=498.02000000000004s)]
*  So in the face of all this, they are adding a non tariff. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=498.22s)]
*  What do you what can I do? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=500.58000000000004s)]
*  What they believe are restrictions that what can I do or what can I say scale of them [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=502.22s)]
*  country by country for the 60 ish countries that they are actually like? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=506.74s)]
*  I've given up. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=510.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=511.7s)]
*  What do you want me to do? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=512.3s)]
*  I have no campaign. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=513.66s)]
*  You talked about having I have nothing to say or do in this process about reciprocal [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=515.34s)]
*  tariffs. The Trump glazers are going. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=519.1s)]
*  Yeah, this is Bayes. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=521.62s)]
*  Exactly what he did today. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=522.74s)]
*  I think people need to understand. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=524.26s)]
*  I'm actually if you look at the markets right now and futures, I don't necessarily know [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=525.9s)]
*  that everybody's grasping one the scale of this. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=528.98s)]
*  Right. And two, just how serious his advisor. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=531.9s)]
*  I also do think that crisis like this presents an opportunity. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=535.62s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=538.86s)]
*  Maybe this is the accelerant that is capitalism. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=540.42s)]
*  This is the accelerant that inevitably brings about the contradictions of the forefront, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=545.62s)]
*  making Americans realize that the volatility of their material circumstances are far too [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=550.62s)]
*  much to bear. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=558.3399999999999s)]
*  And therefore, they don't magically become revolutionary figures or whatever. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=559.62s)]
*  That's not my assumption. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=564.22s)]
*  But they they realize that this harm is being caused by right wing reactionary charlatans [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=565.9s)]
*  on all three point three trillion dollars worth of goods coming into this country now, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=571.86s)]
*  at least 10 percent. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=577.38s)]
*  But as the president mentioned, there are higher tariffs on countries that he says are [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=578.78s)]
*  bad actors. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=583.62s)]
*  Ultimately, though, he says he cut those tariffs in half sort of to play more fair to give [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=585.06s)]
*  these countries a break. But let's just take China, for example. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=590.38s)]
*  Now, a 34 percent tariff on China. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=592.8199999999999s)]
*  We get a lot of electronics from China. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=595.26s)]
*  Vietnam, a 50, a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=597.54s)]
*  Now we got a lot of shoes appliances from there. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=601.26s)]
*  Colombia, a 10 percent tariff. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=604.62s)]
*  We get coffee from there. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=606.46s)]
*  Bananas. We get bananas from Ecuador, Guatemala, Costa Rica. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=607.86s)]
*  Now at least a 10 percent tariff there. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=612.38s)]
*  And ultimately, we have these auto tariffs also coming tomorrow, a 25 percent tax on [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=614.9399999999999s)]
*  all foreign imports of cars. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=621.22s)]
*  On a country like South Korea, for example, they are they are the country that has Hyundai. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=623.5s)]
*  Right. So they are going to experience a 25 percent tariff on autos. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=629.0999999999999s)]
*  And now under this new reciprocal tariff plan, an additional 25 percent on all exports [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=634.3399999999999s)]
*  coming out of South Korea. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=641.5s)]
*  So for any product that Americans import and buy from abroad, at least a 10 percent [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=643.2199999999999s)]
*  tariff, if you do not see a Made in America sticker or tag, you're going to be paying [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=649.66s)]
*  some numbers. This is really important because it's going to hit everything from food to [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=654.78s)]
*  cars to appliances to pharmaceuticals. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=659.6999999999999s)]
*  It's just so wide sweeping. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=662.42s)]
*  As Phil mentioned, it could have been worse based on what we were hearing. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=664.1s)]
*  But ultimately, if you think about anything that you consume and buy from abroad, you're [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=668.06s)]
*  likely going to see some sort of price increase in the near future. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=672.3399999999999s)]
*  All right, Vanessa Yurkiewicz and Phil Manningly, thanks so much. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=676.66s)]
*  Let's bring in former Biden senior economics aide, Gene Sperling. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=679.06s)]
*  He left the administration to work with the Kamala Harris presidential campaign. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=683.26s)]
*  Gene, are there any of the tariffs, any of the moves that President Trump announced today [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=688.06s)]
*  that you think could benefit the United States? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=693.9399999999999s)]
*  I think that in general, the focus on relocating manufacturing where it's going to be part of [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=698.9s)]
*  our economic future is one that was a major Biden message. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=706.22s)]
*  I think the focus on using tariffs in strategic areas where we're either we've been [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=711.38s)]
*  treated unfairly or it's important to our future like semiconductors, the chips program, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=719.1800000000001s)]
*  electric batteries. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=726.26s)]
*  Those are so the overall message done right is one President Biden focused on. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=727.98s)]
*  But what you see here is the fact that, you know, what might be a good, simplistic, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=735.02s)]
*  historically rewritten speech in a campaign will ultimately turn out, come down to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=741.74s)]
*  effect on the economy. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=749.18s)]
*  The expression, the devil's in the details. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=750.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, here the devil is in prices for consumers, the the devil's in jobs, the devil's in [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=752.3399999999999s)]
*  uncertainty. And what we've seen so far, despite the Trump rhetoric, is that he was [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=759.54s)]
*  inheriting, he likes to say beautiful or rather beautiful soft landing. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=765.78s)]
*  People are expecting growth to be over 2 percent, inflation coming down towards 2 percent. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=770.2199999999999s)]
*  He has set off an almost unprecedented amount of uncertainty at every level. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=775.9399999999999s)]
*  Investor, major manufacturers, small businesses and a dramatic increase in a loss of [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=781.2199999999999s)]
*  consumer confidence. In fact, the conference board, Jake, said that over the next 12 [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=788.74s)]
*  months, it's now the worst it's been in 12 years. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=793.94s)]
*  That means worse than the pandemic. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=798.66s)]
*  So remember, the United Negro College Fund used to say a great mind is a terrible thing [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=800.7s)]
*  to waste. Well, a soft landing is a terrible thing to waste. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=805.54s)]
*  And what and so what's going to come down is what is the actual impact on prices? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=810.0600000000001s)]
*  I think will be very negative for consumers. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=815.7s)]
*  What will it be on actual the economy, the strength manufacturing? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=818.3s)]
*  I think we're already seeing the uncertainty is being harmful. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=822.9s)]
*  That's going to be the ultimate measure. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=826.5s)]
*  So obviously, President Trump has a big picture goal here to bring jobs back to the [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=828.06s)]
*  United States as firms relocate here to avoid these tariffs, to make it cheaper to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=835.54s)]
*  build in Arizona and Indiana than to build in Taiwan or China. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=841.8599999999999s)]
*  Do you think that will happen? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=848.3s)]
*  Again, he's talking about the UNCF. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=853.0999999999999s)]
*  A strategic way to do it. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=854.8599999999999s)]
*  I think he should have built off the chips program, built off the Biden's IRA. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=856.2199999999999s)]
*  Those use not just sticks, but carrots. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=861.6999999999999s)]
*  They were about incentivizing those locations in the areas like electric batteries, like [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=865.2199999999999s)]
*  semiconductors, more we could do on AI data centers, quantum computing, and also just [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=872.62s)]
*  making sure our steel and auto industries are being treated fairly. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=878.5s)]
*  But I think he has three major blind spots. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=884.58s)]
*  One is he has no sense of of inputs. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=888.58s)]
*  And I know that sounds like a complicated thing. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=892.3s)]
*  But look at pickup trucks. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=894.86s)]
*  Pickup trucks are maybe the favorite truck of many of Trump's supporters. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=897.0600000000001s)]
*  A huge percentage of the parts that come in come in from other countries. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=903.1800000000001s)]
*  That makes them more affordable. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=909.0600000000001s)]
*  So you heard the same thing from Mattel about making Barbie dolls. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=910.94s)]
*  So he seems to forget that in order to not only produce things here, but produce them [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=915.2600000000001s)]
*  at an attractive price will requires a more complicated view of trade. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=921.5799999999999s)]
*  What I hear everywhere from big companies is they have almost a war room on supply. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=928.18s)]
*  They are worried about supply constraints. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=933.5799999999999s)]
*  They're worried about the prices. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=936.18s)]
*  They are all worried about passing on the prices. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=937.8599999999999s)]
*  And, Jake, why am I here talking to you as a non-White House person? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=941.66s)]
*  Well, it wasn't that we didn't have a strong economy. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=945.8599999999999s)]
*  The U.S. had the strongest growth. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=948.6199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't that we didn't have strong jobs. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=950.26s)]
*  We had the strongest jobs of all time. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=952.46s)]
*  I'm sitting here talking to you because people were unhappy about prices. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=954.66s)]
*  And it's shocking to me that he seems to care so little about how much basic [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=958.78s)]
*  consumer prices from avocados to vegetables to iPhones are going to go up for people [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=965.58s)]
*  and cars by thousands, maybe over ten thousand dollars. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=972.74s)]
*  It's pretty floating. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=976.58s)]
*  I just feel like it's really a blind spot. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=977.62s)]
*  It surprises me politically as well as being questionable economically. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=980.74s)]
*  And I don't think things are pretty funny that I've said this time and time again, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=986.3399999999999s)]
*  like judging by the policies that he wanted to implement when he was running, I kept [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=991.42s)]
*  repeating the same things over and over again. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=996.38s)]
*  Everything that he's doing is inflationary. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=999.6999999999999s)]
*  OK. Mass deportation is inflationary. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1002.5s)]
*  You're eradicating the low cost, second class citizen, permanent underclass labor [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1006.54s)]
*  force without any mechanism of replacement. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1013.22s)]
*  Now, obviously, I care about the humanity beyond like the impact of this on the economy. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1016.1s)]
*  I care about the humanity first and foremost. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1020.74s)]
*  But that's precisely that is what precisely would lead to hyperinflation to begin with. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1022.98s)]
*  Then also the fucking tariffs. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1028.58s)]
*  Tariffs are an entry fee paid by the American manufacturers, paid by the American importers. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1031.46s)]
*  This will increase the price of price of all goods. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1038.98s)]
*  It's like a it's like slapping on a universal sales tax. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1042.7s)]
*  Every single thing he's done, every single thing he's done so far has been inflationary. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1046.6599999999999s)]

*  So I think, again, where Republicans have incredible unity is on the spending cuts as [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1989.8600000000001s)]
*  we're seeing. So when it comes to the timeline of all of this, I do notice that now [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=1996.82s)]
*  reconciliation, it seems to be an agreement between the House and the Senate that they're [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2001.5800000000002s)]
*  willing to consider about. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2005.3s)]
*  Andrew episode month, economists in Israel, economic officials in Israel in complete shock [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2007.82s)]
*  over the Trump administration's decision to impose a 17 percent tariff on Israel. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2013.5s)]
*  We are in shock. We were sure the decision to completely cancel tariffs on imports from [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2016.5s)]
*  US would prevent this move, but it didn't happen. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2020.22s)]
*  Yeah, get fucked, dude. Get fucked. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2023.3s)]
*  I mean, it's not enough. 17 percent is a tiny minute. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2026.1s)]
*  So that's when you plan to get this tax bill. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2030.06s)]
*  So if we could put all both these stories together today, the president comes out with [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2033.58s)]
*  tariffs. Trump is anti-semitically imposing tariffs on Israel. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2037.34s)]
*  Trump is anti-semitically doing BDS. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2041.94s)]
*  Who is going? OK, Forward Magazine article. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2044.34s)]
*  I'm imagining. OK, Forward Magazine article title Trump Stood Against Boycott, Divestments [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2046.62s)]
*  and Sanctions. Now he does the very same subtitle is Trump Hamas. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2053.46s)]
*  And the CBO scoring. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2061.02s)]
*  So that will be something running in the background. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2062.82s)]
*  And as the president said, we've taken in several hundred billion dollars on the China [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2065.8599999999997s)]
*  tariffs, but those those don't get scored. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2070.14s)]
*  Do you feel that you need to have enough revenue raised from these tariffs before this [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2073.3399999999997s)]
*  reconciliation package comes to play in Congress? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2078.66s)]
*  Well, I don't think we have to have the revenues raised. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2082.2999999999997s)]
*  And look, we're doing two things. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2085.62s)]
*  Tariffs are going to raise revenues. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2087.7799999999997s)]
*  And then we're also the stamping out waste, fraud and abuse in the government and bringing [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2089.5s)]
*  down the expenses and spending. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2095.8999999999996s)]
*  And we're not going to get credit for either of those with the CBO scoring. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2099.1s)]
*  So when your audience, when American people see these CBO scores, there could be the [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2103.2599999999998s)]
*  large, but there is a substantial amount of tariff income. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2109.7s)]
*  There's a substantial amount of savings. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2113.8999999999996s)]
*  While all this is happening, consumer sentiment has definitely taken a bit of a dive. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2116.98s)]
*  Expectations for inflation have gone up. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2121.58s)]
*  Banks like Goldman are cutting their GDP forecast, saying potentially the Fed is going [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2123.7799999999997s)]
*  to have to cut rates, not the good kind of cuts, the kind of cuts because they're nervous [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2128.3s)]
*  about growth. How concerned are you that the timing of all this is going to be incredibly [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2132.18s)]
*  challenging because of how the American consumer, how corporate America is feeling at [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2138.02s)]
*  this moment? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2144.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, it tells me a couple of things. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2144.9s)]
*  One, we've got to get the tax bill done quickly. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2146.2599999999998s)]
*  So that's a confidence builder. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2148.86s)]
*  And two, we're seeing sentiment surveys from the American people, but we haven't actually [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2151.34s)]
*  seen them take action. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2157.02s)]
*  If the households actually thought that they were going to be employees, if their real [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2158.46s)]
*  inflation expectations had increased, what would they be doing? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2163.94s)]
*  They'd be hoarding goods and they would be demanding wage increases. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2167.38s)]
*  And neither one of those has happened yet. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2171.46s)]
*  So at the moment, you're not concerned about some of the soft data we're seeing? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2173.22s)]
*  No, I see nothing. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2177.1s)]
*  And one of the great things, many great things about being a treasury is we have lots of [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2178.7s)]
*  business people come through and everything we're seeing in the economy is still very [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2183.94s)]
*  solid. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2190.1s)]
*  And executives haven't voiced any of these concerns onto you? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2190.98s)]
*  No, there's there's some idiosyncratic things. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2194.8199999999997s)]
*  But in terms of the expectations actually turning into hard data, none of them have [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2197.54s)]
*  seen it yet. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2203.98s)]
*  Now that you're working on the tax bill and of course, tariffs at the moment are out of [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2204.86s)]
*  the way. What else is on the agenda for you for the rest of the year? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2208.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, we have the Ukraine deal that's coming up. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2211.66s)]
*  We've gone to maximum pressure on Iran. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2216.5s)]
*  So a big part of Treasury is national security. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2219.2599999999998s)]
*  And then we are doing a big push on deregulating in a smart, safe and sound way the regulated [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2222.98s)]
*  financial institutions, which is going to allow for the private sector, not the government [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2230.22s)]
*  sector, to grow. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2235.1s)]
*  When it comes to international, where are you with Ukraine and the mineral deal? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2236.8999999999996s)]
*  I believe we may have a team from Ukraine coming over as soon as the end of this week or [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2243.8199999999997s)]
*  the beginning of next week. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2250.4199999999996s)]
*  Ukrainians have I believe that they've hired counsel. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2251.8999999999996s)]
*  And what we did was after the incident in the White House on, I believe it was February [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2255.74s)]
*  28th, we were going to sign a four page deal that was parameters of understanding. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2262.5s)]
*  And at Treasury, we took the opportunity to move forward to the big deal. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2268.34s)]
*  So this is the exact same deal that would have resulted from the four page signature [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2273.7s)]
*  deal. So we've just fast forwarded and we didn't want to lose any time because we believe [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2279.98s)]
*  this deal is so important for the American people, for the Ukrainian people and for the [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2285.42s)]
*  peace process. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2289.54s)]
*  So it sounds like in the next two weeks, you're going to have this deal. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2290.58s)]
*  You know, it's funny is coming is the only thing you will have soon. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2292.7400000000002s)]
*  When it comes to Iran, you mentioned the only terror free action you'll be able to do is [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2296.3s)]
*  basically sit there the tax deals and masturbate. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2302.78s)]
*  When it comes to Iran, do you think we could see secondary terror, secondary sanctions? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2306.3s)]
*  Well, we've already seen sanctions for the first time. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2310.8999999999996s)]
*  U.S. Treasury sanctioned a so-called teapot refinery, which is a private sector refinery in [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2316.02s)]
*  China. And they are the buyers of the Iranian oil. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2322.06s)]
*  And we could see more of that. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2326.14s)]
*  Wow. Interesting. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2328.06s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, you've been very generous with your time today. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2329.54s)]
*  We really appreciate it here at Bloomberg TV. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2332.74s)]
*  Thank you so much. Good to see you. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2334.46s)]
*  Joe Kaley, of course, that was the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2336.7s)]
*  The sense I got from him is when it comes to these tariffs, it is a ceiling. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2340.18s)]
*  It is a cap. Says to me that this administration is willing to negotiate with trading [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2345.3399999999997s)]
*  partners. All right. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2350.3399999999997s)]
*  Bloomberg's Anne-Marie Hordurn live at the White House with the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2352.8599999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. And of course, we did hear from President Trump the suggestion that if [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2356.8599999999997s)]
*  countries would like to see exemptions, they're going to have to lower their rates or [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2361.2599999999998s)]
*  terminate their tariffs, to use the word of the president. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2366.06s)]
*  We'll have much more on this shortly and get some political analysis from our panel this [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2368.78s)]
*  evening. Still ahead here on Balance of Power on Bloomberg TV and Radio. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2372.9s)]
*  Isn't it funny that Trump tariffed Israel but not Russia? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2381.9s)]
*  Bro, what kind of trade do we have with Russia? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2384.0600000000004s)]
*  Two point one trillion white from the stock market and Trump wants to raise 700 billion in these [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2386.3s)]
*  tariffs. This is going to be so stupid. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2390.7400000000002s)]
*  Help. I'm going to do not come state. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2393.42s)]
*  There's no such thing. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2395.34s)]
*  Brave warriors, you will always be able to come. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2397.06s)]
*  They will never be able to stop your revolutionary optimism. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2400.38s)]
*  They will never be able to stop your power, your prowess, your sexual prowess will be the only weapon you [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2404.98s)]
*  wield against all of these tariffs. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2413.02s)]
*  After all, at the end of the day, even if you do not have materials to consume, we still have [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2416.5s)]
*  our imagination. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2426.58s)]
*  And until they put a tariff on imagination, you will still be able to come and you'll be coming so hard. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2428.3s)]
*  You'll say, please, Mr. President, I don't want to come no more. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2436.1800000000003s)]

*  What a day. What a day. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2442.82s)]
*  Canada, Mexico, targets of Trump's previous rounds of tariffs and are the United States top trading partners [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2444.06s)]

*  If Canada, Mexico are left out of the country, specific tariffs announced by Trump today, and it looks that way, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2453.42s)]
*  this will be a significant capitulation even both as both nations continue to face tariffs plus sectoral [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2457.42s)]
*  tariffs, such as on steel and aluminum, as well as on autos. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2461.78s)]
*  The majority of nations listed for reciprocal tariffs on the documents distributed to reporters are developing [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2464.5s)]
*  economies. They will include world's poorest nations, South Sudan, Burundi and central African republic, as [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2469.7400000000002s)]

*  So, I mean, here's what Ryan Grim is saying. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2650.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2653.78s)]
*  And this is correct. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2654.34s)]
*  North America could genuinely be self-sufficient though. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2655.94s)]
*  It might take the, it might take us like 10 years to get there and would be a brutal transition, but it would be a good thing in the end. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2658.3s)]
*  Hard to see the US do a solo without a huge collapse in standard of living. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2664.94s)]
*  But anyway, Trump seems to expect us to do it in a few days. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2668.02s)]
*  Good luck to us. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2670.54s)]
*  Like every country has the, well, no country can be fully self-sufficient. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2671.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2675.86s)]
*  I don't know why Ryan Grim is a Jewishist. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2676.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2679.9s)]
*  Ryan Grim is upholding the immortal science of Marxist Leninist Jewishism, which I don't, I don't agree with. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2680.78s)]
*  I don't even think it's necessarily a good thing to be entirely self-sufficient. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2690.34s)]
*  I think it's fine to, to, you know, offshore certain products or, or there's obviously not like, what do you do with rubber? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2697.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2706.1800000000003s)]
*  What, what, what are you supposed to do? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2706.78s)]
*  Invent it? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2708.02s)]
*  And this is why he says North America and not the United States of America, because he's talking about Mexico and, and Canada as well. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2708.86s)]
*  But even then, even then I think ultimately, I think ultimately there is not all matter of international trade is [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2714.78s)]
*  bad. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2726.3799999999997s)]
*  But in the short term, I don't think Americans that only care about treats and the cost of living in general will allow this kind of [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2727.06s)]
*  market shock to, to go on without severe repercussion. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2737.2599999999998s)]
*  Because as I've said, it's the only thing that holds the American society together. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2743.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2748.5s)]
*  The only thing that holds American society together is the fact that the labor aristocracy still benefits from the uneven [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2749.94s)]
*  exchange from the global South, where no matter how low prices get, there's a lot of shit that you can purchase that make you [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2758.38s)]
*  feel like you're in a better position overall. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2768.42s)]
*  When you can't purchase those things now, all of a sudden you're, you're going to be like, what's the entire project for? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2771.9s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2777.46s)]
*  America only cares about the short term. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2778.3799999999997s)]
*  So this, and this, it makes sense as we'll piss them off. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2779.8999999999996s)]
*  There's also the other side of this, which is like, how are we certain that this will boost domestic manufacturing? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2783.22s)]
*  Not even in a short timeframe, but in any timeframe whatsoever. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2791.98s)]
*  And how will that be beneficial? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2796.2599999999998s)]
*  How will that be beneficial for American labor in general? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2798.14s)]
*  Because let's say you bring back manufacturing, but now Americans are in an infinitely shittier position overall, and they're [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2803.18s)]
*  desperate to take on any job whatsoever. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2809.66s)]
*  There's no curbing back on a lot of the big ticket items that Americans must purchase for upward social mobility or services that [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2812.14s)]
*  they must hire for upward social mobility or, or healthcare, right? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2819.54s)]
*  Or housing, shelter. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2823.66s)]
*  If you don't fix any of those problems and you bring back manufacturing, people are in an incredibly desperate predicament where [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2825.62s)]
*  they'll go and work at these factories with diminished labor protections, with diminished worker protections. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2832.58s)]
*  They still can't afford the treats that they want to afford. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2839.9s)]
*  They're in a worse position overall. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2843.06s)]
*  It's unsustainable. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2844.7799999999997s)]
*  It's completely unsustainable, both in the short term and in the long term, especially when, so stupid, especially, especially [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2846.34s)]
*  without trying to find a solution to the cost of living crisis for all of the important necessities, all the important things [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2856.18s)]
*  that you need, goods and services that you need for survival, upward social mobility and things like that. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2863.46s)]
*  And if the manufacturing capabilities of America is boosted and yet it doesn't actually yield higher, better labor [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2869.8599999999997s)]
*  protections or higher, higher wages in general. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2880.34s)]
*  And it's just mostly automated manufacturing anyway. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2887.38s)]
*  And the labor force that still works. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpO2bqz9j8&t=2892.1000000000004s)]
