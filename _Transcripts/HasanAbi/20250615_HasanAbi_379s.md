**HasanAbi:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI)
*  I'm like, hey man, I got an ankle issue. I had a serious ankle injury. I rolled into it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's like a very common is a very common injury when playing basketball. It's almost like yeah, you should do ketamine [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=5.82s)]
*  The doctor should give you ketamine for it. Okay. Thanks, man [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=12.02s)]
*  Yeah, I'm good. Anyway, um [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, I ate poorly was some caram Marie Antoine got him [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=23.06s)]
*  With the family went to bed woke up early went out played basketball and the absolute worst thing that could have possibly happened [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=30.0s)]
*  Happened to me while I was playing basketball. I'm getting guarded by a new guy first game is fantastic [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=37.12s)]
*  We destroy him five on five full court [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=42.76s)]
*  second game comes around [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=45.64s)]
*  Second game comes around playing again. I go for a three-point [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=47.72s)]
*  dude sticks his foot under me I [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=52.24s)]
*  Step on his foot and I roll my ankle [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  I hear a massive crunch and I don't know I don't know what's gonna happen. I wrapped it. I wrapped it [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=59.28s)]
*  instantly, I was like I'm done I came and walk I came and walk is fucked up and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=66.48s)]
*  It's so it's so lame. I mean he apologized for it. It's all good. It's swollen [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=70.88s)]
*  Elevated I said no rice doesn't work. You're supposed rice literally doesn't work. You're supposed to walk it [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=77.84s)]
*  Okay, guys, you're supposed to compress it and you're supposed to walk it. Okay rice technique is [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=83.46000000000001s)]
*  Outdated I should have never started talking about this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=90.78s)]
*  Because I know everyone is gonna say rice, but there are newer approaches to rice rest ice compression and elevation [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=94.26s)]
*  Rice is rest avoid using injured area ice applying ice packs to the affected area cool the tissue relief pan and reduces swelling compression [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  Wrapping the insured injured area with elastic bandage to reduce swelling and provide support elevation [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=109.44s)]
*  You do this every single time. I know elevation keeping injured area raised above the head [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=114.12s)]
*  rest is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=119.48s)]
*  Rest is fine, but you're supposed to do load or activity management. Okay [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=121.28s)]
*  You're not supposed to just not walk on it at all. As a matter of fact, I should be walking on it [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=127.6s)]
*  It needs there needs to be constant blood flow into the area compression is still good [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=134.44s)]
*  Ice is not good compression is the only thing that's still good. Yes [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  Compression is the only thing that's good [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=145.56s)]
*  In terms of the compression is the only thing that's good as far as like the old school [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=148.16s)]
*  the old school injury treatment [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe1YQRE39ZI&t=154.04s)]
