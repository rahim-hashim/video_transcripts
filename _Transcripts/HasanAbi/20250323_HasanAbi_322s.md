# New Food For Kaya | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc)
*  But in any case, yeah, I balled. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=0.0s)]
*  I went to a fancy food store where they told me they don't even sell Royal canine like [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=28.8s)]
*  his Kai's Royal canine is out. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=37.24s)]
*  It's supposed to be coming in today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=40.2s)]
*  And I was like, can I get can I get Royal canine adult giant food? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=42.28s)]
*  And the guy was like, no Royal canine like the dog, the dog food on there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=49.56s)]
*  Not bad. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=57.56s)]
*  Oh, I haven't I cocked it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=58.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=60.28s)]
*  And now now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=61.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=62.28s)]
*  This is it's not a hashtag out by the way, but this is what I use for guy usually like [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=63.28s)]
*  the giant breed one. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  But they said that it has like they said that it has like fillers and like chicken and like [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  a bunch of fillers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=76.48s)]
*  So then he suggested something that's like comparable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=77.6s)]
*  That's better. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  I got her. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=82.56s)]
*  I got her new food. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=83.56s)]
*  Hopefully she's not going to be paying everywhere. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=85.28s)]
*  But I like Royal canine because like, oh, is that why vets suggested Royal canine takes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=88.4s)]
*  your vets out to launch? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=93.28s)]
*  So they suggest it to you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=94.28s)]
*  I mean, it's it's also been good. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=95.64s)]
*  Like it's been good for Kaia for the record. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=97.44s)]
*  Like she likes it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=100.2s)]
*  She enjoys the food and also her poops are excellent. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=102.14s)]
*  So that's what it is. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=107.12s)]
*  And also, yeah, but it's weird because like I arrived at Royal canine on my own, but my [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ysaodnJUc&t=108.58000000000001s)]
