# Will The U.S. Ever Talk To Hamas Directly? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI)
*  I just don't think that a $400 million plan is going to change Trump's analysis on this, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=0.0s)]
*  especially when it's coming from a party that isn't exactly fully invested in the emancipation [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=8.0s)]
*  of Palestinians. Definitely more sympathetic to the Palestinian plight as opposed to the rest [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  of the Gulf leadership, but still. Are you willing to hand over all the hostages [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=20.0s)]
*  to bring an end to the bloodshed? We have said it for all the mediators and for the Americans. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=30.08s)]
*  We are ready to hand over all the prisoners immediately if we can be sure that this will [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=36.32s)]
*  Yo, I can't believe this terrorist is interviewing. I can't believe this terrorist supporter is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=42.32s)]
*  interviewing a terrorist. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  ...to an end of this war and first and foremost to allow the humanitarian aid to get into Gaza. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  If these two conditions are fulfilled again to allow aid to get into Gaza and to reach an end, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=59.52s)]
*  to guarantee an end of this war, regime genocide, yes, we are ready to hand over all the prisoners. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=67.76s)]
*  Are you telling the Americans this directly now? Yes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=73.04s)]
*  What are you saying to them? Are you getting or do you get a sense that you're getting [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=76.16s)]
*  a positive response from them? We have told them this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=80.64s)]
*  I do want to maintain my skepticism. I hope I'm wrong, but I don't believe this heel turn, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=86.32s)]
*  this new permission structure that has been adopted by Western press to more critically [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=96.56s)]
*  examine Israel's actions is actually done for a Jinn in ending this genocide. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=101.84s)]
*  I think that there is something way more nefarious. I'm sorry. I do not trust Donald Trump. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=115.36s)]
*  I do not think that Donald Trump actually gives a single about the Palestinians. And I think he is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  definitely still invested in taking the war to directly to Iran. And I think that this is all [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=130.0s)]
*  just a sham. Okay. That's what I think. I think that a lot of what's going on is a breath of fresh [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=136.64s)]
*  air for a lot of journalists who I do think genuinely wanted to cover Israel with a more [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=145.28s)]
*  critical lens from everything that I've seen from my journalist friends who work at legacy publishers [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=152.16s)]
*  who work in mainstream media. A lot of people see the exact same things that you see, but they are [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=157.2s)]
*  completely locked down through editorial control. And they are they have this inability. So this is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=162.32s)]
*  a moment of permission, an allowance for the media to critically describe what Israel is doing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=169.76s)]
*  in a way that they haven't for the past year and a half, almost two years is going to be. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  And the reality of the matter is, I think all of that is gearing up for something incredibly [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=184.32s)]
*  nefarious. We will know by the end of Trump's Middle East tour. Okay. But with all the reports [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=189.76s)]
*  of troops amassing at the Gaza border and the calls for escalation, I do not believe in Israel's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=198.96s)]
*  bombing campaigns escalating in intensity. Okay. With its targets getting more and more ridiculous, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  the critical coverage from Western press aside feels to me like either Benjamin, there's two [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=216.0s)]
*  options here either Benjamin and Yahoo is trying to get as much bombing out of the way. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=222.32s)]
*  Before he inevitably has to engage in a ceasefire, which was the best possible option, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=228.96s)]
*  or he is going to go back in and reduce Gaza to rubble and engage in the permanent occupation [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=234.72s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip with ethnic displacement coming for the Palestinians, a final solution, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=242.16s)]
*  if you will. And Donald Trump is going to turn around and say, oh, well, you know, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  these guys are October 7, they did October 7, they're all rapist barbarians, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=253.44s)]
*  trusting the Trump administration to do the right thing in this situation is unfortunately [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=258.32s)]
*  the last ditch effort from Hamas. They have no other options. So they're basically doing a hail [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=266.08s)]
*  Mary. Okay. A hail Muhammad, if you will, on relying on Trump being honest when he is an [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=271.52s)]
*  incredibly dishonest person. The bombing the Gaza Strip has been ongoing for three hours without [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=279.92s)]
*  pause with unprecedented intensity as if it's the first day of the war explosion, shake the ground [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=284.4s)]
*  smoke fills the sky and the scene brings back memories of those early days we thought had passed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=288.08s)]
*  Gaza is bleeding once again and the world continues to merely watch. You mean Fatima? Okay, sure. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=292.0s)]
*  I just don't think that a $400 million plan is going to change Trump's analysis on this, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=302.64s)]
*  especially when it's coming from a party that isn't exactly fully invested in the emancipation [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=310.64s)]
*  of Palestinians, definitely more sympathetic to the Palestinian plight as opposed to the rest of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=317.76s)]
*  the Gulf leadership, but still proposal or comprehensive approach, one shot, personal exchange. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  Your hate for Trump is blinding you. You need to have more faith in the resistance. Don't act like [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=330.0s)]
*  the resistance super. You can talk shit about Trump all you want, but if the resistance believes [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=334.48s)]
*  is the best option, I will not doubt them. Hamas isn't powerless. They aren't nobody's chatter. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=337.52s)]
*  I have no faith in America. Okay. It's not about Donald Trump. I have no faith in America [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=343.04s)]
*  and I have eyes and I have ears and I don't rely on artificial intelligence to do my critical [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=350.88s)]
*  thinking for me. And for that reason, I can see the intensity of the bombing campaigns [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  that have been taking place in the backdrop of this Middle Eastern wheeling and dealing that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump is engaging in with all of the Gulf leadership. If they actually had the capacity to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=366.32000000000005s)]
*  grease the wheels hard enough, Trump would have made a phone call to Benjamin Netanyahu by now. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu does not act without American go ahead. I think people are once again, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=378.08s)]
*  failing to recognize the true dynamic here. Okay. Israel and Israeli envoys can dupe dumbass [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=385.84s)]
*  Americans into believing that their incredibly violent actions are the best course of operation [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  here. But at the end of the day, whatever America says goes, if America said on date, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=399.6s)]
*  you're not going to drop another bomb on Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu would turn on, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=404.8s)]
*  we'll go, yes, sir. I'm so sorry about this and then be done with it. Okay. That's it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  Ending the war total withdrawal of the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=415.36s)]
*  Isn't Israel considered one of the greatest security threats, top us Intel threats. Yes, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=417.68s)]
*  it is, but it gets to still be America's most important ally while also being a major [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  security threat because of its strategic positioning. That's it. They, America thinks [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=429.12s)]
*  Israel is the most valuable country in the region in terms of regional domination. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  The same forces listen to what this guy is saying without forceful immigration [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=441.04s)]
*  through the mediators and directly through some persons in the US administrations. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=449.2s)]
*  Sometimes we received a positive response. In other cases, I don't know why, but maybe [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=454.56s)]
*  under the pressure of the Zionist loopy in the American administration, we got more or less [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=463.92s)]
*  negative response. So even today, President Trump has said the following, that he would like to see [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  the United States take Gaza. He said this multiple times now to provide safety for Palestinians, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=478.8s)]
*  maybe in Gaza, maybe outside of Gaza and that Hamas needs to be dealt with. Is this the message [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=487.04s)]
*  that those who are talking to you at the moment from within the administration are conveying back [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=493.04s)]
*  to you? I think first of all, Gaza is belonging to the Palestinians and Palestinians is the only [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  party who can decide for Gaza and for the future of Gazans. No one, neither in the region or [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=506.08s)]
*  outside the region, who can decide for the Palestinians what to do or what not to do. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=512.72s)]
*  We believe in our homeland and we are committed to this homeland and we are ready [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=519.68s)]
*  to pay all the prices to defend our homeland and to also to build a better future for our children [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=526.96s)]
*  on our way. We are not in a market to sell Gaza or not to sell Gaza. We're seeing demonstrations [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=533.6s)]
*  in Gaza. We're seeing people frustrated after 19 months of conflict that Hamas has brought on them. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=540.96s)]
*  Yes, I respect all people who are going to the street to say yes for Hamas or no for Hamas [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=548.16s)]
*  because we have seen half of the Israeli population in the streets against Netanyahu. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=554.64s)]
*  I agree with you on Ms. Rachel at first, but now, but just now my three-year-old was watching her [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=560.64s)]
*  teach him sign language. And the next thing I know he's telling me about how Hitler has some very [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=564.7199999999999s)]
*  beneficial policies. Now I'm wondering what else the right is correct about. Yeah. Ms. Rachel taught [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=568.4799999999999s)]
*  Ms. Rachel is, is doing a teaching my three-year-old dog whistles. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, stop. I'm trying to be serious while I'm listening to you. You hid your midriff. Yes, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=579.12s)]
*  I did. He's I'm fat. There's a thousand people demonstrating against Trump president. We don't [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=584.0s)]
*  see that we are representing all Palestinians. We believe that we are still representing a vast [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=589.2s)]
*  majority of Palestinians. If we go to the heart and the core of what has caused this latest [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  devastation on the Palestinian people, 1920, since 75 years is the cause of all this. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=598.88s)]
*  This is why people actually won't call her a terrorism supporter because she's trying to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=610.0s)]
*  debate Lord reality with a victim of, of Israel's apartheid. Okay. It's akin to bringing up [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=615.44s)]
*  a, a leader of like, I don't know, slave revolt, the slave revolts and, and calling to question [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=626.72s)]
*  the efficacy of the Nat Turner rebellion. Okay. It'd be like, well, you guys did a lot of violent [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  stuff. And he's like, okay, 400 years of chattel slavery. Well, not 400 at that point, but like, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=640.96s)]
*  you know what I mean? It's like having leadership that, that worked to, to resist against Nazis [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=645.9200000000001s)]
*  during the Warsaw ghetto uprising and then calling into question their methods and call it and, and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  literally, literally debating them to be like, okay, sorry. I saw a Nazi dog was holding the chat [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=659.84s)]
*  immediately at the club. Yeah. On knock but day two. Yeah. Don't you think Nazi Germany has a [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=667.6s)]
*  right to defend itself after the Warsaw ghetto uprising? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=673.68s)]
*  As a result, October 6, a lot of Palestinians were killed. We have before October 60,000 people in [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=678.88s)]
*  the space of 20 months. Okay. Between 2000 and because of October 7 and the, Oh my God, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=685.68s)]
*  that is because of October 7, Israel's a natural force and unstoppable. Israel's a Typhoon. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=694.0s)]
*  Okay. Israel's the alpha and the Omega. They are everything and nothing all at once. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=701.28s)]
*  Israel is an immovable object. It's because of October 7 that Israel had to kill 60,000 Palestinians, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=707.6s)]
*  many of which were women and children. You don't understand. No the fuck. It wasn't. What do you [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  mean? Why is Israel all of a sudden not a nation state that is directed by people with, with this, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=720.32s)]
*  this extermination is motivation. She's well informed on this. I don't know why she feels [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=732.0s)]
*  the need to do this. You can't do this. You can't interview Hamas without fucking asking Hamas to [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=736.4000000000001s)]
*  condemn Hamas. Let's be real. It's so fucking stupid. It's so disrespectful. It's so insane. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=740.24s)]
*  Okay. Straight up. This isn't journalism. It's propaganda. Doing this to an Israeli official [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=747.2s)]
*  is journalism because Israel holds all the power. Israel is the foreign ally here. Israel's supposed [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=754.08s)]

*  consistently in the wrong. Okay. Throughout fucking history. What are we talking about? It's a settler [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=765.0400000000001s)]
*  colonial apartheid state that is conducting a fucking genocide, turning around and being like, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=771.12s)]
*  well, you brought this about, you brought this genocide about to your own population [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=776.64s)]
*  is a way to move the responsibility away from the fucking genocide errors. Are you out of your [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=781.52s)]
*  goddamn mind? Are you insane? Israel's the one that's fucking doing the genocide. What do you mean? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=787.6s)]
*  Fuck me. They will not stop until their hostages are released until Hamas disarms itself and says [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  that it no longer wishes to be the governing power. Why not? First of all, again, as a cube, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=800.72s)]
*  occupied people, we have all the right to resist the occupation by all means, including [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=805.36s)]
*  under resistance. So you won't, you won't disarm. Let me continue. If you ask someone to be this [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=809.52s)]
*  armed, it has to be the Israelis who have all the power, the chemical power, the nuclear power, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=815.28s)]
*  the biological power and all the support from the West, including the Americans to destroy [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=820.08s)]
*  the Palestinian life. Like what we have seen along the 17 months. That you still have 50 or so of [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=826.48s)]

*  really read history, then it goes back more than 2000 years. Brother, if you go back more than 2000 [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=838.64s)]
*  years, you will recognize that the Palestinians that are being fucking slaughtered right now [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=844.0s)]

*  back 2000 years. Who gives a fuck? Those are the people that remained in the region. Some of them [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=861.28s)]
*  converted to Christianity and some of them reverted to Islam after, but okay. They're their fucking [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=867.36s)]
*  ancestors. Then they are the indigenous population there. What an incredibly stupid fucking attitude [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=873.04s)]
*  to have by your logic. USA has dumb bass. People ever write the gun down Americans and that American [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=879.04s)]

*  the same principle behind fucking 9 11. The act in and of itself is brought about due to America's [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=891.4399999999999s)]
*  arming and training and radicalizing of the Mujahideen. But of course, the act in and of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=899.28s)]
*  itself is an act of terror where 3000 civilians fucking got slaughtered in the Twin Towers. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=904.4s)]
*  Okay. I don't think it's appropriate or good. You dumb fuck. And the same thing goes for October 7 [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  either. But if you want to actually resolve conflict, if you want to make sure that there is [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=917.2s)]
*  no October 7 that happens ever again, you have two options. You either ethnically cleanse the entire [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=921.2s)]
*  Palestinian population, which I'm sure you are actually on board with no matter how much you [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  fucking say that's not the case. Then why do you want to go to 80 years ago? Wait, so you agree with [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=930.32s)]
*  me that Israel's slaughtering its own ancestors now? Is that what you're saying? The fuck do you [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=935.44s)]
*  mean? Why do I want to go 80 years ago? Because that's when the Nakba happened or not 80 years ago, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=940.24s)]
*  77 years 76 years ago. Fuck. I'm nope. 77 years ago is when the Nakba happened. Your inability to [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=946.32s)]

*  the most common and perhaps one of the most idiotic arguments that Israel defenders like [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=960.88s)]
*  to present where they go, well, if you go back 2000 years ago, if you go back 3000 years ago, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=968.56s)]
*  Jews were there actually, historically. Okay. And the ones that were Jews then converted to [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=974.8s)]
*  Christianity and stayed there. And then they converted the fucking Islam. Some of those guys [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=981.4399999999999s)]
*  are still there. Those are the ancestors. And quit calling others idiot when you don't know [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=987.44s)]
*  the other person's view. I know your fucking worldview. You are a disgusting little repulsive [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=992.08s)]
*  Nazi freak for trying to justify ongoing genocide by saying, well, 3000 years ago, Jews were there. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=998.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay, dude. What a fucking idiotic argument. How was this? Like, how is even remotely appropriate? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1005.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay, well, you know, Russia has a right to ethnically cleanse the entirety of Ukraine, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1012.48s)]
*  I guess. You know, you don't even have to go back fucking 3000 years to name calling classic [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1016.8000000000001s)]

*  that. Okay. You are the reason it's people like you that are so repulsive and, and unironically [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1027.76s)]
*  project every step of the fucking way where they go, Oh, your inability to comprehend my argument. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1034.08s)]
*  You are the reason you are literally creating a fresh crop of fucking neo-Nazis who not only [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1038.48s)]
*  don't like Israel, but they also don't like Jews. Okay. You are the fucking reason immediately [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1045.52s)]

*  you arrived at evolution. I know it's just fucking so stupid. Very relevant short interview about [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1056.64s)]
*  2000 years ago. What? This is very good question. And that would be for you. Nice story about it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1061.2800000000002s)]

*  I think that chatter was drawn in comparison between Palestinians and native Americans. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1087.6s)]
*  No, he was trying to draw a comparison. At first he was trying to draw a comparison between [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1092.0s)]
*  Palestinians and native Americans. And then he quickly substituted that to make a comparison [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1095.84s)]
*  between native Americans and Israelis. Okay. That's the, the problem is he's not invested in [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1100.08s)]
*  like actually arriving at the truth. Okay. No wonder the majority of population disagrees with [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1106.0s)]
*  you. You think the majority of the population, wait, you think the majority of the population [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1112.1599999999999s)]

*  Israelis were natives too? No, the fuck they aren't. The current Israelis, if you want to [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1126.08s)]
*  consider natives, okay, the current Israelis are not fucking natives. It started with a settler [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1130.72s)]
*  colonial operation by, oh my God, it started with a settler colonial operation after the Balfour [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1137.52s)]
*  declaration. Okay. It was a violent enterprise through and through the idea that they were [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1143.52s)]
*  fucking natives at that point is ridiculous. Then words don't mean anything. Okay. They are [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1148.72s)]
*  settler occupiers. You keep trying to go, they were driven off. Okay. And the ones that remained [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1152.64s)]
*  are the ones Israel is killing. Who was more native to the land then? The Palestinians are [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1158.72s)]
*  both by way of living there at the inception of the Israeli nation state, which happened with [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1163.92s)]
*  ethnic cleansing and forcible displacement of 750,000 Palestinians from their ancestral homes [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1170.0s)]

*  from Gaza inside of Israel proper for that fucking reason. Okay. The idea that you want to go back [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1181.2s)]
*  to 3000 years while also simultaneously refusing to recognize that the ones that remain literally [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1186.72s)]

*  of your house and my kids and then your kids come back as your kids moved out. What? You're describing [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1199.76s)]
*  the concept of what Israel did to the Palestinians right now. How are you so fucking oblivious to the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1205.04s)]
*  reality? What do you mean? Classic fucking Hosbrust, dude. Classic Hosbrust. Jews were driven out by [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1210.32s)]
*  who? The Palestinians? No, they were the Jews at that point. Okay. The ones that fucking remained. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1218.6399999999999s)]
*  This is the same moronic talking point where it's like, well, the Holocaust happened. What were the [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1226.56s)]
*  Jews supposed to do? I don't know. Don't do fucking ethnic cleansing to a totally random group of [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1230.96s)]
*  indigenous people that didn't deserve it. Don't you think that's a little inappropriate? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1235.28s)]
*  You're a fucking freak. Everyone, everything that has happened to Jewish people, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1240.72s)]
*  historic atrocities that took place against Jewish people, all of that is now in service of [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1247.9199999999998s)]
*  Israel doing ethnic cleansing to the fucking Palestinians. How does this work? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1255.52s)]
*  I'm talking about the Ottoman. You think the Ottoman drove out the Jews? Are you fucking stupid? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1259.36s)]
*  Oh my God. Okay. Dude, you don't know anything. I don't know how to have a fucking normal [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1265.36s)]
*  conversation with you. You are so stupid. The Ottoman drove Jews off the- Go ask Grok [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1269.76s)]
*  if the opposite is correct and the truth will shock you. It's the other way around, you fucking [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1276.8s)]
*  moron. Christians drove Jews off from Europe to the Ottoman Empire, which was seen as a safe haven [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1282.72s)]
*  at the time. Pre Balfour Declaration, the Jews that lived in the Mena region [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1292.72s)]
*  and the entirety of the Levant were there under the protectorate of the Ottoman Empire. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1300.72s)]
*  They were welcomed into the Ottoman Empire. You are wrong. You are just entirely wrong. You are [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1307.44s)]
*  such a fucking Eurocuck, which once again, reconfirms the entire Western backed settler [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1315.84s)]
*  colonial enterprise that plays a formative role in building out Zionism. The notion that it's [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1323.6799999999998s)]
*  actually not the Christians that did historic pogroms, including the fucking Holocaust. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1331.84s)]
*  And it's actually somehow the responsibility of the fucking Arabs that did not partake in this [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1337.12s)]
*  at all. As a matter of fact, 11,000 Palestinians died during World War II, fighting against Nazi [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1343.2s)]
*  Germany. Grok agrees with you. We're not doing this even as a joke. I'm not even going to entertain [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1351.6000000000001s)]
*  it. Stop. I was fucking- I jokingly referred to it, but- It is in your power to release them. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1357.2s)]
*  If Hamas hands the hostages over, if they disarm and they basically disappear from Gaza, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1364.64s)]
*  they will end this conflict. Is that something that Hamas is willing to do? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1370.96s)]
*  We are ready to go for one session to release all the captured Israelis and return to get some [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1374.72s)]
*  of our prisoners, but with the guarantees that we are going to reach an end of this war, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1381.8400000000001s)]
*  total withdrawal of the Israeli forces. If the Americans ask you to disarm, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1388.32s)]
*  step away from power, you are willing to do this tomorrow, including handing over all of the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1392.56s)]
*  hostages. But if the Americans ask you- It's so crazy. Oh, are you ready to fucking release [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1397.28s)]
*  all the hostages? Yeah, no shit. Yeah, they have been. They've said it a million times over. They [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1418.6399999999999s)]
*  said it on 39 separate occasions. Like a couple months ago, it was 39. I don't know how many times [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1426.48s)]
*  it's been since then. Benjamin Netanyahu, on the other hand, as recently as last week was like, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1431.52s)]
*  yeah, even if they release all the hostages, we're not ending this war. We want to fucking [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1436.72s)]
*  eradicate this strip. What? This whole chat on a watch list. Well, you're in the chat. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1439.76s)]
*  Again, to hand over the government immediately if we reach an end of this war. And we have accepted, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1444.56s)]
*  by the way, the Egyptian proposal, which is talking about forming a Palestinian and independent, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1450.96s)]
*  non-affiliated body, politically not an unaffiliated body, to run Gaza Strip. But when it comes to [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1456.96s)]
*  disarmament, I think, yes, we are ready to be disarmed. In one case, we have our independent [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1463.6000000000001s)]
*  self-sovereign state. If we can get it peacefully, politically, through- based on international [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1469.04s)]
*  rules and regulations and law, yes, we are ready to do it. But again, this will happen only when [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1475.28s)]
*  we have our independent self-sovereign state. Before that, as long as we are still occupied [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbMLcyJGTI&t=1481.92s)]
