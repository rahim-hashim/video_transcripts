# Exposing Controversies In The Streaming Community | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU)
*  Basically, he will write this ridiculous statement or make a YouTube video and then he'll start [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=0.0s)]
*  going after everyone who has like called him out and bully them and behave in a belligerent [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=7.98s)]
*  matter and try to present them as like bad people with ill intentions and not literal [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  victims and then his fan base will also go along with it and they'll badger and bully [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=18.8s)]
*  and pester every single person and engaging character assassination of every single party [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=24.12s)]
*  involved executive order review and more get in now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=28.08s)]
*  How does it feel seeing this? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=41.28s)]
*  Do you go down? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=42.28s)]
*  It's got to be kind of cathartic to see his behavior finally be exposed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=43.28s)]
*  No, I mean, he's been doing this in perpetuity. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=46.32s)]
*  I mean, he had a, I think he had similar issues in the past as well for many, many years. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  I think his fan base doesn't care. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  I think they'll act like they're very critical of him and then repackage it as like old drama [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=60.92s)]
*  later down the line. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=65.92s)]
*  It's usually a very simple method. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=67.6s)]
*  Destiny does something that is like overtly hypocritical, incredibly immoral and very [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=69.8s)]
*  wrong. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=75.0s)]
*  People, some people in his community get mad at him and they criticize him in his own fan [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=76.0s)]
*  base. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=79.88s)]
*  Destiny goes through and deletes all of those messages and punishes every single person [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=80.96s)]
*  that is a naysayer. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=85.12s)]
*  But he does it also quietly, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=86.48s)]
*  And then he'll write this long, well thought out, brilliant debate where he basically will [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  pick apart the arguments, the counter arguments by hyper focusing on some of the silliest [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=96.04s)]
*  things that people are saying or directly engaging character assassination without addressing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=100.56s)]
*  the actual wrongdoing whatsoever. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=105.92s)]
*  And then everyone in his fan base will have the talking points that they're now armed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=108.92s)]
*  with as they go feral and make every single naysayer's life a living hell. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=112.84s)]
*  OK, that is what they do. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=118.52s)]
*  And then later down the line, they will essentially claim this was just old drama anyway, and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=121.12s)]
*  they'll package it and they'll silence it for this story in particular. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=126.48s)]
*  It seems like like it was one of the things that I couldn't understand because everyone [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=131.16s)]
*  was talking about like Nick Fuentes potentially getting his talk by destiny and he was joking [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=135.0s)]
*  about that as well. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=140.28s)]
*  And and everyone was talking about that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=141.44s)]
*  But I was like, it's weird that I think it's kind of odd that he's like made, you know, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=143.64s)]
*  his ex-wife that he was sending to random people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  I doubt his ex-wife would be on board with that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=150.92s)]
*  And it turns out that there were plenty of other people who were also not on board with [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  him sending those videos to random people that he wants to fuck. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=156.76s)]
*  And and it's, you know, it's real epstiny behavior, OK, using his using his orbiters [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=159.84s)]
*  to go out and also cut side deals with the people that he's wronged and to try to squash [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=169.0s)]
*  this in its entirety as quietly as he possibly can while he continues doing whatever the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=176.16s)]
*  fuck he's doing. Yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=181.28s)]
*  Sending out resumes. Exactly. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=182.8s)]
*  This isn't the first time he's done it nor the second or the third. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=184.8s)]
*  He's called he's been called out literally four times for this exact thing over the years. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=186.84s)]
*  Yeah. So he's been doing it nonstop. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=190.44s)]
*  It seemingly he hasn't stopped. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=193.72s)]
*  And I think I think that basically he will write this ridiculous statement or make a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=195.92s)]
*  YouTube video and then he'll start going after everyone who has like called him out and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=204.72s)]
*  bully them and behave in a belligerent manner and try to present them as like bad people [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=209.48s)]
*  with ill intentions and not literal victims. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=214.84s)]
*  And then his fan base will also go along with it and they'll badger and bully and pester [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  every single person and engaging character assassination of every single party involved. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=222.8s)]
*  And then inevitably, inevitably, his his orbiters will come back because they all love that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=227.28s)]
*  clout and he'll just continue. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Maybe he'll lose a little bit of his fan base in the process, but then he'll just keep on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  keeping on. He'll just keep doing the same over and over again. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  And it will be considered past drama and that you're stupid for addressing it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=245.24s)]
*  That's something that he has done in perpetuity over and over again. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=250.6s)]
*  It's not the first time. It's not the second time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=254.88s)]
*  It's like the fourth time this particular thing has happened and many other awful things [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=257.04s)]
*  have happened in the process as well. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=261.44s)]
*  And he just always seems to get away with it because his fan base doesn't give a sh**. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=263.0s)]
*  His fan base does not care at the end of the day. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=267.16s)]
*  Like they'll use the initial criticisms that some people in his subreddit are launching [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=270.64s)]
*  against him to say, look, his fan base is not that sycophantic. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=277.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, he's just always whipping the ranks behind the scenes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=280.52s)]
*  You look like a fried sunflower. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=284.96s)]
*  Thank you. I guess nothing like a streamer to tell us is very important. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=286.84s)]
*  Billion, a very important opinion. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=290.8s)]
*  You hate billionaires while being a millionaire. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=292.6s)]
*  Chill already, bro. Wait, what? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  Welcome to the echo chamber. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=295.64s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=297.32s)]
*  What are you in here? What's echoing? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=298.6s)]
*  Yeah. He had a so-called feminist being Gisley Maxwell for him. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=300.8s)]
*  It's insane. Yeah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=306.68s)]
*  Isn't it that erudite girl who also hates me as well? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=307.52s)]
*  I think that's what I've heard that she was the person intercepting the people that were like wronged by him. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=311.24s)]
*  Anyway, let's blast off. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=320.64s)]
*  She's always tweeting about you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=323.2s)]
*  Yeah, she's also that's the pro-Israel girl, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=324.76s)]
*  The South African one who I think his family moved to Israel or something from South Africa. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=328.0s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=333.68s)]
*  I'm not entirely certain on her background at all. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=335.08s)]
*  I don't know. Wait, that's a different girl. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=338.12s)]
*  Oh, that's South African aristocracy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=340.2s)]
*  That's a different girl. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=342.88s)]
*  There's a different one. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=343.88s)]
*  Dude, all of these people that are destiny orbiters, they all hate me because that's like the one consistent, coherent worldview position that that community has. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=344.96s)]
*  Destiny will take literally both conflicting sides in every single argument, and they will follow him to every single argument like that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=355.28s)]
*  But there's one thing that has not changed over the past five years, and that is focus on everything in the world that's bad is because of a song. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  And virtually all of his orbiters will assume all of his positions in real time and start like repeating. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=371.36s)]
*  It's like a cult. I don't know how to describe it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a cult. OK, that's it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=382.04s)]
*  It's literally a gross, sweaty, weird sculpt where they, I assume, like band nerds debate stuff and then have weird sex. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=384.36s)]
*  OK, it's not it's not aristocracy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=394.24s)]
*  It's a different person. OK, my bad. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  It's not. What is it? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=399.76s)]
*  I apologize. I thought there's too many orbiters to keep up. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=401.0s)]
*  I was wrong. I mixed up the people that destiny is linked up with. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=405.24s)]
*  They all also hate me anyway. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=412.2s)]
*  Erudite said like Dr. Oz Erudite is his podcast co-host. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=414.56s)]
*  OK, yeah, he's like Nixxiom, but also their primary output instead of instead of like making self-help content. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=419.24s)]
*  They make like debate stuff. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=428.4s)]
*  Not so erudite is the Gis Lane Maxwell. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=430.12s)]
*  Oh, not so erudite is the is the Gis Lane Maxwell. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=432.36s)]
*  Got it. The take economy is booming. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4HkdEZfGU&t=435.52s)]
