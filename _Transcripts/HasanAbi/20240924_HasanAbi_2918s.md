# Streaming is Changing Politics...Is That A Good Thing? | Hasanabi Reacts to Wisecrack
**HasanAbi:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI)
*  If there is no democratization of the dissemination of information, you don't get to have a different [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=0.0s)]
*  point of view on Israel, right? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=6.86s)]
*  If you look at CNN, if you look at New York Times and you get all your news from there, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=8.4s)]
*  you are going to have a very different point of view on what is occurring and why it's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=12.5s)]
*  happening, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=18.96s)]
*  Streaming is changing politics. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=25.82s)]
*  Is that a good thing? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=26.82s)]
*  I will be covering this one now as we move on to less depressing stories. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=28.26s)]
*  I'm not going to do the Jubilee tonight. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=32.86s)]
*  I'll do it tomorrow. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=35.02s)]
*  This is a fun story. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=36.02s)]
*  This apparently glazes me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=37.02s)]
*  Israel's warning is one of the most significant geopolitical events of the 21st century. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=38.02s)]
*  So why is this guy one of the internet's leading commentators on the issue? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=43.18s)]
*  Oh, that's an argument for incest never considered. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=47.58s)]
*  For those of you who missed it, Destiny, who is a streamer, debated political scientists [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=49.660000000000004s)]
*  and Israel-Palestine scholar Norman Finkelstein. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  And in doing so, he presented himself as an expert on [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=56.78s)]
*  Those kids were literally coming out of a previously identified [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=59.46s)]
*  You're a Mr. Borelli. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=62.1s)]
*  With all due respect, you're such a fantastic moron. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=65.1s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  You know, later he went on and talked about how he absolutely dominated that debate. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  If the other side doesn't bring up a single coherent point from the entire conversation, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=76.14s)]
*  which they didn't, and they're like being unhinged the entire time, I feel like hopefully [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=79.5s)]
*  it plays better to me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=83.7s)]
*  I definitely could have gone. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=84.7s)]
*  I definitely could have gone harder, though, given how unhinged norm was. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=85.7s)]
*  And then the most important Mr. Portobello, you are such a fantastical moron. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=89.78s)]
*  It's still funny. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=96.3s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=97.3s)]
*  That was so great, dude. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=99.3s)]
*  The gall, dude, thinking that you go up against the dude who wrote the goddamn books because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=102.22s)]
*  You tried to quickly summarize a couple Wikipedia articles that correspond to your argument. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=108.42s)]
*  The arrogance, dude, that arrogance and that blind confidence is exactly how he motivates [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=117.38s)]
*  some of the most like ill-equipped people online. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=122.22s)]
*  Some of the most like awful individuals online into believing that he has ideas worth a damn. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=125.9s)]
*  Election of our lifetime. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=132.66s)]
*  Why is Donald Trump doing a live stream with Aiden Ross? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=134.38s)]
*  And for that matter, why is one of the most incisive voices on the left not a host at [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=137.9s)]
*  MSNBC or CNN, but a Twitch streamer? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=143.38s)]
*  You know, Hassan Piker's critiques of liberal policies from within his streaming suite at [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=146.38s)]
*  the DNC apparently got him kicked out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=151.66s)]
*  I doubt that, you know, NBC would be getting kicked out randomly. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=154.3s)]
*  Which is cool. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=158.62s)]
*  I'll be honest, guys. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=159.62s)]
*  In general, it's cool to get kicked out of places. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=160.62s)]
*  It's a cool badge of honor unless you get kicked out for like a not good reason. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=163.02s)]
*  Live streamers have become important enough in the political space that they can seemingly [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=167.7s)]
*  change minds, influence elections, and maybe even threaten major political parties. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=171.38s)]
*  So how did folks like this go from streaming Grand Theft Auto V all day to reshaping our [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  political discourse? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=180.61999999999998s)]
*  And are they making a meaningful difference or just enabling a sort of digital cosplay [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  that lets us feel like we're activists when we're just sort of fueling Jeff Bezos' empire? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=186.94s)]
*  Jeff Bezos. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=192.82s)]
*  Worst bald man alive. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=193.82s)]
*  Use my mind in the comments if you think there's a worst bald guy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  To understand political streaming, we got to start by contextualizing the seemingly [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=198.66s)]
*  unpolitical world of video game streaming. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=202.78s)]
*  Because before these guys were interviewing world leaders, most of them were just streaming [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=205.5s)]
*  games from their bedrooms. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=209.26s)]
*  And they all started over on Twitch, which is an Amazon-owned platform catering to gamers [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=211.06s)]
*  and their fans. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=215.66s)]
*  And since Twitch took off, you know, some streamers have... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=216.66s)]
*  It almost sounds like you did nothing but play games and all of a sudden we're politics, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=218.9s)]
*  man. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=222.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't really care. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=223.1s)]
*  It's not... not exactly correct, but who cares? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=224.5s)]
*  Over to competitors like Kick and pathetic, gross, lame boomers continue to stream here [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=227.1s)]
*  on YouTube. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=233.14s)]
*  I'm Michael Burns. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=234.14s)]
*  I'm here with producer Henry. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=235.14s)]
*  Now, one distinguishing aspect of streaming relative to other types of media is its shocking [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=236.14s)]
*  sense of immediacy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=240.7s)]
*  Now, streamers are playing and reacting in real time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=242.1s)]
*  And simultaneously, their viewers are commenting and maybe even critiquing them in the chat. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=245.54s)]
*  Go to your Twitch dashboard and check out the new charity function. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=249.94s)]
*  It makes easier for your chat to donate to charity and doesn't cost you anything. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=252.94s)]
*  Okay, I'm not doing that right now because we're in the middle of something right now. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=256.34s)]
*  I don't know if you can tell, but what I'll do... thank you for letting me know. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=259.54s)]
*  But all right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=262.38s)]
*  It's a format that leads to heightened reactions and lots of hot takes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=263.38s)]
*  This might be the most transphobic thing that I've ever said in my life. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=267.5s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=270.82s)]
*  I don't think I really believe in non-binary. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=272.02s)]
*  And unlike traditional media, YouTube videos or podcasts, when users react to or, you know, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=274.34s)]
*  I mean, if you can yell at streamers, well, streamers can yell back. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=279.78s)]
*  It's like, how the f*** do you arrive at that position while playing one of the most like [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=282.38s)]
*  pro trans video games too? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=286.5s)]
*  Like, like what is wrong with this man, dude? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=288.85999999999996s)]
*  His mind is just constantly churning out as much hatred as he possibly can come up with. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=292.26s)]
*  Like how the f***? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=297.5s)]
*  Which offers a thrill and attention that's only available in such an immediate format. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=298.5s)]
*  I mean, imagine if you could yell at Rachel Maddow and she could yell back and call you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  a dirty little incel. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=307.82s)]
*  I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=309.42s)]
*  But this sense of immediacy isn't just fun or kind of thrilling. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=311.22s)]
*  It actually has the potential to shift how we relate to each other on a societal level. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  Scholar Yochai Benkler argues that social media democratizes communication by providing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=323.06s)]
*  direct and unmediated access to information and discourse. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=329.22s)]
*  As he sees it, digital networks allow for a genuine reorganization of the public sphere [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  by weakening the power of commercial mass media and its owners and providing an avenue [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=338.94s)]
*  for diverse and politically mobilized communication that's less corruptible by money than traditional [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=343.1s)]
*  mass media. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=349.38s)]
*  Now in fairness, that was written in 2006 before a world where a bunch of cool countercultural [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=350.38s)]
*  free-thinking streamers like Tim Pool got paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by Russians [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=356.94s)]
*  to say stuff on their streams. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=361.58000000000004s)]
*  Not very cool and countercultural, is it, Timothy? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=364.1s)]
*  But I would say that if any of you, if any of the Russians are watching this, seriously, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=368.18s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=372.58s)]
*  Let's get involved. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=373.58s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=374.58s)]
*  Let's do the thing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=375.58s)]
*  I would do it for so much less, like a disgusting amount less. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=376.58s)]
*  I saw how much you paid Tim Pool. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=380.14s)]
*  One one thousandth of that and I'll be here praising Putin. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=382.58s)]
*  I'll get a Putin neck tattoo. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=386.94s)]
*  I'll get a Putin lower back tattoo that says, tootin' for Putin that will maybe jiggle when [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=388.26s)]
*  I fart. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=393.42s)]
*  Shadowy sponsors aside, for Benkler, the decentralization and democratization of information flow makes [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=394.42s)]
*  the public sphere more inclusive and participatory, providing a platform for non-market, peer-produced [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=400.58000000000004s)]
*  sources of filtration and accreditation. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  And this really helps alleviate information overload while also serving as a counterbalance [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=409.18s)]
*  to the concentrated power of traditional media. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=413.18s)]
*  You can think about it this way, like the best things you've probably watched on the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=415.26s)]
*  internet are because your friends were sharing them over and over or a Reddit community you're [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=418.38s)]
*  part of told you to watch it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=422.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=424.46s)]
*  It's not because some traditional media source was like, please watch the new Connor O'Malley [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=425.46s)]
*  video. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  It's called Cory's and it's a weird exploration of the way our identity split under late. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=430.53999999999996s)]

*  God damn, Connor O'Malley is so good. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=437.02s)]
*  Capitalism and the way that social media exacerbates those tensions, right? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=439.14s)]
*  It was just your friend was like, check out the new O'Malley video. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=442.29999999999995s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=445.17999999999995s)]
*  Now, this all empowers viewers to contribute to public debate and hold those in power accountable. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=446.17999999999995s)]
*  In the context of political streaming, viewers are able to form communities with other audience [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=451.9s)]
*  members that can exist in the chat, on Discord servers and social media or hey, even real [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=456.62s)]
*  life. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=461.26s)]
*  And please let us know if you ever met a stream friend in real life. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=462.26s)]
*  Also, if you met a stream friend in real life and you're currently handcuffed to a radiator [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=465.17999999999995s)]
*  in their basement, but you can kind of reach the keyboard, I guess type help and we'll [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=470.09999999999997s)]
*  try to find you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=474.46s)]
*  But it's not just immediacy and community that make political streaming so unique. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=475.46s)]
*  Christopher J Hop would suggest that the ability of platforms like Twitch to enable [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=480.14s)]
*  the sharing of unfiltered thoughts and experiences in real time helps facilitate the expression [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=484.41999999999996s)]
*  of realness. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=489.94s)]
*  This is something I think about quite a bit, which is like the democratization of media [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=490.94s)]
*  has led to people like myself existing in this space, but it also has very obvious downsides [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=499.62s)]
*  to it as well. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=507.94s)]
*  I guess like if misinformation is going to occur, it's better if it's democratized, but [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=509.1s)]
*  also it does kind of feel as though with less and less confidence in mainstream media, there [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=515.0600000000001s)]
*  are instances, there are definitely instances where like misinformation presented by grifters [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=524.5s)]
*  can cause societal can push for societal collapse like especially when paired up with the lack [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=532.1800000000001s)]
*  of education, lack of critical thinking, lack of media literacy. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=538.82s)]
*  So it's something that I think about quite a bit because if the media is not, if there [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=541.9000000000001s)]
*  is no independent media, if there is no democratization of the dissemination of information, you don't [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=547.94s)]
*  get to have a different point of view on Israel, right? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=555.1800000000001s)]
*  If you look at CNN, if you look at New York Times and you get all your news from there, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=557.6600000000001s)]
*  you are going to have a very different point of view on what is occurring and why it's [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=561.7800000000001s)]
*  happening, right? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=568.62s)]
*  So someone like myself will never be able to exist in that space. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=569.62s)]
*  There will never be the gratuitous nature of like corporate overlords that say, you [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=572.7s)]
*  know what, we want this kind of information to be out there as well. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=578.5s)]
*  That's not going to happen, right? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=581.46s)]
*  They're always going to limit that to the neat little confines of whatever neoliberal [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=583.08s)]
*  hegemony allows you to say. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=586.82s)]
*  Now there is no extent to the right wing. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=589.98s)]
*  There's no limitation to like how far right you can go unless you are also, you can be, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=593.34s)]
*  but you can't be right. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=599.38s)]
*  You can be and get a prominent role in a media institution. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=600.7s)]
*  You can't be and also at the same time, however. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=604.32s)]
*  And on the other hand, on the other hand, there's a lot of people like, there's a lot [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=608.32s)]
*  of people due to the fact that legacy papers have kind of dropped the ball time and time [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=614.02s)]
*  again, in a very public fashion where where mainstream media is like whenever, whenever [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=618.98s)]
*  mainstream media is needed, like during COVID, right? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=625.1s)]
*  When there needs to be like an organized way to disseminate information from an institution, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=630.1s)]
*  Institute of Authority, like during COVID, when there is a serious pandemic occurring, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=635.86s)]
*  right? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=642.82s)]
*  Because there are less and less people trusting mainstream resources, a lot of people can [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=645.1s)]
*  take advantage of that lack of trust and, you know, grift, make up, especially in times [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=650.82s)]
*  of commotion. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=659.2600000000001s)]
*  It's a weird predicament that I find myself both benefiting from, but also thinking is [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=660.1800000000001s)]
*  maybe sometimes consequential in a negative way. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=667.62s)]
*  Like COVID probably caused a lot more people to distrust mainstream institutions, which [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=671.26s)]
*  is ironic because they didn't really help that badly during COVID. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=679.46s)]
*  Like they were doing best practices on the issue of COVID and their coverage over COVID [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=683.9s)]
*  and trying to stop misinformation from spreading during COVID. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=689.74s)]
*  But also you look at Israel and the way that they're dealing with American foreign policy, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=693.8199999999999s)]
*  they always cover American foreign policy in the exact way that you expect them to cover, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=699.1s)]
*  which is a crumb of truthfulness in an effort to maintain the veneer of impartiality so [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=705.62s)]
*  that you can be a legitimate institution that is trusted, OK, while simultaneously packing [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=712.22s)]
*  it to the gills with a tremendous amount of misinformation, lying by omission, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=717.78s)]
*  genuinely using passive voice whenever you describe Israel's atrocities, things of that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=724.46s)]
*  nature, all of Israel's enemies are terrorists that deserve it, that kind of stuff. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=729.1800000000001s)]
*  Also, in my opinion, that kind of framing, in my opinion, also caused a lot of people, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=732.86s)]
*  especially in the younger generations, to mistrust mainstream media, mainstream institutions. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=737.94s)]
*  And I think we need to rebuild trust in mainstream institutions because I believe that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=743.1800000000001s)]
*  there still should be real journalism happening. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=747.6600000000001s)]
*  Mainstream media spreads plenty of disinformation on its own, but I feel as though [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=750.9s)]
*  mainstream media has pushed back from independent media. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=754.06s)]
*  Independent media gets less pushback from other independent media because its reach is [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=755.74s)]
*  simply smaller. Rebuild trust in US mainstream institutions. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=759.06s)]
*  Lol. Yes. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=762.4599999999999s)]
*  Yes, there should be. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=764.4599999999999s)]
*  In a perfect world, in a perfect world, independent institutions would exist, but you [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=766.66s)]
*  would also have, you would also have like legitimate national institutions that are [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=771.5799999999999s)]
*  trustworthy resources for objective or at least as close to objective news as you can get. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=778.26s)]
*  But the unfortunate reality is that America, due to the interest of, of, you know, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=784.8199999999999s)]
*  capital accumulators, is never going to do that, I think. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=791.62s)]
*  While we're at it, rebuild trust in government. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=796.62s)]
*  I agree with that, too. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=798.38s)]
*  I literally agree with that as well. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=799.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=801.86s)]
*  The idea that, you know, streamers seem to have an authenticity that we don't normally [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=802.62s)]
*  see in popular media figures. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=806.9399999999999s)]
*  Hopwood and his co-authors argue that realness may be a particularly important individual [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=808.62s)]
*  difference variable within certain domains. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=814.06s)]
*  Being real may be both harmful and beneficial for politicians, but for citizens, it is a [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=816.3s)]
*  key characteristic of trust. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=821.9399999999999s)]
*  It's basically like when streamers seem like, like a cool person to hang out with, like [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=824.38s)]
*  how I'm a cool person to hang out with, you know, I trust them more intuitively than I [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=829.42s)]
*  would some good looking guy on TV with a slick haircut, a nice suit, and he always says the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=832.86s)]
*  right thing, you know, screw that guy. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=838.1400000000001s)]
*  Now, some of this is simply a function of streamers broadcasting for huge amounts of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=840.4200000000001s)]
*  time. Seriously, if you're not familiar with. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=845.5s)]
*  I mean, it's virtually impossible for me to be fake. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=847.5400000000001s)]
*  No one is that good at presenting a fake version of themselves for eight to ten hours [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=850.22s)]
*  every single day. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=856.0600000000001s)]
*  This sort of thing. You know, Piker will stream for 12 hours a day. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=857.1400000000001s)]
*  Destiny might stream for seven hours a day. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=860.78s)]
*  People like Vosh might go five, six hours a day. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=863.1s)]
*  And when you're streaming for, you know, most of your waking life, you're going to have to [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=865.9399999999999s)]
*  talk about more than just politics and theory. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=869.8199999999999s)]
*  Graveler is a rock with four arms and pass. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=872.26s)]
*  I'm not putting my anywhere near gravel. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=875.86s)]
*  Now, it seems like the relatability and realness is paying off. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=878.62s)]
*  Piker alone has over two million and five hundred thousand followers and one hundred [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=881.98s)]
*  and forty million views with an average of one hundred and fifty seven thousand active [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=887.62s)]
*  viewers. I know for a fact that's over twice the population of Duluth, Minnesota. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=892.4200000000001s)]
*  So at any point he's streaming, there are two Duluths watching him. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=897.9000000000001s)]
*  Now, during the 2020 elections, his was the Duluth Dyson times two. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=903.0200000000001s)]
*  When you think about that, when you think about that, that means there's not one but two [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=908.38s)]
*  Larry Sinclair's sucking two different Obamas after doing crack sideways, sucking their [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=912.62s)]

*  The average is similar audience size to CBS and Fox News. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=921.54s)]
*  And this seems to indicate that at least amongst a younger demographic, folks prefer more [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=924.86s)]
*  interactive and authentic content. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=929.42s)]
*  And this has not escaped the attention of mainstream media. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=931.14s)]
*  You get more people watching you of an evening than I do. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=934.54s)]
*  But all this doesn't answer the question of why we know you, me, all our friends are [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=937.1800000000001s)]

*  Now, it might have less to do without changes, our opinions and more to do with how it [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=950.74s)]
*  actually changes our experience of time. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=954.86s)]

*  Dude, let me have a moment to breathe. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=969.4200000000001s)]
*  OK, don't worry if you think I need to be hated on. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=972.02s)]
*  Trust me, anytime there's a new glazed piece, all of my insane haters get like MK Ultra [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=976.46s)]
*  style activated to be like, I'll have you know, he's actually a bad guy. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=981.66s)]
*  Please don't say he's a good guy. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=985.0600000000001s)]
*  He's a bad guy. I promise you he's a bad guy. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=986.1800000000001s)]
*  They go crazy over it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=988.38s)]
*  Trust. OK, I also get on by my long term subs anyway. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=989.58s)]
*  They lose their God. I wanted to give a shout out to our friends over at Yes, Please [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=993.4200000000001s)]
*  They're special because this is a company that I actually reached out to because I liked [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=997.78s)]
*  their coffee so much. I asked if they wanted to work with us. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1001.9s)]
*  And thank God they did. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1004.38s)]
*  They're based right here in Los Angeles. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1006.06s)]
*  They're independent company. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1007.86s)]
*  Their beans are awesome. I've been drinking Yes, Please for a few months now. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1009.14s)]
*  And it's some of the best coffee I've ever had. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1012.14s)]
*  My good friend, producer Olivia, said it changed her relationship to coffee. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1014.3s)]
*  A lot of people from our stream community have tried it and loved it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1017.62s)]
*  Go to their website and then use the code wisecrack for 20 percent off. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1020.34s)]
*  There is a link down in the description as well. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1024.82s)]
*  Truly top notch beans. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1027.82s)]
*  It's a great way to support the channel and help support a really cool independent [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1030.1799999999998s)]
*  company. So check out Yes, Please Coffee because, you know, I think you deserve it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1035.02s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. It's clear that authenticity is critical to the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1039.4199999999998s)]
*  success of political streaming. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1043.4199999999998s)]
*  But of course, it's not just about being cool and relatable. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1044.74s)]
*  Because some of these some of these guys aren't cool or relatable. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1048.86s)]
*  They're kind of weird and unrelatable. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1052.3400000000001s)]
*  It's at the very structure of the medium creates moments of truthfulness and both [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1054.94s)]
*  the streamer and their audience that are almost impossible to achieve. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1059.38s)]
*  This guy started talking to said you were obnoxious and a bad person. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1064.5800000000002s)]
*  But when I asked him to cite a reason for his opinion, he couldn't give one. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1067.02s)]
*  Yeah, because he saw like three Twitter power farmers. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1069.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're eating your ass up on Twitter right now. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1073.46s)]
*  Lama fail. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1075.7s)]
*  Dog, this is from September 15th, 2021, and it has two point nine K likes. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1077.42s)]
*  And it's literally a barb, dude. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1083.3400000000001s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1085.8600000000001s)]
*  What are we doing right now? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1087.7s)]
*  We're just like relitigating old drama that I was objectively correct on. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1088.78s)]
*  Your article is full of weirdos. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1093.78s)]
*  No, it's not. Not really familiar with the song. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1095.82s)]
*  He seems pretty cool, though. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1098.42s)]
*  We'll check him out in the future. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1099.5s)]
*  Why are you guys doing this? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1100.98s)]
*  We're watching literally we're watching. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1102.5800000000002s)]
*  We're straight up watching like a puff piece and you guys immediately [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1105.4199999999998s)]
*  like are sending me a million different a million different [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1110.3799999999999s)]
*  hater takes this crazy and other forms of digital media. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1114.9399999999998s)]
*  Now, we can better understand this via the work of French philosopher [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1119.6599999999999s)]
*  Henri Bergson and his concept of pure duration. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1123.02s)]
*  Now, for Bergson, duration is a way of thinking about time or a type of time [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1127.2199999999998s)]
*  which operates in distinction from clock time. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1133.62s)]
*  You know, it's not mathematical or mechanical. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1136.26s)]
*  Like I have a little watch right now. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1138.6999999999998s)]
*  And the second thing is going 50, 51, 52, 53, right? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1140.26s)]
*  Sequential, linear, mathematical things of that nature. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1144.6999999999998s)]
*  But duration is more to do with our experience of time. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1147.8999999999999s)]
*  Imagine what it feels like to wait for 45 minutes in the waiting room of your dentist. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1152.2199999999998s)]
*  Feels like an eternity. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1157.82s)]
*  Now imagine what it feels like to spend 45 minutes catching up with your best [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1159.06s)]
*  friend that you haven't seen in a while. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1162.86s)]
*  Probably flies by before you know it. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1164.1399999999999s)]
*  They're on their way and you wish that you could hang out for longer. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1166.02s)]
*  Same amount of linear time. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1168.86s)]
*  We experience it way differently. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1171.34s)]
*  And we see this at play in the unique temporal experience of watching a live stream. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1173.46s)]
*  Now, unlike watching a cable news show, which is broken up into distinct [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1177.78s)]
*  segments and commercial breaks equaling precisely one hour, you know, streams can [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1181.6599999999999s)]
*  often go on for hours without any segment breaks or time constraints. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1186.62s)]
*  Unless there's a three minute ad break at the top of the hour, of course, because at [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1190.58s)]
*  the top of the hour, there's a three minute ad break. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1193.82s)]
*  Some streamers do have sponsors take a little breaks to talk about that, but it's [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1195.5s)]
*  not quite the same as, you know, which of course, Lamau this video is going to make [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1200.9s)]
*  me stop watching streaming entirely. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1205.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1207.98s)]
*  Why, why are chat? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1208.18s)]
*  What is the reason for why chatters immediately try to grieve me when there's [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1209.3799999999999s)]
*  like, when there's any kind of like positive movement? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1213.82s)]
*  What is that about? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1217.22s)]
*  Like, and I know chatters aren't doing that because they like hate me or anything, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1218.5800000000002s)]
*  but it is a very weird attitude that a lot of chat has where they're like, it's [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1222.0600000000002s)]
*  weird, is a weird tendency that y'all have. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1226.38s)]
*  What is that? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1229.38s)]
*  They're like, damn man, people are saying nice things about you, dude. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1230.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, watch this guy lie about you. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1233.22s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1235.26s)]
*  Hey, look at this random tweet that like implies you like raping or something. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1236.42s)]
*  Like, okay, well, that person is schizophrenic. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1241.78s)]
*  What do you want me to do about it? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1245.14s)]
*  And yes, I have a lot of haters due to all of the positions that I advocate for, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1246.54s)]
*  which unfortunately are not all that common, even though it is born out of [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1250.78s)]
*  common sense and empathy, which again, seemingly less common by the moment. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1255.58s)]
*  So yeah, there's plenty of these people who are delusional and insane. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1260.4199999999998s)]
*  Don't know why you have to give them more air and, and I don't know, make it [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1264.4599999999998s)]
*  seem like it's a valid point of critique. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1271.1s)]
*  Cutting away to, I don't know, some commercial about mesothelioma. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1273.3s)]
*  How will this affect my loved ones? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1277.58s)]
*  But all of this creates a sense of flow that affects both the [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1279.7s)]
*  streamer and the audience. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1282.62s)]
*  And in doing so, it can collapse the way that we think about and experience time. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1283.74s)]
*  Now think about it this way. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1289.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1290.1s)]
*  You're pretty unlikely to get home from work and just say, now I'm going to sit [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1290.46s)]
*  in front of a screen for five hours, watching a guy talk about politics, play [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1294.1399999999999s)]
*  some games, Hey, maybe, maybe do some research instead. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1297.7s)]
*  You probably just tune into your favorite streamer. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1300.66s)]
*  And then before you know it, you're caught up in the discussion. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1302.8200000000002s)]
*  You're jumping in the chat. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1305.6200000000001s)]
*  You're participating in an active way and you know, then five hours have passed [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1306.66s)]
*  and, and holy crap, you have to be up for work soon. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1311.5800000000002s)]
*  Now for Bergson, this disillusion of clock time creates the space for pure [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1314.3000000000002s)]
*  duration, where we're purely in the moment, fully experiencing our own internal lives. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1318.8200000000002s)]
*  Now Bergson unfortunately died way before you could watch Hbomberguy [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1325.0600000000002s)]
*  stream Donkey Kong 64 for 57 hours straight, but you know, he'd maybe [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1329.54s)]
*  consider it in terms of music. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1334.74s)]
*  Chunky Kong is my favorite. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1336.62s)]
*  Now music does follow a specific temporal structure, right? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1338.4199999999998s)]
*  It conforms to a certain clock time. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1343.02s)]
*  Maybe a song is in four, four at 110 beats per minute. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1345.1s)]
*  But when you're caught up in a song that you love, your [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1348.62s)]
*  experience is one of pure duration. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1350.74s)]
*  You know, you're not thinking about measures and time signatures. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1353.1399999999999s)]
*  You're just fully in it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1356.3s)]
*  This is why deadheads can vibe out to a song for like 45 minutes and then [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1357.6999999999998s)]
*  want more as soon as it ends, you know, cause when that music never stops, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1361.6599999999999s)]
*  you sort of feel free from everything else. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1365.5s)]
*  This feeling of temporal freedom is the exception to the rule of our normal [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1368.78s)]
*  lives, which let's be honest, are mostly governed by clock time and more [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1372.3799999999999s)]
*  specifically work time or, or work clock time. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1376.4199999999998s)]
*  Now, as Bergson writes, we spend the majority of our lives outside ourselves, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1380.5s)]
*  hardly perceiving anything of ourselves, but our own ghost. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1384.78s)]
*  He goes on to write that we live for the external world rather than for ourselves. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1388.1000000000001s)]
*  We speak rather than we think we are acted rather than act ourselves. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1392.7s)]
*  This means that our identities and our internal states of consciousness [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1398.14s)]
*  are shaped by rigid clock time. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1401.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like maybe I'm this person when I'm at home. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1403.5400000000002s)]
*  Yep. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1406.78s)]
*  When I'm this person. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1407.5s)]
*  He does not extend so far as to her putting a man's life at stake. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1408.6200000000001s)]
*  And I'm this person with my old timey street gang. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1414.34s)]
*  Everybody dress up sweet and sharp. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1417.26s)]
*  We can sing vicious four part harmonies and then just cut you into pieces. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1419.34s)]
*  But consider from a perspective of duration, I'm all of these things at once. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1423.78s)]
*  And my identity and consciousness are constantly unfolding and streamers [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1428.54s)]
*  are able to tap into this, you know, creating an experience of duration in [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1432.9s)]
*  which different elements of their consciousness or perspective emerge over [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1436.18s)]
*  time. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1440.1s)]
*  You think about the stream marathons of someone like Ludwig where dramatic [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1440.62s)]
*  variations in his behavior can create a palpable sense of authenticity. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1444.86s)]
*  You know, sometimes even a streamers mistakes or lapses in judgment or random [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1448.82s)]
*  asides, you know, make them feel most real to us. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1453.3s)]
*  Hawk to on that fovea. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1456.3s)]
*  You know, take this time that Assam piker seemingly forgetting that he was [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1458.1399999999999s)]
*  streaming, got a little bit distracted. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1461.3s)]
*  That was my inside voice that came out. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1463.46s)]
*  I was just off myself. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1465.34s)]
*  But the sort of realness that emerges via duration doesn't just lead to [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1466.6999999999998s)]
*  personal details or accidental bro behavior. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1470.26s)]
*  It also creates a particular experience for us, the audience, one in which I am [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1473.14s)]
*  actively listening and engaging and experiencing myself thinking in real time. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1477.98s)]
*  You know, when this is happening, it can feel like my identity is unfolding in [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1482.82s)]
*  dialogue with both the streamer I'm watching and the community that I'm [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1486.86s)]
*  engaging with. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1490.74s)]
*  This can all create the conditions for the political streamer to truly guide the [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1491.54s)]
*  audience when dealing with tricky or contentious issues and policies. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1495.74s)]
*  And when they do this, they might help the audience see past rhetorical traps [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1499.34s)]
*  and empty platitudes, ideally creating the feeling that you're learning alongside [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1502.82s)]
*  your favorite streamer and the authenticity of the medium mixed with the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1506.82s)]
*  freedom of duration can then lower our guards. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1509.98s)]
*  And that makes us maybe more likely to reconsider our opinions or remain open to [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1512.78s)]
*  ideas we don't immediately agree with. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1517.1s)]
*  That might sound like I'm being too gracious, but I've seen this a little bit [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1519.94s)]
*  on our tiny little YouTube streams where people in the chat kind of open their [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1524.3s)]
*  minds, debate with each other, change their minds on stuff. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1529.34s)]
*  It's a very beautiful thing to see. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1532.34s)]
*  Other time. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1533.78s)]
*  Look, I, yep, he has a psychiatry degree. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1534.86s)]
*  None of what he's saying holds on fact. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1537.54s)]
*  YouTube guy thinks he's a psychiatrist now. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1539.62s)]
*  Um, the only thing I will say is that there is obviously a lot of, of back and [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1542.78s)]
*  forth in the community building and it can be used for good or it can be used for [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1547.3s)]
*  evil. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1552.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1553.2199999999998s)]
*  If you are using the, if you are using a, the community that you've cultivated over [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1554.1s)]
*  the course of many, many years to like harm others, to go after others that you [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1560.6999999999998s)]
*  feel have wronged you and slowly but surely cutting out like anyone that is a [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1565.26s)]
*  naysayer, then you are operating of cult in the most toxic ways possible. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1569.9799999999998s)]
*  If you're using that to defend, you're just an objectively bad person. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1575.1399999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1579.62s)]
*  This is precisely the reason why I try to put my best foot forward all the time. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1580.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1586.78s)]
*  Like I, I know the amount of, I don't want to say power, but the, the amount of, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1587.8999999999999s)]
*  of influence I have, and I try to use that for good. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1593.34s)]
*  I try to use that to motivate you to go out and work out, motivate you to go out [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1597.8999999999999s)]
*  and better yourselves, motivate you to go out and, and do things and become a [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1603.3799999999999s)]
*  positive influence in your community. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1608.82s)]
*  Like I recognize, I recognize the influence that I hold and the place I have [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1611.4199999999998s)]
*  in your lives. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1615.62s)]
*  And I try to use that to, to max out on all the good that I want you to do. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1616.1s)]
*  Sometimes they just say, this channel fell off. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1622.58s)]
*  Why is he here? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1625.3s)]
*  Now we can see some of this in Piker's analysis of a debate between Ben Shapiro [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1626.4199999999998s)]
*  and Malcolm Nance in which, you know, the audience gets all the benefits of having [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1630.58s)]
*  a political commentator who can translate, add context and fact check in real time. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1634.02s)]
*  This enhances the audience's understanding and equips them to [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1638.74s)]
*  critically engage for themselves. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1641.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1642.94s)]
*  It's actually pretty simple. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1644.0600000000002s)]
*  And it's not just the political streamers are able to offer us more honest and [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1645.5400000000002s)]
*  authentic analysis than traditional news media. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1649.3400000000001s)]
*  They also have a pretty dialectical relationship with their audiences, you [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1651.74s)]
*  know, participating in an open back and forth that can shift the conversation [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1655.42s)]
*  or lead to digressions and insights that a streamer maybe wouldn't [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1660.38s)]
*  arrive at on their own. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1663.78s)]
*  The duration of these streams in the communities they engender really do [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1665.0600000000002s)]
*  open up new types of interaction between hosts and audience. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1668.5s)]
*  One where unlike most experiences of our media consumption, you feel like [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1671.34s)]
*  be relational aggression as a result of you creating a tightly bonded community [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1676.18s)]
*  can cause a lot of chatters to feel as though their parasocial bond is [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1679.66s)]
*  threatened when your image of being a hated for saying the truth is threatened [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1682.02s)]
*  by showing you, you may not have as many haters. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1685.42s)]
*  It causes sort of dissonance where your chatters support you, but feel your [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1688.22s)]
*  changing image can threaten who you are. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1691.1s)]
*  TLDR, they're toxic. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1692.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1694.7s)]
*  I mean, I think it's in the simplest, not nerdy words, just gatekeeping. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1694.9s)]
*  A lot of people forget that like I have an overarching ideological goal with my [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1699.5400000000002s)]
*  commentary, with my Twitch stream. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1704.74s)]
*  And that goal is to get broad acceptance for the ideas that I hold, the ideas [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1707.46s)]
*  that many of you also now believe as well, or maybe believed even long before me. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1712.94s)]
*  And that is precisely the reason why I always want to expand. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1717.9s)]
*  I always want to grow this community. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1721.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1723.98s)]
*  Every single thing that I do is in the direction of growing this community so [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1724.58s)]
*  that there are more like-minded people that will be more charitable to my worldview. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1728.98s)]
*  Because I think that my worldview would genuinely improve people's material [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1734.38s)]
*  conditions. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1739.26s)]
*  So a lot of people fail to remember that and sometimes maybe think, Oh, I [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1739.8600000000001s)]
*  want to gatekeep this stuff. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1744.3400000000001s)]
*  I just, I don't like it. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1745.58s)]
*  Like you're getting, you're getting looks by NBC. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1747.02s)]
*  You got prominently displayed on CNN. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1749.78s)]
*  That's not a good thing. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1752.6200000000001s)]
*  That's a bad thing. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1753.7s)]
*  It's only a bad thing. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1755.18s)]
*  It's only, wait, what? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1756.54s)]
*  So your voice does matter, but you won't endorse Kamala. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1758.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1760.6200000000001s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1760.94s)]
*  If Kamala wants my endorsement, she can have it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1761.78s)]
*  She just needs to say the magic words. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1763.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1766.3s)]
*  No more weapons to Israel. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1767.06s)]
*  Also none of this right wing immigration stuff, but you know, those are, those are [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1768.94s)]
*  things you, aside from the Kamala quip here, I think a lot of people don't [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1774.06s)]
*  understand, I think a lot of people don't understand that like there is a, there is [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1778.1000000000001s)]
*  a goal beyond just like me. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1782.7s)]
*  That's why I do these collaborations too. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1786.8600000000001s)]
*  And also because I like to have fun and be normal in the wild as well. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1788.9s)]
*  It's like when my dog sees other dogs come up to me and she gets super jelly. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1792.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1795.8600000000001s)]
*  Being in the audience actually matters. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1796.5s)]
*  You know, we see this in an instance like Piker responding to his audience when [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1798.9s)]
*  they had concerns about the rise of anti woke rhetoric. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1802.9s)]
*  It's no longer going to be irrelevant when that's all you talk about in the next four [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1805.78s)]
*  years. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1810.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm just telling you what's going to happen. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1810.98s)]
*  Dude, that was such a good lock, man. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1813.6200000000001s)]
*  That guy is damn. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1815.9s)]
*  What was the date on that? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1817.54s)]
*  When he said that like, we're going back to Gamergate style politics. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1818.8200000000002s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1822.54s)]
*  Seems like I locked that down on December 22nd, 2020. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1823.66s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1827.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1828.7s)]
*  Pre-watch of the future. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1829.3s)]
*  Once again, pre-watch Piker at it again, dude, at it again, dude. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1830.38s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1834.5800000000002s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1835.6200000000001s)]
*  How did he do? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1836.3400000000001s)]
*  How does he do it? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1837.3s)]
*  How did he do it? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1838.38s)]
*  How did he figure that out, dude? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1839.6200000000001s)]
*  God damn. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1841.14s)]
*  God damn, dude. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1842.6200000000001s)]
*  I clocked that from a mile away in the next four years. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1844.3s)]
*  I'm just telling you what's going to happen. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1848.18s)]
*  The unique temporal nature of political streaming might then be one of the reasons [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1850.22s)]
*  that it creates such impassioned communities, which is all well and good. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1854.14s)]
*  But if you're like me, you might still be a little skeptical of the actual political [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1859.54s)]
*  efficacy of any of this, you know, because sure, political streamers draw audiences as [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1863.46s)]
*  large as traditional news outlets, but are they as politically influential? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1868.1s)]
*  Now, this question feels especially relevant when we know that networks like Fox News [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1873.26s)]
*  and CNN or podcasts like Pod Save America have exhibited the power to influence voters. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1877.62s)]
*  Here, the thing that makes streaming so interesting on a theoretical level, you know, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1883.06s)]
*  that the temporality that comes through an experience of duration might actually be [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1886.86s)]
*  the problem. By keeping folks locked into a consumptive trance, it's arguably doing [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1891.58s)]
*  the opposite of facilitating offline political activism, which raises the question, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1896.46s)]
*  you know, are we too busy watching political streams to actually participate in [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1900.54s)]
*  politics? Well, maybe not, because recently we have seen more and more streamers step [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1905.58s)]
*  out of their bedrooms and engage in on the ground reporting that connects their [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1910.9s)]
*  streaming work to political action, while also offering more immediate and authentic [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1914.94s)]
*  coverage than what we might find on the evening news. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1918.94s)]
*  And, you know, all of this is, of course, made easier by the relative accessibility [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1922.06s)]
*  and affordability streaming technology. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1925.9s)]
*  And we see this whether it's Hassan Piker visiting a campus protest at UCLA or [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1928.18s)]
*  Destiny visiting Israel. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1933.7s)]
*  These on the ground reactions. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1936.0600000000002s)]
*  You know, whether it be the anti-guy going to an anti-protest or the pro-guy going to [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1937.8200000000002s)]
*  the country. Yeah, checking my notes, seems like this guy is pro at the country, doing [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1944.5800000000002s)]
*  more pro-propaganda. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1951.8200000000002s)]
*  Current political events, you know, highlighted, especially in the coverage, ongoing [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1953.58s)]
*  campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza are especially impactful during a time [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1957.14s)]
*  when it really does feel like there's a growing information vacuum, whether it's, you [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1963.26s)]
*  know, the defunding of newsrooms. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1967.26s)]
*  But also, that's the other thing is like, what what market void are you filling? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1969.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like, hey, guys, there wasn't enough. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1973.74s)]
*  There wasn't enough mainstream outlets that were unconditionally defending Israel [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1977.18s)]
*  from Israel. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1981.9399999999998s)]
*  So we got another guy to go and defend Israel from Israel, who was also pro-Israel. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1983.78s)]
*  You know, there was a there was a real shortage in mainstream media for people who would [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1991.4199999999998s)]
*  do the brave task of defending Israel. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=1996.74s)]
*  But this time, they also say slurs. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2000.26s)]
*  OK, real, real market void for Jake Tapper not defending the right to say the N word [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2003.06s)]
*  as a white guy. So now we got Jake Tapper, but he also defends saying the N word as a [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2010.22s)]
*  white guy. Oh, my Lord. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2015.74s)]
*  Real untapped market for a liberal who is basically a 4chan vacuum across America or [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2018.5s)]
*  the seeming. Europe said he's in the same bit as you. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2029.82s)]
*  I mean, yeah, for sure. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2032.8600000000001s)]
*  I think that what I do is good and I think what he does is objectively a stain on mankind. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2035.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't know why this is like an own in your mind. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2041.94s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2045.5800000000002s)]
*  I think like a guy who is a serial mass harasser of anyone who he sicks his rabid fan base [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2046.9s)]
*  on is not a good guy, especially when he's defending a scourge, if you will. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2054.2200000000003s)]
*  Tame ability of fake news. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2060.1s)]
*  It's all led to an overall decline in the quality of and our trust versus, as Palmer, Taff, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2062.3s)]
*  and Nielsen argue, when the public view the media as less trustworthy than politicians, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2068.1800000000003s)]
*  it becomes easier for populist figures to lump the news media into a group with political [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2072.86s)]
*  and economic elites and claim for themselves the role of public defender. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2077.78s)]
*  And for younger folks who have come of age in this era of distrust, streaming seems like [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2081.7000000000003s)]
*  a viable alternative for a number of reasons, especially as it continues to enter the real [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2085.78s)]
*  Now, one of them is that it's unfiltered and instantaneous nature allows viewers to [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2091.14s)]
*  witness events as they unfold in real time, which facilitates trust while also minimizing [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2095.8599999999997s)]
*  the potential manipulation we might associate with edited news broadcasts. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2101.06s)]
*  Another is that when streamers are reporting from the field, they're normally going to center [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2105.22s)]
*  the perspectives of regular people actively participating in the event rather than highly [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2109.3799999999997s)]
*  paid experts or pundits typically featured on mainstream news shows. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2115.3799999999997s)]
*  You know, someone who was personally watching both streams from the UCLA protest earlier [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2119.14s)]
*  this year, and then also watching local LA news, I'll simply say that we saw two pretty [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2123.86s)]
*  different perspectives on what was happening. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2129.7799999999997s)]
*  I think this alongside with like what Brett did, like all the other content creators that [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2132.82s)]
*  were there, like I think this was our like this was, I think, one of my most consequential [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2138.1s)]
*  things that I've done. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2145.14s)]
*  You're blinded by your hate of the gnome and are not being truthful. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2146.42s)]
*  Both of you are misrepresenting each other. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2149.2200000000003s)]
*  Maybe this is by design and I'm a naive viewer. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2151.38s)]
*  Yes, you're a 24 month subscriber that is a naive viewer. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2154.26s)]
*  I'm always in awe of how people can maintain this like both sides are the same principle. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2158.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2164.1000000000004s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2165.2200000000003s)]
*  I am not misrepresenting Destiny's pro-Israel proposition. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2166.34s)]
*  He has personally said it himself. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2171.1400000000003s)]
*  You're talking about a dude who has openly actively mentioned like masturbating to my [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2173.3s)]
*  podcast co-hosts AI porn as an own, okay, who has very publicly put his name out there [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2179.2200000000003s)]
*  to be like, yeah, I will do that. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2187.3s)]
*  And his community that still also repeats those words. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2189.3s)]
*  I don't think there's any both sides. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2193.1400000000003s)]
*  There is nothing that you can there's nothing that you can equate in this circumstance [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2194.6600000000003s)]
*  that I've done. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2198.42s)]
*  I care about the issues. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2200.02s)]
*  I care about, you know, policies. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2202.1s)]
*  I care about offering context to real-time news coverage. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2205.22s)]
*  He cares about drama. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2210.1s)]
*  Anyway, why was this your most consequential stream? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2211.7799999999997s)]
*  Because I think there is no better demonstration of mainstream media openly and actively framing [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2214.42s)]
*  an issue in a nefarious way than then basically fucking pointing to what the actual encampments [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2220.3399999999997s)]
*  look like from the inside versus how the media covered it. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2227.94s)]
*  Like it was such a glaringly obvious piece of original reporting that went against what [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2231.38s)]
*  the media's overarching narrative was about these encampments being like aggressive in [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2238.9s)]
*  nature. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2243.94s)]
*  I'm still waiting to see what this person is saying. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2246.1s)]
*  Both of like, this is the most active defense that you can engage with without coming across [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2248.7400000000002s)]
*  as like a pure partisan in this situation. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2254.26s)]
*  Oh, well, both of you guys do stuff. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2256.18s)]
*  And it's always funny when they say that because there was a discord. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2258.4199999999996s)]
*  There was literally like discord screenshots of them mentioning me like what 90,000 times [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2262.74s)]
*  versus my discord. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2268.58s)]
*  We looked at it and the name destiny was mentioned 9,000 total times and the overwhelming [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2269.7s)]
*  majority of that was coming from the gaming discussion part of my discord because they [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2276.18s)]
*  were talking about the video game. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2280.66s)]
*  So it's almost always like 90 to 10, but people still maintain this position as though [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2282.5s)]
*  there's like both sides are doing this for the past like what six years at this point. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2289.2200000000003s)]
*  I've rarely ever mentioned this person. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2295.38s)]
*  He has never stopped mentioning me. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2297.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2299.62s)]
*  Oh, here. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2300.1s)]
*  This is the one. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2300.66s)]
*  This was the link. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2301.46s)]
*  It was crazy saying that it is better than a terrorist, which is better than a registered [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2302.58s)]
*  sex offender, which is better than a Hassan piker fan. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2306.34s)]
*  You know, just normal, not unhinged statements. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2309.3s)]
*  The only time he mentioned he didn't want you talking about him was when he was getting [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2311.78s)]
*  destroyed by Finkelstein. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2314.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that was a wonderful moment online. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2315.78s)]
*  Why can't we chat his name though? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2318.5800000000004s)]
*  I know you don't care about him enough to ban his name and chat for obvious reasons [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2319.6200000000003s)]
*  because I don't want him to, I don't want him to, to like, I don't want mentions of [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2323.7000000000003s)]
*  bone or celly to be gumming up the works. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2328.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2331.86s)]
*  Like right now, this is a great example. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2332.5s)]
*  We've taken a sidestep from this. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2334.6600000000003s)]
*  We've we stopped the coverage of whatever the, we were looking at. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2337.6200000000003s)]
*  And now his insane fan base is just going crazy over it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2340.66s)]
*  But what did that guy say? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2345.14s)]
*  I'm pro Palestine all the way actually went away from your stream in 2021. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2346.5s)]
*  Since you were not bringing up Palestine, you're the best on Palestine. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2349.7s)]
*  And that's what matters the most to me. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2352.2599999999998s)]
*  But both of you are bad faith. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2353.94s)]
*  Maybe there's way too much bad blood between the two of you. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2355.22s)]
*  Dude, why is it that whenever I ask for a direct question, these guys never actually, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2357.94s)]
*  these guys never actually bring anything up, you know, it just doesn't make any sense. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2362.66s)]
*  It just doesn't. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2367.22s)]
*  I always ask, I'm like, what do you mean by this? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2368.1s)]
*  Like, what have I done that is like bad faith? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2370.18s)]
*  And there's no, like, there's no good answer. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2372.3399999999997s)]
*  It's always just like some weird, vague generalization. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2374.5s)]
*  Pro-Palestinian activists in this barricaded encampment refuse. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2378.02s)]
*  Can you guys talk one time? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2381.14s)]
*  You guys are top political live streamers. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2382.3399999999997s)]
*  First of all, come on. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2383.7s)]
*  It's like Albania saying between us and the United States, you know, we are what comprise [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2384.8999999999996s)]
*  of NATO, you know, just like back in the day when Albania was saying between us and China, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2390.4199999999996s)]
*  we comprise of a billion. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2396.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2398.2599999999998s)]
*  You're being a little nice. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2399.14s)]
*  I think is this group cyber stalking? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2400.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2402.34s)]
*  You know what you've done. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2402.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2404.58s)]
*  I'm as pro-Palestine as it gets, which is why you were just as bad as the pro sponsored [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2405.14s)]
*  by Israel and word use defending white guy. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2408.98s)]
*  Hey man, why don't you talk to the guy who's like objectively pro? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2411.38s)]
*  He was actively cyber stalked you with his community for the past six years, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2414.18s)]
*  who has taken every opportunity to lie about you to as many people that will listen. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2418.1s)]
*  Why don't you just like be charitable to that guy who you disagree with on virtually [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2423.22s)]
*  every issue. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2428.26s)]
*  Just talk to him after he got banned for literally mass harassment over and over again [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2428.7400000000002s)]
*  for any person, including myself, but I'm at least like large enough to withstand these kinds [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2435.0600000000004s)]
*  of attacks, but like any creator, my size all the way down to like tiny creators, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2440.1000000000004s)]
*  like 30 concurrent viewers. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2445.94s)]
*  Good faith, bro. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2448.98s)]
*  That's the difference. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2450.1000000000004s)]
*  I want nothing to do with this person. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2450.6600000000003s)]
*  Did you just leak why he got banned? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2452.1800000000003s)]
*  No, there are a million reasons. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2454.26s)]
*  This is my suspicion. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2456.74s)]
*  Why don't you just blog them? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2458.4199999999996s)]
*  I have. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2459.4599999999996s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2460.18s)]
*  I have. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2461.4599999999996s)]
*  There is not a moment in my day where I think about this person or his community. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2462.2599999999998s)]
*  It's only when I'm live, when his fans come in here with like their 11th sock account [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2467.14s)]
*  or sometimes dual fans, which is even weirder that have been around for a very long time [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2472.18s)]
*  where they come in and they're like, well, you know, both of you guys have done stuff. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2476.3399999999997s)]
*  I have my reasons. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2481.14s)]
*  I have. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2482.5s)]
*  You can them Twitch for unbanning sneako and not unbanning boner. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2483.3799999999997s)]
*  Chilly. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2486.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2487.8599999999997s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous that Twitch unban sneaker. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2488.1s)]
*  I think both sneaker and boner. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2491.3799999999997s)]
*  Chilly should continue being banned. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2494.1s)]
*  If it were up to me, I would never unban sneaker. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2496.4199999999996s)]
*  Are you insane? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2498.66s)]
*  Are you out of your mind? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2499.7799999999997s)]
*  Do you think I do the guys have like, you think I have a positive association [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2500.98s)]
*  with like Twitch turning around and unbanning some random freaks, dude? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2506.98s)]
*  Are you crazy? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2511.9399999999996s)]
*  I'd much rather unban. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2512.82s)]
*  I show speed before unbanning someone like sneaker. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2514.1800000000003s)]
*  And for the record, I am pro rehabilitation. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2517.38s)]
*  It's just someone needs to be rehabilitated first. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2520.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2525.1400000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2526.02s)]
*  Using an order to disperse. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2527.7000000000003s)]
*  And the efficacy seems has definitely caught the attention of politicians want to spend. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2532.82s)]
*  Mods got to him before me. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2537.54s)]
*  The antenatal is weirdo. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2540.42s)]
*  Speak directly to younger voters. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2542.26s)]
*  Now at the end of the 2020 election season, congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2544.0200000000004s)]
*  Ilan Omar jumped on Twitch to organize a get out the vote stream with a variety of [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2548.82s)]
*  popular streamers, politically minded and otherwise. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2553.6200000000003s)]
*  They played the then popular multiplayer game Among Us and they had over half a million people, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2556.26s)]
*  most of whom were of early voting age, who were there to watch and ask questions about [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2561.94s)]
*  the candidates and policies in a way that felt a lot more authentic and casual than [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2566.1000000000004s)]
*  a press conference or even a real town hall. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2571.22s)]
*  Imagine showing up to the doctor and just saying you need help and getting it. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2574.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, more recently at the 2024 DNC, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2581.7s)]
*  Hassan Piker was on location streaming until he maybe got kicked out. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2584.3399999999997s)]
*  And of course, politicians on the right have also been attempting to use streaming [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2588.58s)]
*  as a way to get out their messages, as in Trump's aforementioned appearance on Aiden Ross's stream, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2592.2599999999998s)]
*  in which Ross, I guess, gifted Trump a Rolex and a Cybertruck. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2597.46s)]
*  I can't imagine Donald Trump driving a car. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2601.46s)]
*  Can he drive a car? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2604.26s)]
*  Is there a video of him driving? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2605.7s)]
*  I've seen him on a golf cart, not a car. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2606.82s)]
*  If you have video of him driving a car, send it to us. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2608.18s)]
*  I don't think he can drive a car. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2610.02s)]
*  And in 2022, GOP rep Matt Gaetz live streamed on Twitch. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2611.3s)]
*  And hey, if you didn't see it, it did not go super well. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2615.78s)]
*  You know, while my streaming numbers are not amazing, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2620.1s)]
*  I consistently dominate Matt Gaetz, which is something. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2623.06s)]
*  So if the revolution won't be televised, will it at least be streamed? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2626.18s)]
*  Friends, it's hard to say, but it is worth noting that it's not all good vibes [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2630.02s)]
*  and egalitarian spirit in the world of political streaming. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2634.2599999999998s)]
*  There's a bunch of stuff we didn't include in this video, to be very honest with you, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2637.22s)]
*  because a lot of the right wing streaming folks that are popular very much are little Nazis. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2640.66s)]
*  And we didn't want to put little Nazis in the video. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2646.74s)]
*  Now, plenty of folks who are out there use their platforms to just reinforce the status quo, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2648.3399999999997s)]
*  while cultivating audiences that are more sycophantic than curious. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2653.54s)]
*  But on a personal level, during my experience streaming here on YouTube, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2657.3s)]
*  I've really gotten to see how quickly communities of open-minded [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2662.2599999999998s)]
*  and empathetic and weird people can form. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2665.3s)]
*  And then how these communities can be used to facilitate spaces of critical thinking [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2668.18s)]
*  about what's going on in the world. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2672.34s)]
*  Special shout out to all the Wisecrack Liveheads out there. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2674.34s)]
*  I really like you all very much. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2677.22s)]
*  Thanks for hanging out with me every week. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2679.22s)]
*  I also do want to give a shout out to Garrett Cooper. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2680.82s)]
*  Now, he helped us with this video and he recently finished a whole PhD project [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2684.34s)]
*  on political streaming. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2687.78s)]
*  He shared some of that research with us. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2688.98s)]
*  He helped out with this. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2690.5800000000004s)]
*  And if you want to learn more about Garrett and his work, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2691.7000000000003s)]
*  tune in to our stream on Wednesday and we're going to have him on [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2694.5s)]
*  to talk about his project and more about streaming. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2698.42s)]
*  And in general, if you've ever wanted to check out one of our streams, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2701.1400000000003s)]
*  we stream every Monday and every Wednesday at 10 a.m. Pacific, right here. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2703.86s)]
*  Desperate for any crumb of interaction. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2711.38s)]
*  Please stop. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2714.6600000000003s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2716.5s)]
*  On YouTube, I would love to see you there. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2717.94s)]
*  In the meantime, let us know what you think and especially let us know [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2720.02s)]
*  if there's political streamers that you like a lot, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2722.9s)]
*  especially if they're maybe less well known, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2724.9s)]
*  it would be great to give those people some shine. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2727.3s)]
*  But most important, coming out of the gutter, dude, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2729.78s)]
*  the moment that like even this is like briefly mentioned, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2732.1000000000004s)]
*  his weirdo fan base and like adjacent orbiters immediately, immediately. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2736.5s)]
*  They're like, it's just like that one guy that came up to me at TwitchCon, bro. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2744.18s)]
*  He's like, come on, why don't you debate Destiny? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2748.18s)]
*  It's like, bro, what, what, why do you even remotely [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2751.14s)]
*  think this would be productive in any capacity? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2755.22s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2757.86s)]
*  I thought by this point, we might have banned every single person [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2759.3s)]
*  and I'm constantly in awe that there are still always new sock accounts. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2763.7s)]
*  Like it is wild, especially because, especially because like, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2769.9399999999996s)]
*  I don't think there's another community that is this resilient [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2775.62s)]
*  with the limited amount of size that they have. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2779.22s)]
*  But like the amount of impact that they have that is so outsized [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2782.66s)]
*  because they're just constantly, permanently online, holy. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2786.3399999999997s)]
*  One of your security guards loved that you'd done that kid, by the way. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2794.1s)]
*  It's just like dedicate your life to anything else, please, man. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2811.62s)]
*  Please, I promise you. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2816.8999999999996s)]
*  I promise you, you will be much happier. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2819.3799999999997s)]
*  I promise. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2821.86s)]
*  And it's like my idiotic community members too. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2822.7400000000002s)]
*  Can you comment on this asshole saying you're endorsing raping women is actually so gross? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2825.86s)]
*  No, dude, because that is an insane thing. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2830.1000000000004s)]
*  And you bringing that up literally is just giving it legitimacy. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2833.38s)]
*  How do you not understand that? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2837.2200000000003s)]
*  Why would I ever in a million years respond to something so obviously out of context? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2839.6200000000003s)]
*  Are you actually brain dead? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2847.6200000000003s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2849.3s)]
*  Sometimes I can't tell if this is a person who thinks they're doing the right thing. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2851.7s)]
*  That tweet at 6k likes before Hasan put it on screen, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2856.2599999999998s)]
*  now it has 19k likes, you're all drama addicted idiots. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2858.42s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2860.8199999999997s)]
*  I genuinely want to get it. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2862.18s)]
*  I genuinely want to dive into the minds of people like this that are just like, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2863.62s)]
*  no, dude, I don't understand. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2866.98s)]
*  The reason why I have so many active haters is because I already gave them a crumb [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2868.98s)]
*  by consistently, repeatedly trying to answer misinformation about me. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2874.42s)]
*  People would make up and I'd be like, oh, wait, hold on. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2881.8599999999997s)]
*  That's completely made up. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2884.9s)]
*  Let me actually explain the truth to you. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2886.2599999999998s)]
*  And over the course of like five, six years, I came to the conclusion [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2889.06s)]
*  that, oh, nobody actually gives a shit about the truth. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2893.62s)]
*  When I turn around and address it, it just gives it more breathing room. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2897.3799999999997s)]
*  It gives it more legitimacy. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2901.22s)]
*  And it is a signal for all the people that are waiting in the sidelines to be like, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2902.9s)]
*  yeah, this guy, that's it. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2907.14s)]
*  It's all bad faith here. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2908.9s)]
*  Say for the sake of argument, you're the kind of progressive lefty with a platform [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2910.74s)]
*  who gets a share of harassment, seasonal or... [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2l1ai-hcI&t=2915.22s)]
