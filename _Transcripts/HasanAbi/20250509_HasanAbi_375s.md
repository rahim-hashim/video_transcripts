# Why Ethan Klein’s Take On Israel Is So Dangerous | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU)
*  bro. Ethan loves talking about tokens. He won't even let his Lebanese employees say [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=0.0s)]
*  shit, which is why he has to bring in another Lebanese Scottish guy because he knows that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=7.96s)]
*  AB does not agree with Ethan on this stuff. So we has to get a Lebanese Dick rider. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=15.02s)]
*  The H3 subreddit is now targeting Bizon out of the Emmy award winning Palestinian journals. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=27.62s)]
*  It was currently enduring at the hands of Israel. She's a kin. It's actually can and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=31.380000000000003s)]
*  Frank in the latest episode, Olivia mentioned Bizon out of Gaza, Gaza and Jordan. What the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=34.3s)]
*  wrong me. I'm sorry, but there are a few other things to know about bizarre, not to discredit [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=39.02s)]
*  everything she's been posting. She sometimes spreads some mass propaganda, antisemitic conspiracy [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=42.900000000000006s)]
*  theories, and even vaccine misinformation. She's affiliated with this organization, PFLP, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=47.66s)]
*  and she might've taken a crowdfunding money meant for Gaza's all to herself. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=51.5s)]
*  Hey, I think if you're writing stuff like this, charty Ella or whatever the your name [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=56.54s)]
*  is, you should also get in the contraption. I won't be able to tell you exactly what I [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=61.94s)]
*  think should be done with you because like I said, it would probably be a violation of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=66.38s)]
*  terms of service, but you can probably imagine what kind of medieval style penalties you [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=70.08s)]
*  should incur for thinking such thoughts for writing such thoughts out loud for being such [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  a gross, monstrous piece of shit. Thank you for being a part of the pro-Palestinian community [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=81.56s)]
*  while also simultaneously saying pro-Palestinian things like, Oh, well, this journalist I'll [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=85.72s)]
*  have, you know, is actually an anti-vaxxer antisemite. Cool. Yeah. I think that that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=90.2s)]
*  community is unsalvageable and they're little monsters. They're monstrous little freaks. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=96.76s)]
*  And I think they should all stop being that way for the sake of humanity. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=102.0s)]
*  Ethan Clash at a post criticizing us on the home by honest reporting, honest reporting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=109.6s)]
*  Oh my God. They went with honest reporting is Israeli media advocacy group, a pro-Israel [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=114.6s)]
*  media watchdog. It describes his mission is combating ideological prejudice in journalism [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=119.52s)]
*  and the media as it impacts Israel. Dude, I love being pro-Palestinian and then posting [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  honest reporting. What's next? Camera. What are we doing? Memory camera. Look at the second [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=127.75999999999999s)]

*  like, yo, as Muslims, we deserve very little as Muslim. We deserve actually, but it's fake. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  It's not, dude. I love that. I love that for the pro-Palestinian community. A letter from [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgBWRc4JIU&t=166.04s)]
