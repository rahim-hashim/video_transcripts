# Why Did The Middle Classes Support Fascism? | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk)
*  The American modern right wing movement also is very good at universalizing their outwardly awful [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=0.0s)]
*  policies. They never say we are here to defend big businesses. They say small businesses are the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  backbone of the American economy. We're here to support small businesses when in fact, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=14.4s)]
*  their policy agenda is greatly beneficial for big businesses. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=20.56s)]
*  Let's watch the second thought video on liberal collaborations with uh this episode is brought to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=30.56s)]
*  you by audible start the timer i've got like 20 minutes tops to cover socialism communism [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=37.2s)]
*  corporatism ism actually no this is too broad i want to i want to dial in specifically on here [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=43.36s)]
*  let's look at the united states comparisons on on how this in the united states the middle class [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=49.84s)]
*  has played a central role since its very inception america is often referred to as a nation of small [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=55.6s)]
*  businesses and small business is a big part of american ideology often standing in as a symbol [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=62.08s)]
*  of individual freedom and independence thomas jefferson's ideal citizen was the self-sufficient [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  and independent land-owning farmer an ideal that retained its appeal even as it soon became obsolete [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=74.4s)]
*  in the face of expanding markets and during the cold war small business owners and their ideals [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=80.64s)]
*  in both urban and rural areas were used as a bulwark against the spread of communism to this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=85.52s)]
*  day small businesses play a very significant role in america's self-understanding and are generally [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=90.16s)]
*  viewed very positively one day i want to own my own business be my own boss probably nothing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  embodies the essence of the american dream more than that thought there's a lot of idealization [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=101.36s)]
*  and romanticism surrounding small business both on the right and the left small businesses are seen [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=105.84s)]
*  as personal relatable and admirable and a 2017 poll 70 percent of americans said they have a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=110.88s)]
*  great deal or a lot of confidence in small businesses and i get it in our world small [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=116.8s)]
*  businesses bring a lot of local color to many places and allow for products and experiences [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  that you couldn't get anywhere else but we shouldn't let such romanticism blind us to the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=126.08s)]
*  many problems that small businesses often come with because they are still businesses in the end [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=130.0s)]
*  and that means profit is their primary motive in the united states small businesses on average [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=135.12s)]
*  pay lower wages provide worse benefits are exempt from crucial labor protections and due to their [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=139.6s)]
*  small size tend to make unionization difficult which tends to leave small business employees [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  with little to no bargaining power in the u.s federal law requires businesses to provide medical [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=149.12s)]
*  coverage after discharge only if they have 20 or more employees and family and medical leave only [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  if they have 50 or more employees thus exempting many small businesses and anti-discrimination laws [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=159.04s)]
*  whether against race or gender only apply if you employ 15 or more people all of which often [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=164.72s)]
*  allow small business owners to be tyrants towards those they employ and they will sometimes use [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=169.6s)]
*  their status as small business owners to justify overworking and underpaying people whether small [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=174.0s)]
*  or big businesses compete in the same market in which success requires ruthlessness and to this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=178.88s)]
*  day the american petty bourgeoisie have a significant effect on the divisions between [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=184.24s)]
*  the political left and the right if you want to make america a better place for everyone especially [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=188.16s)]
*  for minorities forget social activism instead start a business they not only provide opposition [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=192.64s)]
*  to labor-oriented reforms they also have served as the mass base for today's right-wing populism [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  which as we shall see reveal several of the same class patterns that we saw in german [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=203.92s)]
*  fascism consider the trump campaign and the maga movement for the purposes of this video i'm not [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  going to discuss whether it is fascist or not but it is today's leading form of right-wing populism [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=213.11999999999998s)]
*  the media often describes maga as a movement of the white working class and while its ranks do [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=218.72s)]
*  include many white workers i think this label overlooks the movement's middle class character [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=223.76s)]
*  data from primaries in 2016 for instance show that much of trump's support came from middle income [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=228.56s)]
*  voters whose average earnings were a lot higher than those of the average american and while [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=233.6s)]
*  income should not be equated with class it does serve as some preliminary indication but as a way [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=238.56s)]
*  of zooming into the class dynamics at play i'd like to focus on the january 6th capital riot [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=243.52s)]
*  as it's a particularly extreme expression of the maga movement and just as we'd expect the petty [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=248.56s)]
*  bourgeoisie namely small business owners and the self-employed were overrepresented among the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=253.52s)]
*  capital rioters there was a floral shop owner a ceo of a skydiving company owner of a chiropractor [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=258.24s)]
*  practice owner and president of a tax guidance company owners of real estate companies owner [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=263.92s)]
*  of a car dealership self-employed insurance agent ceo of a data analytics marketing firm [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=269.2s)]
*  and i could go on and on this social group was much more likely to be found among the capital [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=274.24s)]
*  rioters than among the general voting population and were even more overrepresented among those [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=278.72s)]
*  capital rioters who were violent trust me once you recognize this trend you never stop noticing it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=283.6s)]
*  while blue collar workers were present white collar workers were a lot more common and were [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=288.88s)]
*  also likely to be relatively high ranking managers who some categorize as petty bourgeois as well [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=293.36s)]
*  yeah so this is what i talked about a lot this was an hvac business owner riot right like that's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=299.36s)]
*  what it was for the most part of their increased status and the power they have over subordinate [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=305.28s)]
*  employees so it's completely misleading to see this event as a representation of the white working [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=309.68s)]
*  class let alone the general working class after all the rioters came from all over the united [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=314.8s)]
*  state people who were well off enough and had enough economic power to take time off work pay [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=320.0s)]
*  for traveling expenses whether by bus or plane as well as a hotel to stay in just to attend a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=324.88s)]
*  trump rally which is already some indication of its class character these were people who [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=329.52s)]
*  were drawn to the maga movement because they identified their individual freedom with the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=333.68s)]
*  freedom of business and saw all government efforts to help and assist the working class [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=337.6s)]
*  and the unemployed as obstructions to their personal success explaining their common [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=341.44s)]
*  resentment towards welfare recipients for instance because owning your own business [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=345.6s)]
*  represents freedom you are independent you are free and that's exactly the reason big government [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=349.76s)]
*  despise the american modern right wing movement also is very good at universalizing their [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  outwardly awful policies they never say we are here to defend big businesses they say [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=363.2s)]
*  small businesses are the backbone of american the american economy we're here to support small [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=370.16s)]
*  businesses when in fact their policy agenda is greatly beneficial for big businesses okay [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=375.52s)]
*  that's why when republicans talk about tax cuts they always talk about tax cuts for the middle [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=383.52s)]
*  class we're going to do tax cuts for the middle class we are going to help out the middle class [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=388.64s)]
*  deregulation is going to help out the middle class small businesses that is a lie what their outward [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  their what their open goal and as trump demonstrated in his 2017 tax cuts is to cut tax for the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=398.96s)]
*  wealthiest in american society and the corporations because of corporate tax rate there is a reason why [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=404.72s)]
*  in the trump tax cuts they came in the last trump regime the tax cuts made for the top [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=411.12s)]
*  earners in this country and the corporate tax rate were actually permanent whereas tax cuts for the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=419.12s)]
*  middle class and everything under the top marginal tax rate was actually slated the sunset all of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=425.36s)]
*  those tax cuts are supposed to sunset in 2026 i believe just so you understand that's not what [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=431.36s)]
*  the video is saying i don't care what the video is saying i'm giving additional context to the way [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=436.8s)]
*  in which america propagandizes american politicians and american political movements oftentimes [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=442.0s)]
*  propagandize certain positions that are inherently harmful to the middle class which is a very [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  specific designation that is supposed to take you away from understanding the class dynamic from [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  worker and capital owner to begin with okay but it's just something you need to understand [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=459.84s)]
*  both parties are also capitalists both parties also represent the interests of corporations [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  that's precisely the reason why the democratic party is directly at odds with its base of support [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=470.32s)]
*  sizes small business and yet at the same time as we saw with the german this also comes with attacks [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=476.08s)]
*  on big capitalists often represented by people like george sorrows and bill gates which often [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=482.0s)]
*  comes along with various about the collusion of left-wing protesters and labor unions with [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=486.96s)]
*  powerful elites like george sorrows that very same flavor of middle-class paranoia a phenomenon [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=491.2s)]
*  that is difficult to make sense of if we don't recognize its petty bourgeois character this also [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  helps us understand america's right libertarians who otherwise also seem hopelessly contradictory [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=501.2s)]
*  why is it that so many of them who are supposed to be anti-government end up moving towards [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  s*** once again the right libertarian movement is populated with a lot of petty bourgeois [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=511.2s)]
*  individuals who identify their freedom with unregulated business activity and attack the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=515.92s)]
*  government for its obstruction of this freedom and yet whenever their business begins being [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=520.24s)]
*  threatened either by the demands of organized labor or simply by the ruthless tendencies of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  the market they end up wishing for a strong government which would wield its iron fist [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=528.64s)]
*  in protecting their business against these threats recognizing it also helps us immensely [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=532.88s)]
*  in making sense of different responses to the covid pandemic among the ant the kind who equated [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=537.12s)]
*  social distancing with communism [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=542.08s)]
*  the petty bourgeoisie were you guessed it overrepresented in minnesota [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=546.72s)]
*  fine appealing to middle-class frustrations is the standard of living for what we think [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=550.88s)]
*  is middle class is only achievable for small business owners both parties never appeal to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=554.08s)]
*  the working class but only an amorphous intangible middle class that hasn't existed for decades [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=557.5200000000001s)]
*  exactly there is no real like straightforward worker i guess there is to a certain degree [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  it's like the professional managerial class okay there to a certain degree the professional [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=569.76s)]
*  managerial class like is a part of that equation like we're talking about we're talking about [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=575.12s)]
*  people with college degrees and whatnot the democratic party captures the attention of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  that base the republican party on the other hand captures the attention of the small business [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=586.16s)]
*  owners who actually receive what it looks like to be that mythical middle class but ultimately [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=590.16s)]
*  the notion of like the notion of of a group of individuals that like work in a fucking factory [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=599.2s)]
*  and have a house and have a comfortable meaningful existence with a single income [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=607.2s)]
*  like single income households with one with one person working as a wage laborer [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=613.5200000000001s)]
*  and being firmly in this like middle class standard is is non-existent in this country [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=620.48s)]
*  well those pleading to reopen the state during the pandemic were overwhelmingly small business [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=624.88s)]
*  owners proprietors of hair salons massage parlors a bowling alley vacation rental etc [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=630.08s)]
*  who put up slogans such as small business is essential and this makes sense as the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=635.36s)]
*  lockdown was impeding the profitability of their businesses in some cases to the point of bankruptcy [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=639.84s)]
*  also in some cases impeding their ability to spend their disposable income some protesters [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=645.04s)]
*  for instance expressed their dissatisfaction with the lockdown and their ability to make [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=649.68s)]

*  has but there are far more of these people out there working-class people wage laborers then [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=713.12s)]
*  there are small business owners okay and shade between the working class and the petty bourgeoisie [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=718.96s)]
*  if we want to understand the nature of different political movements and actions this is not to say [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=723.92s)]
*  that some small business owners did not have legitimate concerns the u.s government definitely [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=728.24s)]
*  did not act quickly and sufficiently enough to help those whose livelihoods were severely threatened [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  by the lockdown one legitimate concern was the fact that given america's privatized health care [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=736.8s)]
*  system many small business owners depend on the profitability of their business in order to pay [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=741.52s)]
*  for health insurance for themselves and their family the fight for universal health care is [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=746.0s)]
*  an example of an issue over which the workers and the lower middle class could potentially unite [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=750.0s)]
*  now while we do see these very clear patterns in the relationship between class and politics [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=754.48s)]
*  it is also true that today people vote according to their class a lot less than they did a hundred [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=758.96s)]
*  years ago and many of today's political divisions are drawn along lines of race are youtubers small [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  business owners yes absolutely yes technically myself included it's an owned and operated business [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=768.08s)]
*  so i still get paid for my labor and not for making others work for me i don't own like a channel [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  overall where like other people are working under me and and working like there is no way that i can [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=782.96s)]
*  continue making money if i just stopped streaming okay but yes technically youtubers especially [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=791.2s)]
*  many other youtubers that have like you know ginormous fucking businesses do this like they [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  are they are firmly within the small business owner category gender and culture and that is [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=806.32s)]
*  something that was actively and purposefully achieved by the ruling class which has always [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  tried to produce internal splits within the working class and to bring workers over to its [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=817.12s)]
*  side using cultural issues a tactic which in recent decades was especially pioneered by republicans [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=821.36s)]
*  and this is a problem because it points to a lack of class consciousness among workers [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=827.2s)]
*  which leads them to lash out against fellow workers what do you mean plenty of ways for you [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=831.52s)]
*  to make money if you don't stream yes of course but all but most of them like there are a million [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=834.4s)]
*  different ways that i can continue earning money off of the pre-existing the capital that i have [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=840.72s)]
*  capital accumulation is an avenue for me okay yes but that would change the dynamic of the way i [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=848.4s)]
*  are earned currently that would turn me into a capitalist rather than someone who still has to [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=855.84s)]
*  work to earn his income a lot of people misunderstand how this dynamic works and they [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  think for example athletes very wealthy right they get these massive contracts right so they [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=869.28s)]
*  go uh excuse me athletes are bourgeoisie okay and many of them are but not in the way that you think [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=876.24s)]
*  they are okay athletes is massive contracts they get from the the sports franchises they work for [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=882.8s)]
*  is still very much wage labor okay a lot of them then take that those contracts and turn around [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=892.24s)]
*  and start their own businesses in which in which they become capital owners business owners and [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=899.6s)]
*  therefore capitalists okay lebron james's endorsements and also his wages that he gets [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  from the los angeles lakers puts them in a wage laborer category okay whereas lebron james's many [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=913.4399999999999s)]
*  investments into other businesses puts them in a capitalist category that is how this works [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=920.8000000000001s)]
*  workers rather than those who actually exploit them this is not to say that the democrat party [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=927.9200000000001s)]
*  is free from blame either as it has been consistently disappointing the poor and working [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=932.4s)]
*  class for decades and has been thereby leaving people feeling like there is no worthwhile [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=936.48s)]
*  alternative the decline of class consciousness has been further intensified by what i would call the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  petty bourgeois of the working class the attempt to disarm class struggle by making workers [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=945.44s)]
*  identify more with the petty bourgeoisie than their own class this is seen when working class [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=950.48s)]
*  people see themselves as temporarily unsuccessful business people rather than workers entrepreneurs [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=955.2s)]
*  on the grind rather than sellers of labor power and this is exploited by various companies consider [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=960.72s)]
*  for instance uber which has utilized the slogan be your own boss although uber drivers are gig [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=965.84s)]
*  workers who are materially generating profit for uber uber tries to convince them that they are in [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=970.96s)]
*  fact self-employed bosses thus while offering them terrible working conditions they sell them the [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=975.44s)]
*  promise of being petty bourgeois and all of these problems are further confounded by a lack of [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=980.32s)]
*  genuinely working class organizations ones that would build working class autonomy and history [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=985.36s)]
*  shows us that few things are as effective in combating fascism as organized labor and now [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=990.4000000000001s)]

*  good example landlords yes landlords would be passive earning like earners passive income means [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=1001.28s)]
*  you do not have to go out and directly work to get a wage okay you do not have to go out and work to [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=1007.8399999999999s)]

*  i agree don't talk to them but because their distraction from the real fucking problem which [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=1309.04s)]
*  is that fascism arises because of the collapse of institutional legitimacy of liberal institutions [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=1314.4s)]
*  and that's how it's that's how we got fucking trump it's how we're going to get what's coming [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqMnQxpKLk&t=1322.4s)]
