# Chappell Roan Won't Endorse Kamala Harris | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68)
*  full-blown endorsing Kamala Harris because of her positions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm not comfortable fully endorsing Kamala Harris because of her, her like undying loyalty [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=3.2s)]
*  and commitment to continuing Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=10.64s)]
*  What? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=12.8s)]
*  Isn't that my person used to chase you around asking you not to call her a liberal amount? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=13.8s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  I don't know who that person is. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  I just woke up and to like people just skewing it even more. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=27.8s)]
*  Dorsing and voting are completely different. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=34.32s)]
*  I don't agree with a lot of what is going on with like policies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=35.84s)]
*  Like obviously, the policies of the right, but also some of the policies on the left. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=39.72s)]
*  That's why I can't endorse. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=45.2s)]
*  That's why I can't like put my entire name in my entire project behind one because there [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=47.08s)]
*  is no way I can. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=52.56s)]
*  I can stand behind some of the left's completely transphobic and completely views. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=55.08s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=61.92s)]
*  She's saying like the Democratic Party. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=62.92s)]
*  There are huge problems on both. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=65.6s)]
*  You know what is right and wrong. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=68.94s)]
*  And so do I. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Trump for real, but some of it that has gone down in the Democratic Party that has failed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  people like me and you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  And more so Palestine and more so every marginalized community in the world. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=77.52s)]
*  So no, I'm not going to put, I'm not going to settle for what the options that are in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=85.92s)]
*  front of me and you're not going to make me feel bad for that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  So yeah, I'm voting for Kamala, but I'm not settling for what has been offered because [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=94.92s)]
*  that's questionable. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=100.44s)]
*  It's questionable that our actions of our government, the actions of the internet, the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=102.1s)]
*  actions of you and me, if this is what you are not understanding, you know what? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=107.28s)]
*  Endorsing someone. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  If someone is publicly endorsing a political figure, that doesn't even mean that they're [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  going to vote for them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=116.8s)]
*  You need to interview her please. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=117.8s)]
*  I tried. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  I don't think it'll happen, but it's all good. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  But what's really funny about this take, what's really funny about this take is that like [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=122.82s)]
*  Chabal Ron is demonstrating one, I think like sound judgment on the matter. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  It's ironic because it's something that I experienced on a daily basis by annoying people. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=134.72s)]
*  And I think that a lot of the criticism is just like liberals who are Zionists themselves [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=139.2s)]
*  who try to couch their, who try to couch their criticism towards her with like lesser evil [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=146.28s)]
*  voting and like aesthetic posturing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=152.68s)]
*  But the real reasons why they're upset is because, you know, they can't say that they [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=155.3s)]
*  hate that she is pro Palestine. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=160.96s)]
*  That's I think what it is for a lot. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=164.08s)]
*  I'm sure there's like plenty of liberals who are automatically like blue, no blue, no matter [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=166.8s)]
*  who people, right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=171.28s)]
*  Like there are plenty of people who are blue, no matter who people who maybe even are pro [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=173.6s)]
*  Palestinian to, you know, to a degree, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=178.32s)]
*  But they're still team players and they've been conditioned into churning out this, like [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  why the won't you say you're going to vote for Kamala Harris and like swing loudly and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=186.2s)]
*  proudly for her UPC. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=189.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=190.72s)]
*  Beyond that, but beyond that, I think a big part of it is definitely from a lot of, yeah, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=191.72s)]
*  this is, I agree with this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=198.56s)]
*  I like take this opportunity to point out that a lot of people leading the hate against [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=200.6s)]
*  travel are Zionists. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=203.04s)]
*  The reason they're attacking her is because she used her platform to speak up about Palestine. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=205.28s)]
*  This is a very dangerous targeted hate campaign. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=208.12s)]
*  Watermelon ices. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  As soon as I see watermelon ices, I know for a fact that that is a fake account. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=217.52s)]
*  Watermelon ices doesn't care about Gaza or Palestinians. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=218.52s)]
*  They just hate Jews. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=220.36s)]
*  This is what the cowardly watermelons for Palestine should have been doing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=222.0s)]
*  I've been at this point with the pro Palestine movements is December of last year when those [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  protests ran up a gathering of black community leaders and punch one of our mothers in the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=228.64000000000001s)]

*  Okay. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  That person was, and there are definitely a lot of examples of such things as well. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm tired of artists like Chappell Rome profiting off of queer and drag culture and then refusing [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  to do the bare minimum when it comes to standing up for LGBTQ rights. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=246.08s)]
*  What has a mosque done for LGBTQ people in Palestine? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=248.8s)]
*  We don't govern Palestine. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=250.94s)]
*  Why should America's votes vote based on how Hamas treats Palestinian LGBTQ people? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=251.94s)]
*  The left's ability to not comprehend basic political and expecting a presidential candidate [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=257.18s)]
*  to not condemn supporters of a terrorist group must be studied. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=260.82s)]
*  Talk about pro Palestinian demonstrators there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=263.18s)]
*  I'm sorry, but there's no defending this guarantee. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=266.5s)]
*  This guy uses Zionists as a slur. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=269.14s)]

*  Chavarone is an embarrassment to lesbians because we support Israel in this house. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=282.58s)]

*  people who are like genuinely concerned about Chavarone's statements about the Democratic [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=332.17999999999995s)]

*  The first point I'm making is that a lot of people are couching their like classic harm [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=378.06s)]
*  reduction, uh, ask takes about the Democratic Party when it's when in fact they're just [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=383.62s)]
*  mad that she's saying that I, uh, that she's uncomfortable endorsing a candidate when she's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=387.86s)]
*  like voluntarily participating in the Palestinians, which is a perfectly reasonable and normal [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  take to have. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=399.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=400.98s)]
*  The second, the, the second sentiment that I would like to express here is that she is, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=401.98s)]
*  she is basically repeating something that like the overwhelming majority of under 30 [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=408.72s)]
*  year olds feel sure they might not be Twitter charpers with like a decent amount of followers [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=414.58000000000004s)]
*  on Twitter invested in the outcome of the Democratic Party because they fancy themselves [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=419.86s)]
*  to be Democratic Party mouthpieces or operatives. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=424.38s)]
*  But if you've ever interacted with someone under the age of 30, you know that this is [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=427.90000000000003s)]
*  precisely how they also feel. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=434.18s)]
*  And this is not the first election, nor it will be the last election where the under [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  age, uh, the under 30 demographic feels this way about the party when the party does not [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  even communicate or choose to communicate anything that is like functionally helpful [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  for the under 30 demographic of voters. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=454.48s)]
*  It's not like the Democratic Party has presented a solution to the problems that they perceive, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=457.48s)]
*  the problems that they're experiencing. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  So this attitude is actually quite commonplace. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=464.36s)]
*  So I don't even know how I don't really fully understand how people are yelling at her over [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=468.8s)]
*  this at all. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=474.0s)]
*  Because as I said in my other video, actually speak louder than words. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=475.0s)]
*  And I'm not going to let this narrative like me not playing both sides. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=478.52s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=482.04s)]
*  This is not me playing both sides. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=483.04s)]
*  This is me questioning both sides because this is what we have in front of us. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=485.6s)]
*  So if you look at and look at my statement and you're still like, she's just playing [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=489.76s)]
*  both sides like she doesn't want to know you're not getting it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=492.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=496.72s)]
*  Isn't like 80% of the Democrat position good for young people to be fair? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=497.72s)]
*  No. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=500.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=501.0s)]
*  Just stop asking this question and start telling me what you think is like good for young people. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=502.16s)]
*  OK, I'm critiquing both sides because they're both so up. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=506.88s)]
*  Voting is all we have right now in the system. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=510.36s)]
*  And so I encourage it yet again, vote for who in your mind is the best option for what [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=513.96s)]
*  we have right now, because it's all we can do. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=519.4s)]
*  And I hope this makes it clear that no, I'm not picking the sides of what we know. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=521.96s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=528.26s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=529.44s)]
*  They do not care. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=530.44s)]
*  They're going to literally relentlessly yelling at you and saying a vote for a vote for not [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=531.88s)]
*  Kamala is a vote for Trump, which you can. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=537.76s)]
*  Why is he calling me? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=540.4s)]

*  It seems I am here to see. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=552.96s)]
*  You sound great. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=560.64s)]
*  I feel like you're doing this thing where you like faking illness to get out of your [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=561.64s)]
*  work obligations to establish at least a line of evidence so you can get PTO on the next [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=565.68s)]

*  Oh, it's actually I'm not using my PTO hours. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=572.48s)]
*  I get five, six days a year. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=575.1999999999999s)]

*  You're not in the union. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=583.6s)]
*  Also, what's funny about this is you're voting for Trump, but your god queen Emperor Taylor [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=586.24s)]
*  Swift is in the tank for Kamala Harris. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=591.2s)]

*  You guys honestly do not deserve to win ever again twice or age purposely recording yourself [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=735.84s)]
*  in front of all your degrees to talk down her for expressing completely valid concerns [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=739.32s)]
*  exactly why no one under 30 wants to vote for the Democrats anymore. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=742.5600000000001s)]

*  Once obviously better than the other, but Jesus Christ, I hope you don't settle for [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=751.8800000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=763.76s)]
*  I mean, it makes total sense, dude. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=764.76s)]
*  Like endorsement is different than like going out and voting for someone anyway. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=766.36s)]
*  But beyond that, like if you want someone's vote or their endorsement, you have to earn [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=777.24s)]
*  This is the basis of democracy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=778.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=780.24s)]
*  That is what the democratic process is supposed to be about. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=781.24s)]
*  The Democratic Party has completely lost this attitude. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=785.48s)]
*  Like they've just like, and I'm not even talking about the party. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=788.88s)]

*  They act like you are against you are against the very notion of democracy. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=800.6800000000001s)]
*  If you don't if you don't immediately subscribe to one party over the other, this does not [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=805.46s)]
*  mean the other party is good. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=811.04s)]
*  The reality of the matter is if a vote not for Kamala Harris, the vote for Trump, a vote [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=812.64s)]
*  not for Trump is a vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=817.4399999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=819.56s)]
*  You know, if someone tells you that, oh, you don't want to vote for Kamala Harris, well, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=820.56s)]
*  you're voting for Trump then. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's like, no, I'm not voting for Trump. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=825.98s)]
*  Then I guess I'm voting for Kamala Harris. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=827.6s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=829.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, changes occur regardless. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=830.6s)]
*  And it is completely outside of our control. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=833.36s)]
*  Like the top of the hour ad break avoidance fee, which used to be $5. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=836.88s)]
*  And now it's $6 under brand inflation. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=841.04s)]

*  That's a misleading view of how voting with only two options is. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=851.8s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=854.24s)]
*  I'm just saying the exact same thing. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=855.52s)]
*  OK, I'm not voting for Trump. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=856.9599999999999s)]
*  OK, then a vote for not Trump is a vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=858.28s)]

*  I think it's fair to say I may have lower bar than other voters, but that isn't entirely [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=864.68s)]
*  higher bar. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=868.8s)]
*  That's the nature of a democracy. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=869.8s)]
*  I can cast a note while acknowledging that is a different issue from getting millions [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=870.8s)]
*  of others to cast votes to a lot of lips project their own preferences on the people, which [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=873.92s)]
*  is ridiculous and unrealistic. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=876.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's also not how this process works. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=878.16s)]

*  Let's see how the liberals are reacting to this. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=894.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm sure very normal. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=896.52s)]
*  Well, good morning. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=897.52s)]
*  This is a very clear attempt to not lose her right wing fan base. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=898.52s)]
*  What? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=903.92s)]
*  You have to be schizophrenic if you think that she has one, a right wing fan base and two [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=904.92s)]
*  is desperately trying to maintain her right wing fan base by being like, I have issues [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=912.96s)]
*  with the Democratic Party. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=917.8s)]
*  I hate Donald Trump. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=919.04s)]
*  I have issues with the Democratic Party. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=920.48s)]
*  saying I am trying to desperately because what she said is not all that different from [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=923.68s)]
*  what I say. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=929.2399999999999s)]
*  Obviously I have more information backing the things that I'm saying, but like beyond [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=930.2399999999999s)]
*  that, beyond that, like the it's like, but why not say Kamala? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=935.7199999999999s)]
*  She says she has a preference, obviously because she explained it well. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=941.2399999999999s)]
*  I don't think she wants to endorse Kamala Harris and considers it to be up. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=944.68s)]
*  It's what they do say as stupid as it is. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=948.7199999999999s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=951.4s)]
*  You ascribe the cynical reason as to why she came out and said this. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=952.4s)]
*  And it's kind of funny that you did that. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=956.76s)]
*  It's kind of, it's kind of funny that you did that because she says she doesn't want [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=958.72s)]
*  to endorse Kamala Harris. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=962.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=964.16s)]
*  Because there are still a lot of things that she does that or she has done that is, is, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=965.16s)]
*  you know, that is not in line with what she believes. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=971.92s)]
*  But why not support her fan base by endorsing someone who clearly supports policy that would [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=975.3199999999999s)]
*  help them because she's not. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=978.6s)]
*  Because she isn't, she isn't supporting policy that would help them. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=981.86s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=986.1s)]
*  You're just imagining if some of the policies you want are, Hey, I'm anti and Kamala Harris [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=987.1s)]
*  is like, well, I'm pro sorry. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=992.1800000000001s)]
*  Then that's directly at odds with what you're talking about. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=994.1s)]
*  You're just wishing that maybe there are some policies out there. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=996.9s)]
*  She made another tick tock where she says she's voting for Kamala and the, the libs [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1000.26s)]
*  bullied her into assuming the position of the, the libs bullied her into submission. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1004.02s)]
*  They will yell at her for not being enthusiastic enough. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1009.9s)]
*  Anyway, it doesn't work. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1017.98s)]
*  It doesn't work in this way. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1019.9399999999999s)]
*  Also yeah, like literally name one policy of Kamala Harris that is pro LGBTQ without [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1021.42s)]
*  mentioning what Donald Trump is going to do. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1027.78s)]
*  Name one policy of Kamala Harris that you think is good. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1029.98s)]
*  That isn't directly at odds. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1033.22s)]
*  That isn't like what she will magically do against Donald Trump is the 2016 trap that [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1036.14s)]
*  Hillary Clinton landed on as well. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1041.38s)]
*  Small business tax credits, moving the goalpost a bit. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1044.34s)]
*  Are we wait, what? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1047.14s)]
*  How was that moving the goalpost? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1048.58s)]
*  That is the goal and the pose that has been my goalpost. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1049.98s)]
*  Why do I ever, why do I do any political commentary? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1054.24s)]
*  If none of you listen to a single damn thing I'm saying, why do you think I'm so mad all [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1057.02s)]
*  the time about Kamala Harris not actively communicating what the true issues are, what [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1060.82s)]
*  so many, what so many Americans feel, what so many Americans experience and then communicating [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1067.26s)]
*  a way to solve those problems through what you would consider progressive, progressive [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1073.82s)]
*  policies, progressive economic policies. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1080.02s)]
*  There's nothing that is, there's nothing in our agenda that is like getting you to vote [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1082.48s)]
*  for her and everything in her agenda that is still reiterating the position that you're [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1088.28s)]
*  voting against Trump. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1092.68s)]
*  It's so funny to have this conversation also when the Democratic Party itself has moved [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1094.44s)]
*  the goalposts on immigration, which is why so many dumb who never actually gave a single [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1098.08s)]
*  shred of a fuck about immigrants at all are literally not even using that as a talking [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1101.84s)]
*  point because they're at least too embarrassed to use that as a talking point or too stupid [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1106.12s)]
*  to say, see, but Trump would be significantly worse on immigration. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1110.52s)]
*  Perhaps if that's the case, Kamala Harris should communicate that, no. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1114.18s)]
*  If this same exact conversation was happening in 2020, and it did actually not even was [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1117.08s)]
*  because people were like Hassan, why are you not enthusiastic about supporting Joseph Robin [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1123.1999999999998s)]
*  and Brandon? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1127.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1128.84s)]
*  And at the time there were other issues. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1129.84s)]
*  They would at least use immigration because Brandon had presented a pro immigrant agenda [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1131.4399999999998s)]
*  against Donald Trump's horrifying anti-immigrant policies. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1136.6799999999998s)]
*  Four years later, the Democratic Party has adopted Donald Trump's 2020 platform for immigration [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1140.96s)]
*  and now I don't hear the same charpers even bring up immigrants because it's simply a [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1147.16s)]
*  talking point for you. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1151.32s)]
*  It's not something that you genuinely care about. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1153.28s)]
*  Well, there is a little bit of truth in the harm reduction argument, the harm reduction [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1155.64s)]
*  counter, right? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1159.96s)]
*  Like in theory, you are not wrong. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1162.16s)]
*  Will Trump be worse than Kamala Harris? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1164.76s)]
*  Yes, of course Trump will be worse than Kamala Harris. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1166.68s)]
*  No, I'm talking about name one thing Harris. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1169.36s)]
*  That is a reason to not recognize Trump as a presidency would be a disaster for us who [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1171.2s)]

*  No trans speakers of the DNC, no mention of trans people in a Democratic Party platform. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1182.48s)]
*  You're just hallucinating a position for the Democrats that will defend you when they've [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1186.6000000000001s)]

*  trans people. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1203.98s)]

*  There you go. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1215.32s)]
*  And you don't think Trump would make it unimaginably worse. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1216.32s)]
*  You did it. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1217.88s)]
*  This is why I said name one thing that is pro you, okay, pro for you that the campaign [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1218.96s)]
*  is communicated about you or to you that does not involve what Donald Trump would do that [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1227.32s)]
*  would make things worse. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1233.76s)]
*  Because everyone here understands that reality. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1235.44s)]
*  I'm not one of these like acceleration is like, oh, no, I'm a mega communist type. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1238.0800000000002s)]
*  Like I'm not doing any of that. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1242.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1244.72s)]
*  I'm not doing any of that. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1245.72s)]
*  Name one thing that the Democratic Party knowing full well what the project 2025 platform looks [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1247.46s)]
*  like, for example, for trans people. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1251.94s)]
*  Name one thing. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1254.76s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1255.76s)]
*  Man, shut the up. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1256.76s)]
*  I've been a political commentator since you were in your daddy's ball sack. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1257.76s)]

*  Yeah, you're an accelerationist. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1267.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes, baby. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1268.6000000000001s)]
*  What you fail to consider is that this conversation is not about me and it's not about you. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1271.44s)]
*  This is how this is not how people vote. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1275.92s)]
*  People do not vote on harm reduction. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1277.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1279.96s)]
*  People make the choice to stay on the couch or go out and vote for a candidate. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1280.96s)]
*  It is up to the candidate and it is up to the party and it's up to the candidate run [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1285.2s)]
*  sure that those people that are sitting on the couch in normal elections, this couch [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1289.96s)]
*  is obviously the plurality of the voter eligible population to go out and vote for a candidate. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1294.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1300.76s)]
*  They're not doing that anyway. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1301.76s)]
*  Also, I'm obviously a foe and transphobic, just like chapel ron is. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1302.76s)]
*  That's why secretly or it is from my position of privilege. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1308.52s)]
*  It is from my position of privilege that I'm speaking out on these issues. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1313.44s)]
*  I'll ask you like this chatter. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1317.28s)]
*  If the Democratic Party actively communicated anti-trans legislation like they've done with [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1319.52s)]
*  immigrants, would you personally sit there and say, excuse me, the Democrats are still [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1324.3000000000002s)]
*  better than how bad the Republicans will be because it's expected that the Republicans [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1331.16s)]
*  will also be even worse than the Democrats, just like the Democrats have, you know, actively [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1335.7s)]
*  communicated anti-immigrant policies and the Republicans have gotten even worse on that [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1342.0800000000002s)]
*  front. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1345.8400000000001s)]
*  In that circumstance as a trans person, if you're a single issue voter and your issue [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1346.9199999999998s)]
*  is understandably trans existence, would you expect me as a political commentator who's [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1350.6799999999998s)]
*  on your side to sit idly by and say, well, Democrats are saying they want to trans people [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1355.6399999999999s)]
*  themselves and the Republicans are now saying they're going to put trans people in a machine [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1360.5s)]
*  to use them as bio matter. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1363.56s)]
*  One is a little bit worse than the other. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1365.4199999999998s)]
*  So I guess we have to make the mental calculation and say we're going to 30% of trans people [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1366.86s)]
*  sucks to suck. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1370.6s)]
*  Do would you expect me to say that for trans people or would you expect me to swing from [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1371.6s)]
*  the goddamn rooftops about how unimaginably insane it is that the Democratic Party has [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1376.8s)]
*  dropped the ball on yet another marginal group of people that they're supposed to be representing [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1381.36s)]
*  change for that are supposed to be defending. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1386.48s)]
*  That's the difference. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1388.72s)]
*  You don't give a fuck about Palestinians. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1389.72s)]
*  You're trans. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1391.32s)]
*  You think in your mind that Kamala Harris cares about you when she's not even made any [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1392.36s)]
*  assurances to you when she's not even said that she's going to defend you. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1396.8799999999999s)]
*  You don't care about Palestinians. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1400.6399999999999s)]
*  You don't care about Muslims. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1401.6399999999999s)]
*  You care about Arabs. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1402.6399999999999s)]
*  You don't care about immigrants. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1403.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1405.12s)]
*  These are things I care about and I care about trans people in the same exact way. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1406.6s)]
*  And if the Democratic Party was saying these exact same things and showing their their [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1409.8799999999999s)]
*  and demonstrating their their lack of interest in defending trans people I'd be swinging [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1415.52s)]
*  from the rooftops about that too. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1420.08s)]
*  Anyway, this person probably left. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1422.04s)]
*  How the hell is that a legitimate argument? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1423.52s)]
*  Yes, I recognize the best case vote for harm reduction. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1425.28s)]
*  OK, so you are saying as a trans person, if the Democratic Party platform tomorrow, because [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1427.4399999999998s)]
*  nobody cares about trans people in general, they're marginalized to begin with. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1435.1000000000001s)]
*  If the Democratic Party's platform in the same vein as immigration swung wildly to the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1439.06s)]
*  right. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1444.5s)]
*  OK. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1445.5s)]
*  And they were saying Republicans want 70 percent of trans people. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1446.5s)]
*  We want 30 percent of trans people. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1449.78s)]
*  You would say, yeah, 30 percent of trans people are going to die. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1451.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm voting for Kamala Harris. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1454.26s)]
*  Is that what you honestly would do in that situation? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1456.54s)]
*  A party that can so willingly cast aside the lives of millions of people living on US soil [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1459.26s)]
*  right now will absolutely drop you like a bad habit the moment they don't consider you [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1465.9s)]
*  to be advantageous. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1473.18s)]
*  OK. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1475.18s)]
*  And as a matter of fact, the Democrats kind of have already they have done very little [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1476.18s)]
*  to protect trans people in general. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1480.14s)]
*  As the Republican Party is that's not reality. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1482.66s)]
*  I am voting in this reality. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1484.66s)]
*  No, that is reality. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1485.94s)]
*  That is the reality for tens of millions of migrants living on US soil currently. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1487.62s)]
*  That is the reality for millions of Palestinians and their family members that live on US soil [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1491.54s)]
*  currently. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1496.46s)]
*  It's just not your reality because you don't give a **** about them. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1497.46s)]
*  This is what you don't understand. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1500.46s)]
*  That's why I changed the dynamic to what would you do if you were in the crosshairs? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1502.1799999999998s)]
*  You don't understand an analogy or how it works. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1508.6599999999999s)]
*  You don't care. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1511.48s)]
*  What the ****? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1512.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1513.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1514.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1515.78s)]
*  I gave you exactly what's going on and for you to understand it from your individual [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1516.78s)]
*  perspective as a trans person, I'm using the same exact thing that happened with migrants. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1521.82s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1526.58s)]
*  But this time instead of migrants, I'm swapping out migrants or trans person. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1527.58s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1532.78s)]
*  If the situation in front of you was that Democrats are saying we're going to 30% of [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1533.98s)]
*  trans people and the Republicans were saying we're going to 70% of trans people, would [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1539.5s)]
*  you still make the harm reduction argument? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1543.22s)]
*  Would you still endorse Kamala Harris? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1545.42s)]
*  Would you still turn around and yell from the rooftops that like Kamala Harris is a [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1547.8600000000001s)]
*  pro trans candidate? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1552.74s)]
*  You would not. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1554.14s)]
*  I don't know why we're having this argument. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1555.14s)]
*  You obviously would not because that's the reason why you're showing your lack of interest [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1556.78s)]
*  in all these other people and all these other groups in an effort to protect and preserve [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1562.38s)]
*  trans rights in your mind because you think the Democrats are going to do that. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1565.74s)]
*  She's better on all those issues. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1568.66s)]
*  This community is 15% trans and most of them share my opinion on the matter. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1573.9s)]
*  So I find it very funny when someone comes in here and it hits that like, well, I'm trans [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1579.46s)]
*  and you're not and they're going to me and you're privileged and that's why it doesn't [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1584.0600000000002s)]

*  Well, don't worry. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1592.42s)]
*  OK, don't worry. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1593.9s)]
*  When the time comes and the Democratic Party shows once again that they do not care about [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1595.74s)]
*  you either, as they haven't really even made a big assurance to defend your civil liberties [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1599.9s)]

*  Party with no one on the other side actually trying to fight back against that. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1634.06s)]
*  OK, that's what solidarity is about. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1639.62s)]
*  You don't understand that concept because you're a selfish American. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1643.1s)]
*  OK, you're a selfish, hyper individualistic, first world American individual. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1646.26s)]
*  OK, and you are operating like that, which is why I tried to use that selfish, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1652.58s)]
*  hyper individualistic attitude to help you understand what you're saying right now. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1657.46s)]
*  But it's not working. You're just never going to see it. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1661.98s)]
*  You're never going to experience it and you're never going to understand it. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1664.1000000000001s)]
*  It's fine. But a Democratic Party that voluntarily casts aside tens of millions of migrants [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1666.18s)]
*  living on US soil right now will absolutely not even think twice before dropping [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1671.1000000000001s)]
*  you from the platform. As a matter of fact, they already have. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1678.18s)]
*  They're doing that for Haitian migrants right now. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1680.58s)]
*  Haitian migrants are under attack nonstop left and right from the Republican Party. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1682.7s)]
*  They're not even standing in solidarity with them. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1686.62s)]
*  They're not even saying the things that they're supposed to say. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1688.4199999999998s)]
*  OK, liberals 10 years ago would at least be like, we're a nation of immigrants. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1691.26s)]
*  How dare you say that, sir? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1696.5s)]
*  That is, they've completely dropped that. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1697.86s)]
*  I don't even hear that. Kamala is the daughter of two immigrants. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1699.82s)]
*  OK, she is literally a direct product of American immigration and what it can be. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1705.78s)]
*  She is a living, breathing success story. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1712.3s)]
*  OK, I might not agree with, you know, a lot of the things that she has done, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1715.54s)]
*  but ultimately I see that reality. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1720.26s)]
*  It's in front of me. I see it with my own two eyes. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1723.02s)]
*  And she does not have the moral courage to stand there [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1724.98s)]
*  and even speak out against other black immigrants [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1729.62s)]
*  that are under attack by the Republicans. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1733.6599999999999s)]
*  Are you real? If a black woman can't even defend other black migrants [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1736.3799999999999s)]
*  that are under attack by insanely sentiment, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1742.26s)]
*  why the hell do you as a trans person think she's going to defend you? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1746.02s)]
*  You are hallucinating. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1750.54s)]
*  You're just literally hallucinating. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1752.86s)]
*  This is a careerist. That's it. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1754.78s)]
*  But fear not. In spite of all of this, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1756.74s)]
*  I still do perceive Kamala Harris as winning the upcoming election. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1760.18s)]
*  So don't worry. OK, your stay of execution will be granted. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1764.66s)]
*  You will have four more years as Republicans still make your lives [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1768.98s)]
*  living hell and the Democrats will do. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1772.3799999999999s)]
*  They'll throw their hands to the side and go. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1774.34s)]
*  There's nothing we can do about it. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1775.7s)]
*  The Senate parliamentarian stopped us or some. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1777.02s)]
*  Oh, the position of the Democratic Party cannot always be the position [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1779.06s)]
*  of the Democratic Party, cannot always and forever [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1784.34s)]
*  be. We are not the Republicans. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1790.14s)]
*  Chatter is 100 percent correct to be concerned. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1792.34s)]
*  You appeasing language in the trans folk regularly now and you're on them [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1794.54s)]
*  for five minutes for not having solidarity. Absolutely deranged. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1797.26s)]
*  No chatter. You're deranged because you literally do not hear the words [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1800.02s)]
*  that are coming out of my mouth. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1804.18s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1806.46s)]
*  I gave you another example of the Republican Party currently actively, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1808.3s)]
*  actively using language somehow even more so than they use [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1813.14s)]
*  against trans people, against Haitian migrants. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1817.66s)]
*  A Democratic Party that does not address and counter [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1821.18s)]
*  those talking points is a Democratic Party that does not give up. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1825.9s)]
*  I can buy you either. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1829.02s)]
*  OK. And for the record, I don't even care if you want to vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1830.1s)]
*  Vote till the cows come home. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1834.94s)]
*  Vote every day. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1837.42s)]
*  Vote illegally if you can. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1838.6200000000001s)]
*  OK, get the mules ready to go, baby. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1840.66s)]
*  I don't give it. But if you come in here and tell me that I'm wrong for this assessment. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1843.3s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to lie to you. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1849.3s)]
*  OK, I'm going to be brutally honest with you. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1850.9s)]
*  OK, sorry. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1853.34s)]
*  It's just the goddamn truth. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1854.74s)]
*  OK, yes, they are doing it in both cases. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1856.34s)]
*  That doesn't really change the thing about the danger posed here, doesn't it? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1858.94s)]
*  It doesn't. So once again, your opinion here is that, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1862.14s)]
*  no, they will do the right thing, even though they haven't yet. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1866.94s)]
*  But they probably will. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1869.74s)]
*  No, you're not wrong about the assessment. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1871.3s)]
*  You're just being asked someone who doesn't deserve it. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1872.9s)]
*  No, I think that I think that people need to wake up to that reality [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1874.6200000000001s)]
*  quicker rather than later, because if you wake up to that reality [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1878.94s)]
*  and you demand change, hopefully, maybe one day [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1882.5s)]
*  the Democratic Party will be more responsive to that. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1885.42s)]
*  OK, first DNC since 2012 without a trans speaker, by the way. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1887.9799999999998s)]
*  I know that's why it's so funny where people will be like, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1891.54s)]
*  well, I'm trans in like one of the largest trans communities online. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1894.34s)]
*  Coming in here being like, well, I'm trans. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1898.26s)]
*  And because of that, I think you're your privileges showing, sweetie. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1900.6599999999999s)]
*  Like get out of here. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1905.02s)]
*  What does the Democratic Party have even said about trans people? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1905.78s)]
*  I don't think they think she's going to defend us. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1913.74s)]
*  Most trans arguments for harm reduction are generally 80 percent [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1915.46s)]
*  Hitler versus 101 percent Hitler trying to get stabbed 20 times [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1917.94s)]
*  versus 50 times because we know what's coming. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1920.78s)]
*  Regardless exactly. And that's incredibly frustrating. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1922.22s)]
*  But my but I hope that trans people in this community know [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1925.26s)]
*  and expect someone like myself to go out to bat for you. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1929.82s)]
*  Unconditionally, when the Democratic Party doesn't communicate [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1934.06s)]
*  any kind of like active policy prescription to make your lives [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1938.82s)]
*  a little bit better. OK. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1943.14s)]
*  Like, that's my point. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1945.3s)]
*  And I'm doing that right now for people who have family members over there [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1946.78s)]
*  in Palestine and Lebanon, who are getting merciless, mercilessly [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1951.58s)]
*  bond with our tax dollars. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1954.5s)]
*  And I'm doing that right now in the same exact way that I would do it [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1956.42s)]
*  for trans people. I'm doing that right now for migrants living on U.S. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1959.3799999999999s)]
*  soil that have no other outlet or avenue that will defend them. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1962.86s)]
*  That's it. So it would be ridiculous for me to drop any one of these [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1967.3s)]
*  marginalized communities because I'm making an electoral calculus. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1971.46s)]
*  And I'm also warning you, I hope you understand, like I'm giving you a warning. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1975.46s)]
*  The Democratic Party basically sees you as a nuisance. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1979.8600000000001s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1984.14s)]
*  They don't even want to be like associated with you. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1985.3000000000002s)]
*  They don't want to put you up as a goddamn speaker, the DNC, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1987.5s)]
*  because they don't want to be associated with you. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1990.8600000000001s)]
*  They think you are political poison. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1992.8600000000001s)]
*  OK. And a party that doesn't even aesthetically defend you [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1995.42s)]
*  is certainly not going to defend you on the legislative side, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=1999.7s)]
*  as is clear from some of the worst aspects of trans [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2002.94s)]
*  anti-trans legislation coming under the Biden administration through state legislatures. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2007.94s)]
*  So my argument for you is instead of coming in here and yelling at me, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2023.14s)]
*  someone who is your ally, someone who is on your side, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2027.58s)]
*  someone who wants the best for you, someone who wants your material conditions to improve. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2031.5s)]
*  Go yell at the Democratic Party, which seemingly doesn't want to hear [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2035.8999999999999s)]
*  what you have to say, which is why you find that to be a senseless effort of futility, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2039.22s)]
*  which is precisely the reason why you're in here yelling at me, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2045.22s)]
*  because that makes you feel better. That's it. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2047.78s)]
*  It comes from a place of powerlessness. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2050.62s)]
*  That's what you are experiencing right now. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2053.62s)]
*  Powerlessness, because the Democratic Party communicates over and over again [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2055.7s)]
*  that they don't give a **** about you. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2060.18s)]
*  You better vote for them and shut the **** up. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2061.22s)]
*  OK. And that's it. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2063.34s)]
*  And because you feel utterly powerless in front of this giant machine, right, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2065.18s)]
*  that does not care about your well-being even a little bit, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2072.34s)]
*  you have to delude yourself into thinking that you're moving the needle [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2076.82s)]
*  in a positive direction by yelling at someone who can hear you, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2080.22s)]
*  because you feel like there is a little bit of change at least you can have, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2083.9s)]
*  or at least you can like release a pressure valve here, you know, get it off your chest. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2087.8199999999997s)]
*  And that's it. That's that's why so many people beyond like the Zionists [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2093.2599999999998s)]
*  that are couching their harm reduction arguments by launching these like ridiculous [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2097.38s)]
*  attacks against Chabal Ron are doing the same thing. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2100.8599999999997s)]
*  They're doing the same thing. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2105.38s)]
*  Like there's a lot of liberals who are just like yelling at her [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2106.58s)]
*  because they just feel like they are utterly powerless in the face [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2108.5s)]
*  of this goddamn death machine that they that is hell bent on death and destruction [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2112.42s)]
*  that they know deep down inside do not care about their well-being. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2117.42s)]
*  OK. Watching Chabal Ron over explain herself after being misunderstood, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2121.78s)]
*  but she doesn't know these people aren't looking for an explanation. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2125.38s)]
*  They already made up. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2128.06s)]
*  They already made their minds up about her. Oh, honey. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2129.9s)]
*  Yep. Anyway, that's why it's funny when you think about like, oh, yeah, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2132.34s)]
*  just watch Chabal Ron reasonably argue that she would like better candidates. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2136.82s)]
*  Well, she clearly stating she thinks Harris is the better candidate [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2140.02s)]
*  then read endless comments from Harris supporters saying Ron is an idiot. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2141.98s)]
*  This is called behavior. She's on your side. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2144.5s)]
*  Why demand absolute loyalty? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2145.86s)]
*  Because once again, they feel powerless. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2147.46s)]
*  That's it. So they want to yell at someone. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2150.42s)]
*  They want to yell at someone so they feel better. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2153.3s)]
*  Twitter is the only place where well articulated sentences still get misinterpreted. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2156.18s)]
*  You could say, I don't agree with Kamala's policies. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2160.22s)]
*  And someone will say, so you're a Republican and support Trump. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2161.94s)]
*  No, that's a whole new sentence. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2164.06s)]
*  What the fuck is he talking about? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2165.3s)]
*  Yeah. Pronouncing Kamala's name is Kamala. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2166.82s)]
*  It was all I needed to know about Chabal Ron and ignore her views forever. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2170.62s)]
*  Just loud and dumb rise and fall of a Midwestern clown. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2173.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Jake Tapper name searches, it seems. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2176.1s)]
*  At least be man enough to tag me with your lies, Matt. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2180.02s)]
*  The fact that Tapper Greenblatt and others can engage in a multi-day [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2182.94s)]
*  defamation campaign against Rashida to leave by blatantly miscoding her [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2185.54s)]
*  and face zero repercussions for it is a great example of the institutional [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2188.7799999999997s)]
*  anti-Palestinian bias she called out in the first place. Great take. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2191.9s)]
*  Like his profile link, if protesting the vote doesn't move them's left [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2194.58s)]
*  and voting based on harm reduction doesn't work, then what do we do? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2198.38s)]
*  What options of substance do we have? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2200.7s)]
*  How do we stop being powerless? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2202.54s)]
*  You you work locally and you try to improve. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2204.1s)]
*  You organize, you work locally and you try to improve your material [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2207.94s)]
*  conditions one step at a time for those around you. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2211.3s)]
*  That's the only thing you can do. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2213.9s)]
*  And hope that this network of organization will inevitably [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2216.1s)]
*  be able to create a pressure point for at least one of the two parties. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2220.54s)]
*  OK, I love how Chad will get mad about you voting [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2226.54s)]
*  while you've literally donated with the community and done more for trans people [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2229.54s)]
*  than the Democratic Party has in the last four years. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2232.02s)]
*  Yeah, but it is what it is. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2234.02s)]
*  You know, I'm transphobic, as you guys know. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2236.14s)]
*  And it's so funny because Chabal Ron also does that, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2238.34s)]
*  like her ticket sales or merch sales, like she does fundraisers [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2241.3s)]
*  through her work, directing it to directing it [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2246.7799999999997s)]
*  to Palestinian aid groups and LGBTQ aid groups. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2251.38s)]
*  Like that's why it's hilarious when people are like, yeah, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2255.74s)]
*  you're not sufficiently pro LGBTQ. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2258.7s)]
*  Fuck the policies of the right. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2261.3799999999997s)]
*  All right. We're on the same page on that one. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2263.18s)]
*  But also some of the policies on the left. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2265.06s)]
*  Oh, now you lost me. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2268.02s)]
*  That's why I can't like put my entire name in my entire project behind one. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2269.14s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of how voting works right now in America. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2275.2599999999998s)]
*  Sick. If you met her, I just know you would vibe. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2277.9399999999996s)]
*  OK, guys, stop being parasocial. All right. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2280.74s)]
*  So, yeah, I'm voting for Kamala. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2283.9399999999996s)]
*  All right. We're back on the same page. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2286.4199999999996s)]
*  It's pronounced Kamala, though. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2288.3s)]
*  You know what? Endorsing someone. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2289.86s)]
*  If someone is publicly endorsing a political figure, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2292.26s)]
*  that doesn't even mean that they're going to vote for them. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2295.3s)]
*  I mean, what's what's the strategy behind that? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2297.82s)]
*  I mean, after the primaries, I don't I don't think that's a thing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2300.78s)]
*  I don't think there's any benefit to a corporation [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2304.7000000000003s)]
*  or person endorsing a candidate in a general election and not actually doing it. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2307.7400000000002s)]
*  So you're losing me again. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2312.1400000000003s)]
*  No, no, no. This is not me playing both sides. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2314.02s)]
*  Sure about that. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2317.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm critiquing both sides because they're both soaked up. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2318.9s)]
*  I think a big part of it, too, is that the Libs recognize that you're right. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2322.2200000000003s)]
*  But rather than get mad at the Dems, they get mad at waking them up [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2325.06s)]
*  from the collective dream of Dems being the good guys. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2328.1400000000003s)]
*  No, I don't think that's the idea of dog tag. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2330.5s)]
*  I think that's just the star of David. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2332.7000000000003s)]
*  IDF dog that the IDF dog tags are much larger chat. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2335.42s)]
*  Chill. Yeah, sounds like you're playing both sides. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2339.1400000000003s)]
*  Voting is all we have right now in the system. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2341.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, that kind of is the system of democracy. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2345.58s)]
*  But yeah, there's a lot more you could do in between elections. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2348.34s)]
*  I think he's a doctor, but yeah, he is a doctor to being a god. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2351.14s)]
*  We know your mega hat is off screen. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2355.38s)]
*  I mean, it literally is. Hold on. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2357.02s)]
*  What now, liberals? What now? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2358.86s)]
*  The truth is out. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2361.78s)]
*  I encourage it yet again. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2363.38s)]
*  Vote for who in your mind is the best option for what we have right now. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2365.54s)]
*  Yeah, Kamala Harris is definitely our best option. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2370.78s)]
*  I can't watch the rest of this guy. So annoying. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2373.74s)]

*  I wear this hat. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2379.82s)]
*  Let me tell you why I wear this hat. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2381.1s)]
*  I wear this hat because he won the 2020 election and I'm not afraid to say it. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2382.38s)]
*  He won the 2020 election. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2386.74s)]

*  Also, the Trump vans ad is actually too gross. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2414.06s)]
*  Why did it take so long for you to grab your MAGA hat? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KJw3FKBG68&t=2416.46s)]
