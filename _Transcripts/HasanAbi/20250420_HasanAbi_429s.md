*  I extensively talked about throwing up the gray Wolf sign and they got really mad at [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThBiw_47OWk&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  me for saying it was an ultra nationalist symbol. Yeah. What I saw on throwing up the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThBiw_47OWk&t=17.6s)]
*  gray Wolf sign a terrorist organization. Yeah. That's what I was doing and not rock and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThBiw_47OWk&t=28.42s)]
