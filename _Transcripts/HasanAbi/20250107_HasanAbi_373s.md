*  Can you cosplay this? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8rrMSbjwHs&t=134.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm trying to do a cosplay before we go to Japan for Marvel Marvel Rivals, but it's so all the characters are so sick. I don't know who to like actually cosplay as but I hit up Emeru for me and Will to do cosplay. We could potentially do Mr. Fantastic. I don't know.
