*  additional necessary measures among the protesters demands that the school wait, this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=0.0s)]
*  scary pamphlet students, faculty and staff and works at Columbia university and all people [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=5.22s)]
*  of conscious demand immediate research. Yeah. We've already read these demands yesterday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=9.68s)]
*  Ain't no anyway, getting back to the hellish nightmare of American reality. Propel scene [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=14.4s)]
*  demonstrations held at Barnard college city college in New York city. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=24.72s)]
*  Tense situation unfolding outside city college in upper Manhattan. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=28.08s)]
*  Dozens of pro Palestinian demonstrators are on the move after earlier refusing to leave the area. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=32.0s)]
*  Derek Waller is live near 141st street in combo with the very latest. Derek, what is happening now? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=36.8s)]
*  Chris, Christine, a lot going on. These protesters are actually just here a couple minutes ago and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  actually just made their way west up convent and behind me you see they've got these barricades [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=46.64s)]
*  here. Police down the block here at city college basically trying to keep these protesters from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  coming back. This was a tense situation. Take a look at this video shot really just a few moments [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=56.16s)]
*  ago. This is what it looked like. It's police clashed with those demonstrators. We saw at least [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  one person even get arrested. It's unclear what led to that specific arrest, but the protests [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=66.56s)]
*  started actually at Barnard college and then continued here. This pro Palestinian group is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=71.6s)]
*  upset with Barnard administrators who expelled the two students. Police sources say distributed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=78.0s)]
*  hateful flyers during a class about Israel and so Barnard is refusing to bring those students back [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=83.68s)]
*  into classes. Now I can tell you again right now those protesters have moved west away from [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  where we're standing. Unsure where they were headed, but the situation here has remained [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=96.56s)]
*  largely peaceful, but it was incredibly tense for some time. Reporting live here by city college, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=102.0s)]
*  Daryl Waller, CBS News New York. Okay, Derek thank you and also the governor having to cancel [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=109.12s)]
*  an event there at city college tonight due to this situation there and of course this all does [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  come as we continue to wait to hear if students who assaulted that Barnard public safety worker [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=119.2s)]
*  last night and took control of a building will be disciplined. Lisa Rosner has more on what's led up [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=124.72s)]
*  to all of this campus unrest. Thursday outside the entrance to Barnard college police warned. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=130.0s)]
*  Yeah show us the scary materials. I would love to see. I would love to see what these scary [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  materials they were posting. They never show it even even with like all of the campus encampments. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  They would literally pan to like someone saying like Zionists or fascists or something and they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=149.84s)]
*  would pan to that and be like see look at this terrifying image on college campuses. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=155.68s)]
*  Look at what the children are doing. You know, Palestinian demonstrators to stop blocking [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  because this was the material. Wait let me see this. Any claims about Barnard college that they [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=165.44s)]
*  didn't promise student amnesty or a live video from the inside mill bank with faculty confirming [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=170.4s)]
*  amnesty for students. Sorry the first. Wait let me see the pamphlet. Chatter where the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=173.6s)]
*  did you send this to me? Where's the pamphlet? PDF of Epstein files have been released. Chatter [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=178.88s)]
*  it has been released for decades. OK for a goddamn decade. It's not new. Columbia wants [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=183.36s)]
*  you to forget what we built together. What is public safety protecting from to liberate our [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=190.0s)]
*  country to have dignity to have respect to have our mere human rights is something as essential [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=194.88s)]
*  as life. Gossang kind of funny unbelievable levels of anti-semiticism happening on these [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=198.8s)]
*  in college campuses. I don't think that this was it though. There's got to be another one [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=205.12s)]
*  that says Columbia though. They show it where where did they show the scary pamphlets in the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=209.12s)]
*  CBS industry and traffic and get off the sidewalk. If you refuse to I know Barnard is a part of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  Columbia. What the fuck are you talking about? I've literally interviewed students from the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=220.4s)]
*  Columbia encampment. This comes after Wednesday night when a group staged a sit-in inside mill [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=225.36s)]
*  bank hall for nearly seven hours. The Transport Workers Union says a 41 year old security guard [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=231.36s)]
*  at the entrance was pushed and shoved during their stampede into the building. Student Shoshana [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=236.8s)]
*  Afzian was already inside. It was frightening. I think they should have called NYPD and the second [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=242.72s)]
*  it got violent. Barnard said the masked protesters left after the school sent final written notes [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  to consider additional necessary measures among the protesters demands that the school. Wait this [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  is the scary pamphlet. Students faculty and staff and workers at Columbia University and all people [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  of conscious demand immediate reserve. Yeah we've already read these demands yesterday. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=262.48s)]
*  Ain't no fucking way that that was the pamphlet. Wait this is the pamphlet. I'm done. Get the fuck [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=267.76s)]
*  out of here. Columbia cannot tolerate this kind of behavior. I'm done. I'm done. I can't eat cheese [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=274.32s)]
*  anymore. Me either. It's the psychological trauma that I withstood from seeing the the most the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  scariest pamphlet of all time. One of posters accusing university affiliates displayed throughout [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=290.08s)]
*  campus. What is this November 13th 2024. No this isn't what you're talking about. This is [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  entirely separate chatter. This is literally campus times from Rochester New York. Look what CBS [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=300.96s)]
*  shows at 237. School dropped the expulsions of two students who police sources say last month [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=308.56s)]
*  disrupted an Israeli studies class. No. Oh just just crush the star of David. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=315.76s)]
*  Context no context. Yeah crush. What could it what could this word be under here. Maybe they're [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=323.36s)]
*  saying crush Jewish people. Maybe that's what they're maybe that's what they're saying. How [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=329.92s)]
*  are you supposed to criticize the state of Israel that's doing a right. They got the goddamn star [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=334.8s)]
*  David on there. What do you what do you what are you supposed to do. Nope sorry that's anti-Semitic. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=339.76s)]
*  I can't believe you're criticizing the state of Israel class and distributed. No they don't pan [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=346.0s)]
*  down to the NYPD deemed a bias incident. Burn Zionism the group which the NYPD deemed a bias [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=352.48s)]
*  incident. You have posters that talk about his father and stamping on the Jewish star and wars [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=360.56s)]
*  this all could have been avoided if I were just enforced its rules. We approached dude. Columbia [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=365.52s)]
*  is literally deporting students. OK expelling American students for criticizing the state of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=370.0s)]
*  Israel and these guys over here are like nope that's really tough. Yeah we can't criticize [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=376.64s)]
*  Saudi Arabia or the Taliban led Afghanistan because they have the Shahada on their flags. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah no can't do that can't do that. God forbid. I mean dude Mecca is there. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=384.96s)]
*  Excuse me excuse me how dare you criticize Saudi Arabia. The holiest place on the planet for [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=392.4s)]
*  Muslims is in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the singular most important place on the planet for [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=399.12s)]
*  Islam. How dare you how dare you criticize Saudi Arabia. No they should get more weapons. They [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=405.44s)]
*  should get nukes. We should give them nukes. If you say they shouldn't get nukes you're Islamaphobic. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=410.88s)]
*  If it's a real poster it's pretty dumb to add the star of David. Israel's not a representative of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=415.44s)]
*  Judaism. Yeah it's the Israeli flag chatter. What do you mean. What do you what do you talk [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=418.88s)]
*  about. What do you think that means. What is this crush Zionism. And it's the UN boot. You just but [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=423.68s)]
*  people are going to unironically agree with that Saudi take. Yeah in a couple of years when they [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=429.12s)]
*  when they finish the the charm offensive once one Saudi Arabia finishes his charm offensive [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=432.88s)]
*  that will unironically be the tag. They'll be like dude this is Islamophobia. Excuse me. America is [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=438.48s)]
*  a Judeo Islamic Christian nation. Only the Saudi style of Islam though. Just kidding that'll never [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=443.44s)]
*  happen. Come on anyway. Oh yeah. Multiple students demonstrators but none of them would talk on camera [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=449.68s)]
*  and told us to send an email. The students are protesting non-violently and they're being [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=457.28s)]
*  viciously suppressed under the false excuse of anti-Semitism when opposing Israel is not anti-Semitism. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=463.84s)]
*  The purpose of that sit-in was to demand the reinstatement of two expelled students who [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=473.28s)]
*  challenged the professor of that class who was promoting you know the standpoint of Israel. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=479.52s)]
*  A meeting between school administrators and some demonstrators was tentatively set for 1 p.m. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=487.52s)]
*  Thursday but there's no word yet. Yeah to contextualize it would be like if the flyers distributed saying [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=492.88s)]
*  crush Nazism and featured a swastika under a boot and the news ran with the framing anti-Hindu hate [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=498.48s)]
*  crime posters were distributed on a college campus. Yeah like it's just it's so ridiculous. I think [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  Mohammed El-Kurd has an interesting take on this. She said Jews because that's how they define [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=510.0s)]
*  themselves. Mistranslating this implies that stating the obvious is somehow problematic. It's [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=513.84s)]
*  not her fault that the self-proclaimed Jewish state is committing the crime is not the language. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=517.12s)]
*  Of course the telegraph is doing this in bad faith hence making out jihad to be its own scary word [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=521.84s)]
*  and not simply a word that means struggle but in Palestine and in Israeli discourse that's how both [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=526.4s)]
*  people refer to themselves and each other Arabs and Jews and there's a lot to be said about the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  many many ironies in such a reductive language e.g. some Israeli soldiers are Muslims some [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=534.64s)]
*  Mizrahi Jews are Arab etc. But pretending it is somehow scandalous that a woman from the region [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  would refer to things by their colloquial names is beyond absurd. It's willful misinterpretation. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=543.36s)]
*  Khalas. Yeah this is the yeah BBC Remove references the Jews and jihad and Gaza documentary. That's [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=548.16s)]
*  what they were saying. Oh yeah. I want to look at Ethan Klein's family members and what they're [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=553.68s)]
*  saying on Twitter. I don't give a shit. He actually speaks to Amy Goodman about this and explains it [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=558.9599999999999s)]
*  very well. Check it out. Yeah I mean he wrote he wrote this article on Mondo wise Jewish settlers [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  stole my house. It's not my fault that they're Jewish. That's what Mohammed El-Kurd wrote in [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=569.92s)]
*  September 26th 2023. Or as we use dwarf the decades of violence enacted against us by the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=575.04s)]
*  self proclaimed Jewish state. A drone is one thing but a trope a trope is unacceptable. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=579.04s)]
*  No more like the the interpretation the interpretation from the region and the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=584.16s)]
*  actual like anti-Israel sentiment and the language utilized when talking about Israel [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  referring to Israel as Jewish people in the region directly comes from the fact that Israel says [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=596.88s)]
*  they're doing this for Judaism. OK. When you're fucking stamping the Star of David on prisoner [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=602.16s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners faces when you're literally using tanks when you're literally using tanks to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=608.32s)]
*  fucking to draw the Star of David on destroyed Palestinian homes on a lot that used to have [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=613.84s)]
*  Palestinian apartment complexes when you're fucking putting up in the beginning of Hanukkah [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  putting up the fucking menorah a ginormous menorah in the midst of your genocide without feeling a [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=627.84s)]
*  sense of shame at all about this false association with Judaism. Yeah of course people are going to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DdbO_ZGnzo&t=633.84s)]
