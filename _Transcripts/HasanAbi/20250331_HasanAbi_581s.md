# The Greenlanders Caught Between Both Denmark And US | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc)
*  You can't just like come in. You can't just come in and be like, that's it. I'm taking it. Greenland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=0.0s)]
*  is mine. It's mine. It's not even green. They lied. We're going to take it and we're going to turn [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=7.2s)]
*  it into white land. Why do they call it greenland? There's no green. It's all white. You can't [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=12.32s)]
*  imperialism like that. You have to do a delicate. You have to do a delicate touch. You have to be [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=17.84s)]
*  like, these people desperately want to be saved from the colonial occupation of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=22.32s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=30.0s)]
*  President shocking, shocking revelations coming from Donald Trump. Only shocking if you're, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=32.4s)]
*  you know, only shocking if you're oblivious, only shocking if you've gotten a healthy dose of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=39.6s)]
*  liberal propaganda. You're like, what? I can't believe it. How is he saying these things? What [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=47.44s)]
*  do you mean? They're never going to join NATO. It's like, if you thought that Biden, for even [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  a brief moment was entertaining the notion sincerely behind closed doors that, that what [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=56.08s)]
*  do you call it? They were going to let Ukraine into NATO. You were wrong. Okay. You have been [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=63.6s)]
*  duped my friends. And I told you this over and over again. And for that reason, everyone kept [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=70.0s)]
*  saying Hassan, you love Lottie poo. You are, you love Adolf Pootler. You are the biggest fan of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=75.68s)]
*  Adolf Pootler. Yeah. I don't know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Please don't listen to Hassan. He [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=81.76s)]
*  doesn't know what he's talking about. Listen to me instead guy who's wrong all the time, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=87.84s)]
*  but at least he's wrong in the direction of the American state department and the American [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=92.4s)]
*  mainstream press. So you don't really understand that he's wrong until things happen like this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=96.48s)]
*  And you go, wait, how could I have been so off base with this analysis? Well, you know, maybe [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=101.12s)]
*  you should think long and hard on that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  Trump's belligerent remarks over the weekend have only served to increase anxiety here. And it's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  entirely unnecessary. The Americans had 10,000 troops here in several bases at the height of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=116.48s)]
*  the Cold War. And the Danish government and Greenlandic politicians have been completely [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=123.12s)]
*  clear that if the Americans are concerned about the Chinese threat, they could build that force [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  up again. As for the people here in Greenland, well, they are scared. They live a traditional [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=134.56s)]
*  way of life. Now in the story we're about to show, you're going to see a picture of a seal, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  which is dead. That is the traditional life here, hunting and fishing. People don't want to lose [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  that way of life. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=153.2s)]
*  We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And I think we're going [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  to get it one way or the other. We're going to get it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=163.52s)]
*  Surely the world's largest island, an autonomous territory within Denmark and a fine piece of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=168.4s)]
*  seafront real estate must be on the market for the right price. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=175.28s)]
*  Trump says he wants to bias like we were common. I'm sorry to say that, but I got so angry. I think [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=180.4s)]
*  it's so disrespectful to the Inuit people of Greenland to be treating us this way, to walk in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=187.2s)]
*  like we are. See if a liberal, if a liberal administration was overseeing the potential [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=195.2s)]
*  annexation of Greenland and don't say that that would never happen under a liberal administration, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=202.88s)]
*  this would be the exact opposite. Okay. USAID backed USAID subsidized NGOs be on the ground [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  desperate to find any like in to build civil society organizations. This takes time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  You can't just like come in. You can't just come in and be like, that's it. I'm taking it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=225.28s)]
*  Greenland is mine. It's mine. It's not even green. They lied. We're going to take it and we're going [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=231.84s)]
*  to turn it into white land. Why do they call it Greenland? There's no green. It's all white. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=237.28s)]
*  You can't raw dog imperialism like that. You have to do a delicate. You have to do a delicate [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=242.08s)]
*  touch. You have to be like these people desperately want to be saved from the colonial occupation of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  Denmark. We must, we must focus on indigenous rights. We must focus on indigenous sovereignty [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  in Greenland. Indigenous Greenlanders are on the side of American annexation. America will [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=259.92s)]
*  liberate Greenland from the treacherous grips of Danish colonial occupation. Like that's, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=264.8s)]
*  that is how they're supposed to do it. But these guys are so horny that they're basically like, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=272.08s)]
*  no, we're taking it. We're taking it. What are you going to do about it? No foreplay, dude. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=276.72s)]
*  No foreplay. Educated, unknowing people who are primitive and would fall for whatever flash [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=283.2s)]
*  they were supposed to come with. And this land has added value beneath the snow and ice [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=290.8s)]
*  lie 43 of the 50 minerals and metals deemed by the U S government critical for modern technology. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=297.76s)]
*  They said it bluntly why they are interested in Greenland, like critical mineral resources and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=305.2s)]
*  also trading routes that are emerging due to climate change. So Greenland is smack in the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=310.64s)]
*  middle of it. So it's a very to strategic strategic position for business, but also security. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=316.72s)]
*  It's not just the fishermen who've noticed the ice melting earlier each year. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=324.8s)]
*  Russia and China are also increasing their Arctic presence, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  but only the U S has threatened to take Greenland. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=333.6s)]
*  Seal hunting is a way of life. The boats may be better now, but this is a lifestyle that's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=340.48s)]
*  passed down through the generations. Change is gradual here. A combination of fishing, tourism, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=345.92s)]
*  and a subsidy from the Danish government is what keeps Greenland going as it tries to modernize, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=355.2s)]
*  but retain its traditional culture at the same time. Now Greenlanders say they feel caught. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  They have a complicated relationship with Denmark, the colonial power, and most people I've been [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=368.32s)]
*  speaking to say they see American behavior as threatening. Sunday morning and nothing disturbs [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=374.0s)]
*  the peace in Nuke. When Danish missionaries brought Christianity to Greenland in the 18th century, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=383.12s)]
*  they tried to suppress Inuit culture. These days Greenlanders are free to practice their customs, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=389.76s)]
*  but even though Greenland has self rule, some resentment remains. I was in elementary school. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=396.4s)]
*  We have segregated classes for Danish people and Greenlandic people, so there was segregation [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=403.68s)]
*  still, especially before all of this happened. Nobody in Denmark, basically especially in the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=409.92s)]
*  governments, in the political parties, but also the general sentiment, the majority don't really [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=416.32s)]
*  want to accept they have been a colonial power. But some say in this crisis it's time to forget [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=421.2s)]
*  the old bitterness. I trust Denmark because they have ratified treaties in the UN, like the treaties [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=427.6s)]
*  for indigenous people and preserving our culture. And I trust them also because they have always done [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=436.16s)]
*  right by us when they had to. And whenever we have had problems, whenever we had economical problems [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=443.92s)]
*  Denmark has actually come to our aid. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=450.8s)]
*  This weekend's annual dog sledding championship was partly funded by the US government, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=455.12s)]
*  a classic use of soft power, but President Trump has refused to rule out. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=461.76s)]
*  The machinations were set in motion far before JD Pandan ever came in. That is how the empire [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=467.44s)]
*  operates. That is how the empire operates. Okay. US aid, baby. You got to ease into it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=475.36s)]
*  How else can you dominate the entire planet with, again, 800 military bases? 800 military bases [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=485.68s)]
*  not being considered 800 different military invasions is a testament to the soft power [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=492.16s)]
*  capabilities of American empire. And yet Donald Trump, JD Pandan, JD pond freaking Dom, baby, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=498.24s)]
*  trying to gut that, trying to get that superpower status desperately using hard power. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=505.2s)]
*  The cannons on a Danish warship in New Carb are no longer fire. As a member of NATO, Denmark always [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  thought the US would be part of Greenland's defense while Greenlanders have been aspiring [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=518.8s)]
*  for independence. We haven't been an independent nation, but we're already tasked with dealing [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=524.64s)]
*  with high intensive day to day twists of international policy that we have to say [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=532.0s)]
*  something about. No, it's not time for independence. We don't have the economy for it. And of course, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=539.04s)]
*  we don't have the military for it either. And we never will have a military for that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=544.32s)]
*  Just 57,000 Greenlanders live on a vast snow covered land. The US could have cooperated with [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=551.2s)]
*  Denmark and Greenland to build up its military presence here back to Cold War levels. But [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=558.8s)]
*  Greenland, like Panama and Canada, is part of Donald Trump's plan to dominate the Western [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  hemisphere, whether the people who live here like it or not. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlqYuXuBAJc&t=571.04s)]
