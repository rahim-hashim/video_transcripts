# This Is How I Ended My Trip | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks)
*  Wait, this is my favorite photo of you. What the hell progressive influence would tell [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=0.0s)]
*  us of detention at us airport. There ain't no way Hassan piker picture with playboy bunnies [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=4.46s)]
*  at an event in Washington 2018 says he was interrogated about his political views. That's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=9.02s)]
*  hilarious there. That's a fantastic, fantastic photo. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=12.42s)]
*  Your detention story seriously blew up. Yeah. I don't know what they were thinking. Of course [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=17.66s)]
*  it was going to blow up is you're detaining one of the largest political dissenting voices [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  in North America. That's going to be a problem for a lot of people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=26.54s)]
*  Now there's been a lot of articles written about your boy getting detained by the Department [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=35.42s)]
*  of Homeland Security. So we'll obviously be talking about that a little bit as well. I'm [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=40.84s)]
*  locked up. They won't let me out type shit. Okay. Having said that, having said that, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=44.18s)]
*  there's also a lot of personal news to cover. Hold on. Blast off. This is so stupid. All [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=51.62s)]
*  right. Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls and MBs, we have a lot to talk about in terms [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=59.62s)]
*  of personal news. Let me get right to it. So I ended the broadcast yesterday after a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=63.82s)]
*  wonderful speech delivered at University of Chicago at the Institute of politics. And [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=69.42s)]
*  some of you guys watched it. I hope you guys all enjoyed it. I personally thought it was [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=75.97999999999999s)]
*  great. It was fantastic. I love doing stuff like that. I should probably do more college [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=79.62s)]
*  campus events such as that one. Okay. And I probably will do more college events like [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=83.22000000000001s)]
*  that in the future because I greatly enjoy it and seemingly you guys enjoy it too. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=91.86000000000001s)]
*  So we'll get to all of that. We'll do a recap on that beautiful stuff. But after I was done, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=97.86000000000001s)]
*  I got back in the car with Norma and, and, and of course, had a wonderful journey to O'Hare, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=103.3s)]
*  which was devastating for many different reasons because I did the biggest L of all time. Given [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=109.94s)]
*  my time constraints and given my considerations, given my worries that like, who knows what might [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=116.34s)]
*  happen at the airport again. I went to against my better judgment. As a matter of fact, I went to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  Chicago O'Hare airport hours before my flight, a domestic flight, mind you flight was at 1037 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=128.82000000000002s)]
*  flight was at 1037. I was there by like 7pm, which is so bad. And, and I was just stuck there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  I went to, I went to a lounge, sat my ass down, had to pay for it and sat inside of that goddamn [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=143.62s)]
*  lounge and hoped for time to pass. I also at the airport on my flight, met the, the basketball [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=151.38s)]
*  player from 76ers who's the Philly player. He's really cool. He's like homies with the phase boys. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=161.62s)]
*  I've DMed him in the past. I forget his name now. Jared McCain. Yeah, he's so sick. He's so cool. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=170.34s)]
*  He's such a nice guy. Him and his friends. There was a Hasan Abihed that was walking by [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=177.22s)]
*  as I pointed to him and I said, Hey, you play ball, right? Like your boys with the, with the, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=181.77999999999997s)]
*  with the phase boys. And, and he was, he was like, yeah, that's, that's me. And Hasan Abihed was [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=186.33999999999997s)]
*  walking past us and he pointed to me first. And when I said, you play basketball, he pointed to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  him and he went, Oh my God. And he gave me the phone. You son of a, okay, if you're out there, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=198.89999999999998s)]
*  you were tall as shit too. You son of a, you saw me first. You got excited to see me. And then you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=204.34s)]
*  saw Jared McCain and you gave me the phone to take a photo of you and Jared McCain. And then only [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=209.78s)]
*  after that, you gave the phone to Jared McCain to take a photo of you and I. Okay. That was [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=215.14s)]

*  situation. That's crazy. That's crazy that you humbled me first. You were supposed to humble him [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=233.22s)]
*  so that he's like, damn, who is this guy? He's got motion, right? The fuck? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=239.7s)]
*  God damn it, Hasan Abihed. You can't do that. If you ever see me in public with a person that's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=247.94s)]
*  like way more famous than me, you have to big me up. It's not even an ego thing. It's 5D chest [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=252.98s)]
*  moves. He doesn't know who the fuck I am. But if you do that, he's going to be like, Whoa, who is [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=258.34s)]
*  this guy? You know what I mean? Were you the shortest one out of three? No, I think I'm taller [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=262.1s)]

*  chest move? He goes, who is this guy? I don't know him. Then in his mind, he's thinking, oh, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=283.62s)]
*  if he asked me to do content with him, I'm going to be more interested. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=289.06s)]
*  Think. But yeah, it didn't work out that way anyway. But he was really nice. He was really [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWwTzodapks&t=294.02s)]
