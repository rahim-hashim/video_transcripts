# Reality Or Delusion On TikTok | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8)
*  1.7 million likes bro. 1.7 million likes. This is so nutty. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the same guy who made a video about how he was so upset over the breakup. He said he made a plan to his eggs. Yeah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=8.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't care about like all of the other, um, Tik TOK drama that this guy was associated with. I care about specifically [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=12.8s)]
*  what he's talking about right now. Apparently an incredibly popular narrative on Tik TOK. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=20.0s)]
*  In LA, if you survived the fire, congrats. This is round two. This is threat number two. Threat number one was the fire. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=30.0s)]
*  It's slowing down. Great. Do not relax. There's no time for fucking tears yet. No crying, no nothing. This is game time because human beings are the apex predator. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=38.0s)]
*  People are aware. Cops. Nobody's responding to crimes right now. Everything is going to be covered. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=48.0s)]
*  What? What is going on here? And overlooked by this whole fire that's happening. People are already breaking into businesses, breaking into houses, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=57.0s)]
*  harming other people, unaliving other people because nobody's going to fucking take the time. There's too much happening for people to look at. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=67.0s)]
*  Oh, this person's not breathing no more. Was it a red rum or was it the devastation? There's too many things to be focused on. All crime. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=75.0s)]
*  No one's there to help you right now. So protect you and yours at all costs. And I mean all costs, all that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=86.0s)]
*  Bro, what what is happening in the minds of people on TikTok? It's like it's like wild seeing a dude who's like 30 plus years old saying unaliving and red rum. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=94.0s)]
*  Okay. TikTok language is just like infiltrated the brains of a rot of the brains of so many people. But also this guy is saying this guy has 1.7 million likes on this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=106.0s)]
*  TikTok talking about like how there is a murder and capitalism happening in every corner of Los Angeles right now. And the cops know about it and they're not doing anything to prevent it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=118.0s)]
*  What a what an insane, what an insane statement. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court seems likely to uphold a law that could ban TikTok in the United States of America. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=127.0s)]
*  And when I see stuff like this, I become reactionary myself and say, oh, good, please. It's crazy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=139.0s)]
*  That f**k a pent up bulls**t that everybody got from 2024. You want to crash the f**k out? Save it. You're about to need it. This is not a time to relax. This is not a time to f**king chill out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=145.0s)]
*  This is about to become a fight for resources. And you're also going to be dealing with people in the society of LA. All these homeless people been waiting for their moment. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=155.0s)]
*  This is their time to shine. They're already breaking in to houses, businesses, stealing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=165.0s)]
*  This guy used to be so nice. What happened? Like, I remember this guy having like a like a relatively normal attitude about things and being like kind of like a funny guy. What is going on right now? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=170.0s)]
*  And that's the one you really got to pray to make it the f**k out of. And when I say protect you and yours at all costs, I mean at all costs because their crimes are kind of free for all. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=200.0s)]
*  But if you got to do what you got to do, everybody's kind of free. This is all alleged also because I'm making this video, but everybody there, you know what the f**k is really going on. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=211.0s)]
*  You know what to do. So do not hesitate to do it. And the other thing, women, stick the f**k together. Be as vicious as you have to be. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=221.0s)]
*  Nobody can respond to a crime call right now. Cops can't get down the f**king road to nobody. If men want to... [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=233.0s)]
*  Because I live here. I'm fairly close to some of the fires. What the hell is this guy talking about, bro? The roads are closed and whatnot. What are you? What is happening right now? What are these people saying? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=240.0s)]
*  There's like roving gangs of homeless people that are looking to do unalivings. What is... Dude, dude, this kind of stuff. If you look outside, what do you see? It's just a normal city. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=255.0s)]
*  Dude, dude, like the night of the sunset fire, there was definitely a panicked environment. Understandable. Okay. 100%. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=266.0s)]
*  But the notion that there's like mass f**kers occurring on the streets with cops refusing to respond to calls, like all this stuff. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=276.0s)]
*  What the hell are you talking about? This. Tana Mongeau. This. Why does this sound horribly like the purge in a way? Stop giving them ideas. We were taught this in my emergency management program. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=285.0s)]
*  Defend yourself in the first 72 hours. You're like the big brother who doesn't want to be mean, but definitely these are facts. Why does he make so freaking sense? Whoop ass girls and ladies. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=294.0s)]
*  First, ask no questions later. When he said be as vicious as you can be, babe, I got chills. Bro, what is happening right now? Bro, we dead ass look like 10 minutes away and my mom would believe this bullshit. It ain't just people not from around here. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=304.0s)]
*  No, I know. That's the craziest part. That is the craziest part about mind melting because we spent so much time online that the reality outside of your door is no longer important. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=316.0s)]
*  Okay. What is important is what they're saying online. It ends up literally breaking the brains of people that are directly in the in the impacted area. It is crazy. And I don't know how you deal with that. Like, what do you mean? Look outside, man. I walk my dog this morning. Okay. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=331.0s)]
*  The hell are you talking about? Mass gangs doing mass orders or whatever? Like, what a what a crazy LARP, dude. This is being read as female empowerment. I know American minds are so warped that you can even you can have like a like a supposedly liberal progressive guy talk in the exact same way that like libertarian gun nuts do. Okay. But then couch it under female empowerment and girls will be like, that's right, ladies. Think like them to counter them. It's sad, but some people help. And some people take advantage when disaster strikes because they see opportunities. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=349.0s)]
*  I don't think check and fully comprehend how badly crime panic is broken Californians brains. Yeah, I mean, I've been warning about this for a while. I've been warning about this non stop talking about how like, people have people in California have lost their minds where they think like, he lives in Texas. Then why is he talk? This is insane, dude. Actually insane. It's insane. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=376.0s)]
*  What you gonna do? There's no one to call. There's no one to help. So when I say life or death, and it's your life or your death. So act accordingly. This is not over. And there's no time to cry yet. Not yet. I am 1.7 million likes bro 1.7 million likes. This is so nutty. This is the same guy who made a video about how men are being overpowered. I'm not going to say that. I'm just saying that. I'm not going to say that. I'm just saying that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=396.0s)]
*  I'm not going to say that. I'm [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=426.0s)]
*  going to say that in the next video. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=429.04s)]
*  hotel Rwanda. Yeah. A complete societal collapse has taken place in, in Los Angeles. Okay. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=455.6s)]
*  Do not look outside. I'm literally doing door dash in Pasadena right now. I don't know what [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=461.94s)]
*  the fuck he's talking about. People like this wanted to be real so bad. They've been waiting [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=466.22s)]
*  for an apocalypse. Yeah. Like that's, that's the craziest thing. Like yo, the municipality [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=470.3s)]
*  picked up trash yesterday. Okay. What are you guys talking about? Like what are you [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=477.38s)]
*  talking about? I just don't understand what like, how do you, how do you fantasize about [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=482.82s)]
*  like islands taking place somewhere else? I'm there. Okay. I'm in the neighborhood. I'm [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=488.26s)]
*  going to tell you right now. These people are out of their minds. All right. He sounds [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=493.26s)]
*  like he's 30 people. What happens when a guy comes to your house or hurt you overpowering? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=497.26s)]
*  No one call for help is me. I'm the guy. No, I'm just, you were worried about that trash [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=500.46000000000004s)]
*  pick up. No, I'm just using that as an example, as a point of reference to showcase that like [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=503.66s)]
*  one Los Angeles is massive. And two, like, obviously certain parts of the areas that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=507.82s)]
*  are not impacted by the wildfires immediately are still operating in the normal ways that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=516.54s)]
*  they are operating. That's it. Probably Kai ate two looters today and you're covering [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=521.1s)]
*  up this narrative. Yeah. So a mansion can burn and that is good. What are you talking [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4HVgkXva8&t=524.98s)]
