# Asmongold Fell Through His Ceiling | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI)
*  I don't think it's cosplay. I don't, we need a different term for it. This is what it is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not like he's living in a ginormous mansion and he's like carefully designed certain areas [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=4.0s)]
*  of the mansion that look like it's a, it's a dark souls mission. Did you see Asmine falling [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=10.32s)]
*  through his addict searching for dead animals? Did he fall through his addict? I, did I [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=20.32s)]
*  misunderstand his point? Cause yes, I did see it and I already, I quote retweeted it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=25.84s)]
*  Here he said took the day off to find some dead animal in my attic that smelled bad. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=34.24s)]
*  Oh wait, he fell through. Did he fall through the dead animal fall through the attic? Oh, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=38.24s)]
*  I didn't even realize I said, this is an impressive display of rot coming from the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=44.56s)]
*  most successful right-wing commentator in North America, bro. How dude, the structural integrity [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=47.6s)]
*  of that addict was basically non-existent. If someone who is as way fish, like as it goes, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=55.92s)]
*  like a twig, how the did he have enough weight to even go through tofu drag? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, dude, as I'm going to go, I was living in as my goals living in tofu walls, dude, what the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=70.64s)]
*  need to investigate the girl, rot subculture is a change of pace. No, no, no. He stepped on the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=78.56s)]
*  ceiling. You're supposed to walk on the two by fours. Oh, he just straight up walked on the dry [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=83.76s)]
*  wall and he just fell through. Even then, even then I feel like it shouldn't, it's still like [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=89.76s)]
*  hold them up. He's not that heavy. I read braces comment. If he stepped between the rafter sheet [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=96.56s)]
*  rock is not strong. Not everybody has $2 billion laying around to just buy another belly. Yeah, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  you're right. Except as mingled is in exceptionally wealthier than me. So he's the one guy. You can't [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=107.28s)]
*  say that about also additionally funny considering that. Do you guys live like this? You don't make [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=115.44s)]
*  any money in comparison to as mingled. Do you live in these circumstances? No. So like, this is unique. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=123.76s)]
*  This is exceptional. This is truly, truly horrifying, horrifyingly repulsive. It's not like [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=133.28s)]
*  he also lives in like a, like a high value real estate market either. He lives in Austin, Texas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't, I just, I can't get over this, man. This is such as like, it's such a choice to post this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=147.44s)]
*  as well. And it leads me to believe that his audience actually loves this. Like his audience [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=156.0s)]
*  loves this. I think the more rotten everything is in his life, the more they're like, yeah, he's a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=162.32s)]
*  real one. You know how like I used to talk about in the back, back in the day, I used to talk about [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=168.32s)]
*  how people would say, like the only way to measure the authenticity of a, of an internet content [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=174.16s)]
*  creator was like how edgy and how racist they would get. Like a lot of young teenagers and whatnot [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=181.92s)]
*  would measure someone's realness by how racist they would get, how much racism they would entertain. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  Now I feel like it's not just racism. It also has to be, it, it, it also has to be rot living in rot. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=195.92s)]
*  Like the more you live in rot, the more your, your conditions resemble squalor, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=205.52s)]
*  the more real and the more authentic you are respect rot maxing. Imagine being so rich, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  you can cosplay like this and think it's rational living in filled, bro. It's not even, is it [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=217.44s)]
*  cosplay? I don't think it's cosplay. I don't, we need a different term for it. This is what it is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  It's not like he's living in a ginormous mansion and he's like carefully designed certain areas [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  of the mansion to look like it's a, it's a dark souls mission. No, like I'll give you an example. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=232.24s)]
*  What I have done in my life has not changed from being broke to being as financially secure as I [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=238.0s)]
*  am now. I haven't changed my daily regimen as you guys are. I was streaming eight hours a day when [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=245.68s)]
*  I was broke. I stream eight hours a day when I'm not broke. Right. So in that regard, I didn't [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=252.24s)]
*  necessarily change too much in my life, but I did improve my living conditions because I'm a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=258.24s)]
*  normal person who's like, yeah, I want to, I want to have a big house where I can host my family, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=264.64s)]
*  you know, and my friends and, and not live in rot. He didn't do the second part. Eight hours [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=270.32s)]
*  streams Lamau. Are we really doing this? We're really acting like I do half days now because [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=277.2s)]
*  sometimes I end at seven hours and 30 minutes. So who is more real? I guess he's more real. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=281.92s)]
*  He doesn't give a shit about anything. As man is partly slash largely a low count even to his [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=287.68s)]
*  audience who like him. Yeah. I don't really know. I don't really understand. I truly don't get it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=292.24s)]
*  What the is this? I am, I ain't never represent, baby. I do no wrong. I could clean up good for [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=298.56s)]
*  you. Oh, I know. I know right from wrong. Cause I want to make it so badly. What is this? Why are [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=304.8s)]
*  you sending me a central V's tweet, dude? Oh yeah. I'm docking your pay from what you, the, the, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=311.92s)]
*  what you're paying for in the thousands of hours of stream content that you get for free. If you [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=320.8s)]
*  have a Twitch prime, by the way, no, he doesn't drive the 99 Mustang anymore. Cause it, it [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=325.92s)]
*  literally broke down when I was in Texas doing his podcast and I believe he got a new car. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=331.12s)]
*  Yeah. The price point comes out to like five cents, five cents an hour. Yes. I did his podcast, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=338.56s)]
*  dude. I mean, this is before he went full blown. The new face of the online, right? Oh yeah. I saw [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=345.12s)]
*  Michael from Pennsylvania post this or is the audio. Yeah. Drama alert went from saying he's so [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=350.0s)]
*  gross to, to loving every loving every moment. I paid Amazon for like three years, subbing and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=354.88s)]
*  I've only ordered packages like twice. Ain't nobody asked you to get Amazon prime so you can [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=360.72s)]
*  get a Twitch prime. I always tell you, you can use your mom's Amazon prime account and connect it [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=367.2s)]
*  to your Twitch account. You can do that to get one free prime subscription a month. Use it on your [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  favorite broadcast, a broadcaster. Hopefully it's me, Hassan Hassan, I'll be piker. That's right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=377.52s)]
*  At the top of the hour, there's a three minute break, except no longer do I serve the three [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=381.76s)]
*  minute outbreak, but you can still subscribe this community or voluntary contributions like PBS, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=385.12s)]
*  except just like PBS, I don't have a national funding any longer, which is what Trump is [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=390.72s)]
*  entertaining. He is entertaining to, I mean, he is, he's, he's considering taking away. He is [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=398.56s)]
*  considering taking away the, the grants that the federal government gives to PBS and NPR. So now [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=406.32s)]
*  they have to play on my level. What is broke to you though? I thought you admitted to being a [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=413.44s)]
*  Neville baby just yesterday. Not trying to attack at all. Genuinely asking. Yeah. What is broke to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=417.68s)]
*  me is making $20,000 a year, brother. What the fuck in Los Angeles and living in the fucking [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=423.76s)]
*  kitchen of a frat house. I was definitely, no, I am, I am a Neville baby in terms of like [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  my, my nepotism, my nepotism allowed me to get a job at my uncle's startup YouTube channel. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=438.56s)]
*  This is correct. Which gave me a massive leg up in terms of being in the digital media space. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=448.4s)]
*  But having said that there was definitely a long period of time where I was not financially secure. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  I grew up affluent as well on top of that, but that affluence went away by the time I got the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=462.56s)]
*  college. Cause my father lost all of his money, basically gambling in the stock market. Okay. I [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=468.8s)]
*  was just wondering, I'm not trying to say you never were broke or didn't work to get to where you are. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=474.72s)]
*  I mean, I work, but you know, luck also plays a big role in this. And I do have that privilege. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg_grUZBzI&t=479.04s)]
