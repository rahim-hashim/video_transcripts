# Hasan Interviews Dekarldent About The Rise Of Far-Right Extremism In Germany
**HasanAbi:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA)
*  And now pretty like even the Green Party, which is like the one of the more left wing parties, you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=0.0s)]
*  could say it's like a they're they're neoliberal, but they also like left wing, like at least they [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=7.36s)]
*  were in the last couple of years, and they turned straight to the right wing policies. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=14.72s)]
*  He's like, but it'll be all right. All right. We are now going to talk about the German [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=18.4s)]
*  elections. Okay. I have, I have a German streamer who's also going to be talking to us about who's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=28.88s)]
*  going to give us some direct info. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Can you [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=41.36s)]
*  hear me? Yes. This is the German. You wanted the German. Now there's a, yeah. What would you, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  what would you like for me to call you by the way? Or how would you, how would you introduce yourself [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  to my audience? Just call me Carl. Okay. All right, Carl. Hold on. Let me boom. Let me turn this off. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  Do you want a German accent or not? I, I can give you the full German experience if you want to. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=71.92s)]
*  I mean, you, I like that you're, you're making it seem you're implying that you don't have a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=79.68s)]
*  German accent right now. I do. I do. I do. I do. But I can, I can make it much stronger. Okay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=84.16s)]
*  No, this is good. This is a good level of, of German. I think. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=89.92s)]
*  Have you ever heard, have you ever heard my German accent? Carl? No. Yeah, I did. I did. I [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=95.28s)]
*  like your Turkish one better, but the German one is not bad. Oh, when I say like, oh my, oh my God, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=100.08s)]
*  you got to work on your anger level because if you want to imitate a German one, then you've got to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=109.28s)]
*  be much more angry. This was more like an Austrian accent. Ah, okay. The German one is like a much [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=113.2s)]
*  harder one. Like, Oh my God, I can't believe it. Oh my God, I can't believe it. That's much better. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=121.28s)]
*  More angry. Just, just imagine you hate foreigners and there's a bunch of them in your country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=131.12s)]
*  And then, and then that's the anger level you want to have. I mean, that's not, that's not very, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=136.4s)]
*  that's not very hard to imagine how, you know, that people behave in that situation considering that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=140.32s)]
*  I have been a long time Warner, I guess, not an advocate, but I've been, I've been warning about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  the fascist movement and mobilization happening in Europe and European countries, Germany included [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  for quite a while. And I think that there is a lot that is happening in the United States of America [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=160.48s)]
*  that ends up happening in Germany as well. Now, of course, I want to talk to you about that today, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  considering that there was obviously a German election that took place and Germany's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=172.32s)]
*  conservatives celebrated the election as the far right was carved out of the governing coalition, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=178.56s)]
*  even though they had major, major victories. And I want to, I want to talk about that. I want to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  talk about the link, but if you don't mind, let's get started on the parties in general. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=193.76s)]
*  Like what are, what are some of the German parties? How does that look? And also maybe we can do like [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=201.92s)]
*  a, like a briefer on every single, every individual party and the election results as well. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So, so it's a bit, it's a bit more complicated in Germany than it is in America. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=215.04s)]
*  In America, you got two neoliberal parties. Yeah. In Germany, we got like 20 of them. So [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=219.6s)]
*  we got a lot more neoliberal parties to choose from. And there's like one non-neoliberal party, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=226.24s)]
*  which is like just kinda neoliberal. So this is a classical left-wing party with some Marxist [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=232.72000000000003s)]
*  ideologies in there. And pretty much all the rest of them, like despite the color, despite the name, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  like even the social democratic party is like neoliberal right-wing, if you ask me. So we got [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  a lot to choose from and not much to pick for. Yeah. So to start at the top, which is like the, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=251.44s)]
*  the party that won the election, which is like a Christian democratic party or it's a center-right [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=258.64s)]
*  party, right? It's a center-right party. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Like they call themselves a center-right [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=264.64s)]
*  party, but Friedrich Merz, which will be the next chancellor of Germany. He's pretty much a light [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=270.32s)]
*  version of Donald Trump. So he worked for BlackRock for 10 years. He's a multi-millionaire. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=276.8s)]
*  He tried to take over the party a couple of times in the past, but failed. Then Angela Merkel, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  after 16 years of being the chancellor, left the party or stepped back from the party and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=288.72s)]
*  Friedrich Merz took over. So it's pretty much, he's pretty much a light fascist who doesn't [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=296.32s)]
*  show himself as much as he could, but he's far from being middle right or center right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=303.76s)]
*  Yeah. He's just right-wing. So the question I have for you, or I guess like the reason why I say that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=311.44s)]
*  is because like initially the integration programs that were put forth and like the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=317.2s)]
*  refugee acceptance that happened was directly, I mean, that was like Merkel and the Christian [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  Democrats were blamed for that. And then they started assuming even a more right-wing position, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=336.56s)]
*  which by the way, yes, I understand like taking advantage of refugees to build your infrastructure. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  I feel like is also a historically right-wing position in general, but now it's attributed to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=348.08s)]
*  the left, even though there's understandable reason for why your country would open your [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=354.24s)]
*  borders into destabilized people that have lost their homes. Yeah. So the five-point plan is [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=358.96s)]
*  basically it's everything they aim for the last couple of years, and now they want to make [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=367.44s)]
*  prisons at the German border. That's pretty much what they're trying to do. We do have a policy [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=373.2s)]
*  in place that'll take the prisons on the European border, but the right-wing parties in Germany [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=379.68s)]
*  want to have those prisons at the German border. So it's pretty much just like a worst version [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=385.36s)]
*  of the European policy. Yeah. It seems like, but that's what I mean. Like they saw the rise of the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  AFD and other, you know, they saw a lot of right-wing mobilization and they basically turned around and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=402.08s)]
*  were like, no, no, no, we're going to be the ones who will oversee the, the militant border policies, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=408.56s)]
*  not these fascists. And I feel like a similar thing also happened with Macron in France as well, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=415.92s)]
*  where with the rise of the nationalist movement in France, Macron oversaw many of the same like [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=422.48s)]
*  anti-migrant policies and adopted them almost entirely and pushed for it aggressively. And if [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=428.72s)]
*  you ask these guys, they will say, Oh, we're doing this because we want to stop fascism. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=434.96s)]
*  We're capitulating to reactionary sentiment so that we can stop the fascists from gaining power [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  and gaining momentum. That is precisely what the democratic party tried doing as well. But of course, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=448.4s)]
*  they got destroyed by the Republicans in the process and they've never really stopped trying [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  to do that anyway. Well, that's what they always do. Right? Like as soon as the economy fails [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=457.28s)]
*  because of capitalism, they turn fascist and they try to take all the blame and put them on [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=461.6s)]
*  the foreigners in Germany. And they did the same in Italy, they did the same in France, in Poland, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  Hungary, they did it in all the European countries, which is why all of Europe moves to the right wing. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=473.36s)]
*  And now pretty like even the Green Party, which is like the one of the more left wing parties, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=478.72s)]
*  you could say it's like they're neoliberal, but they're also like left wing, like at least they [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=485.84s)]
*  were in the last couple of years and they turned straight to the right wing policies against [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=493.35999999999996s)]
*  foreigners. And pretty much like they're in line with the AFD, which is what's happening right now. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=497.28s)]
*  So we got a couple of parties like five of them who are just in line with AFD. They do the same [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=504.88s)]
*  policies. They're pretty much the same except for being not as much anti-Europe as the AFD is. So [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=510.16s)]
*  the AFD wants like a German currency. They want the Deutsche Mark back, which is like catastrophic, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=516.24s)]
*  which is like the only thing that the AFD does that the other parties don't do. So in Germany, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=522.0s)]
*  we're pretty much as a left winger in Germany, you're pretty much fucked at best. Oh no, I know. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=526.64s)]
*  Oh, I see it. And I think like the Israel stuff, I think perfectly demonstrated that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=533.28s)]
*  like in terms of German politics and the, and the widespread adoption of like very far right [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=540.56s)]
*  sentiment on this issue. But the thing that is always shocking to me is when the German government, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=547.04s)]
*  for example, will undermine the ICC or when the German government will, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=553.52s)]
*  when anyone in the, you know, when any German politician says like, oh, you know, fuck the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=560.8s)]
*  European Union, like the European Union is geared by Germany. If Germany falls, then the EU is gone. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=566.88s)]
*  There's no more EU. Like it's the economic engine. And the same with ICC. Sorry, go ahead. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=574.48s)]
*  European politics is German politics. It's not in Brussels, it's in Paris and France. That's [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=581.68s)]
*  pretty much it. And as you said with all the Palestinian and Israel stuff, like if I be in [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=588.96s)]
*  Germany, like I live in Ireland, but if I be in Germany, I'd be in jail. Like pretty much [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=595.6s)]
*  that's just straight up it. Like we're like the left movement in Germany is just as pro Israel as [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=600.64s)]
*  as like the American right wing movement. Like as a, as a pro Palestinian left winger, you're pretty [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=608.72s)]
*  much just fucked all over the place. I mean, I got a tattoo on my arm that says, Palestinian. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  If I, if I'd had that in Germany, like I'd be in jail. That's pretty much saying, I mean, I've seen [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=620.64s)]
*  it though. I've seen it there. They're barely actively going after any kind of like mobilization [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=627.6s)]
*  that, that criticizes Israel. And, and even from what I understand, D link is what we're going to [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=634.4s)]
*  be talking about today. Obviously they got, they gained a lot in this election and there's, there's, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=640.16s)]
*  you know, there's some celebration that's worthy here. I think, especially as an American, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=647.36s)]
*  it's like ridiculous for me to, to criticize any other countries, politics in this, in this way, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  because like the link, even if I don't fully align with their, with their worldview, it's like closer [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=656.4s)]
*  to me than the, than the modern democratic party is that's for sure. So in that, in that regard, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=661.84s)]
*  I think there's, there's some, there's some celebration that's that, that must be had here. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=670.16s)]
*  Having said that you can't have a conversation about the link as a massive gains without thinking [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=675.52s)]
*  about the, the shadow cast by the AFTs, unimaginable gains in such a short period of time [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=682.4s)]
*  becoming the second largest block. Now, of course they're going to be, and you can describe this a [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=690.64s)]
*  little bit better for my audience. I hope there's going to be some, there there's, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=696.8s)]
*  it, they're not going to be a part of the governing coalition. The AFD is not going to be a part of [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=705.92s)]
*  the governing coalition. So even though they are effectively a second largest party, they're still [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=710.96s)]
*  completely shut out from the government. So, so that's, you know, that's, that's praiseworthy, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=714.8s)]
*  I guess, or that's what the, that's the reason why the right wing is celebrating in Germany. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=720.56s)]
*  No, yes and no, yes and no, because, because they're being used as a tool by the Christian [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=726.48s)]
*  democratic union. So basically you have to understand that for whatever reason, although [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=730.56s)]
*  we're turning back to being Nazis, like we have a problem with being called the Nazis. So the, the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=734.96s)]
*  policies are the same and the thinking is the same. We're as much racist as we were in the forties, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=741.44s)]
*  but we have a big problem with being called racist and Nazis. And so we, we tried to do right [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=746.72s)]
*  wing policies and politics, but without being called Nazis. So the Christian democratic union [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=753.12s)]
*  is using the AFD as a tool. Pretty much they're, they're saying we have to work with the SPD. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=760.32s)]
*  And if you're not doing as we please, then we're going to work together with AFD. That's what [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  they're doing. They, they try, usually we have like a, we have four years of a government working [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=772.0s)]
*  together and the, the Christian democratic union already says we're doing this for one year. So [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=776.88s)]
*  we're just restricting the time for one year and we see how it goes. And if you're not doing what [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=782.48s)]
*  we want to, we work with the, with the Nazis. This is what's happening. So they got big power. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=788.08s)]
*  They got, they got a huge, they got a huge momentum. And as a left-winger in Germany, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=793.44s)]
*  pretty much our job is to, to like, to use the people that are, that are beginning to think [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=799.2800000000001s)]
*  as a left-winger, which are not many, but at least a couple of them. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=809.12s)]
*  So let's talk about the previous coalition. There was a three-party coalition that existed. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=813.68s)]
*  And it was always a, from what I understand, it always was seemingly struggling. And now CDU in [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=819.36s)]
*  this, in this instance is able to gain more momentum. Can you talk about the previous [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=827.68s)]
*  coalition? They weren't struggling. Like that's what they're saying. And then people are excusing [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=831.2s)]
*  for them being struggling, but the government didn't struggle. And also the, the, the coalition [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=835.52s)]
*  didn't struggle, but the world was struggling. So we had Corona and we had the Ukraine war. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=840.96s)]
*  And this was pretty much a major factor for our economy. And that's the reason why the government [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=846.64s)]
*  didn't do as well as they could have done without all those crisis. And they did more like, I think [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=852.64s)]
*  they did like 70% of what they were, what they promised to do, which is more than any other [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=858.88s)]
*  government in the, in the history of Germany did. So they did, they pretty much did a great job, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=864.0s)]
*  although they didn't do what I wanted them to do, but on the, that's a whole nother level, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=868.72s)]
*  but they did as they, as they promised. And they did a lot better than, than any other [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=872.08s)]
*  German government in the past, but the right-wing movement, so Christian democratic union and AFD, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=876.5600000000001s)]
*  they took all the economic crisis and said, well, that's cause of the government. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=882.72s)]
*  And people took the pill. So what are you going to do? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=886.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, for Western liberal capitalist countries, this was obviously the incumbent [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=889.12s)]
*  disadvantage election globally. And it, that's the reason why it was partially the reason why [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=896.96s)]
*  even the Tories lost in the UK. So whoever was in charge that oversaw the cost of living crisis was, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=902.96s)]
*  was basically left with all of the blame. And I think that the right-wing obviously took advantage [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=911.76s)]
*  of that. Having said that, I think that their solutions ultimately are not going to call, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=917.44s)]
*  are not going to solve any of the problems that exist and only make things worse overall. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=924.0s)]
*  Well, and there's another fact that you have to take into consideration because the FTP was [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=930.64s)]
*  basically just openly sabotaging the government the last, the last three years. So they said it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=934.88s)]
*  So usually the, the government works for four years. This time there was, there were new elections [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=941.44s)]
*  after just three years because the FTP was like basically just sabotaging, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=947.2s)]
*  sabotaging the government and they had no chance but to do reelections. Right. So, yeah. Well, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=952.16s)]
*  well, at least they're not in the government as of now. So they didn't get enough votes, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=960.88s)]
*  which is good. But this was a major factor for the, for the last government not being as successful [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=965.36s)]
*  as they could have been. So the way that the way this works is if you don't get 50% majority, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=972.48s)]
*  like if no singular party gets a reaches 50% majority, then they have to set up a coalition. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=978.8000000000001s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And it seems like the, the Christian Democrats are going to set up a coalition with [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=983.6s)]
*  the SPD once again, as they have in the past. And therefore, I mean, that's that, that I suspect is [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=988.5600000000001s)]
*  what's, what's going to take place. Right. Like that's the, it's not, it's not as much about [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=998.96s)]
*  percentages as it is about seats. So a couple of seats, like I think it's 316 as of now that you [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1004.88s)]
*  need to form a government. So, or, or in a six, I don't know, but, but at, at this place, we're [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1011.52s)]
*  going to get the Christian Democratic union and SPD government, which is basically a given. Yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1018.08s)]
*  316 seats, 316 seats total. Right. So that is a given. Yeah. What do you, I mean, what, what are, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1023.44s)]
*  what have they signaled that these two parties are going to do? Cause like SPD, can you, can you [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1034.4s)]
*  describe to my American audience, like what SPD is and, and how they present themselves versus [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1039.68s)]
*  like what their current alignment is, what their current ideological alignment is? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1046.16s)]
*  I think in Germany, they call them the socialists. So in Germany, like in America, everything that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1050.88s)]
*  is like just slightly left wing is a socialist. So they're, they're far from being socialist. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1056.4s)]
*  Like they're, they're like a neoliberal, just centric party that does everything they have to [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1061.68s)]
*  do to stay in power, to take the power. And they doing, they doing nothing that is, that [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1067.76s)]
*  could be considered left wing for 20 to 25 years. So they destroyed the social state. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1074.3200000000002s)]
*  They present themselves as a labor party, which is kind of the whole identity of being like a labor [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1081.04s)]
*  party, just like doing, doing the stuff that the others wouldn't do being like a classical Marxist [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1087.28s)]
*  left wing party. But they like ever since the, the KPD, so the communist party in Germany, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1093.1200000000001s)]
*  split themselves from the SPD. There's not much of a socialist view left in the, in the SPD. So [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1100.3200000000002s)]
*  the difference between SPD and CDU isn't as large as you'd think. So they pretty much do the same [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1107.92s)]
*  Eurocentric neoliberal politics and they're great coalition partners. Like they work together for [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1116.88s)]
*  like 20 years, the last couple of years, I'm 36 years of age and I can't imagine like, like SPD [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1124.56s)]
*  and CDU, it's basically the government. They're, they're, they're doing coalitions all the time [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1130.8799999999999s)]
*  for 20 years and they're doing, they're doing much the same. CDU says what has to be done. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1136.24s)]
*  And SPD just like, they do nothing. So pretty much like, let me ask you something, Carl, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1142.1599999999999s)]
*  there are a lot of, I would say German liberals who are frustrated with your commentary and it's [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1150.08s)]
*  something that I'm very familiar with. Liberals being frustrated with the commentary. What, what [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1155.6s)]
*  do you, what is their assessment? And I asked chat this as well. What do you, what is your assessment [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1161.6s)]
*  chat? The German liberals specifically, like, what is your, what is your problem with what Carl has [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1166.08s)]
*  said so far? Cause it seems like maybe, I mean, I've seen a lot of people that support the greens [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1170.8s)]
*  saying that the greens are actually leftist. I've seen a lot of people chime in and say the SPD is [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1177.52s)]
*  not neoliberal. But I mean, just crazy, but okay. It seems like from what my assessment, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1182.56s)]
*  and this is reductive, but I saw basically the, the Christian Democrats and SPD and even the greens [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1191.6000000000001s)]
*  as like numerous, like different parts of the democratic party, even the FTP, as a matter of [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1200.0s)]
*  fact, very similar to the American democratic party, but they just all have like different facets [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1205.6s)]
*  of the American democratic party. Cause we have our crazy neoliberals who like immediately want [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1213.84s)]
*  to implement, you know, free market principles on the one hand, we have our obviously relatively [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1219.36s)]
*  socially conservative, right wing Democrats out there, the blue dog Democrats and, and the [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1227.52s)]
*  problem solvers caucus here in America. So like, I think the, all of these parties that I have [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1232.96s)]
*  basically pointed to make up different parts of the democratic party. And I would even go so far [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1238.08s)]
*  say the link as well would make up like the super progressive wing of the democratic party, like the [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1244.48s)]
*  AOCs and the Bernie Sanders is of the Dems as well. I wouldn't say so. Cause I heard, I heard a great [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1249.52s)]
*  think in Germany who says if you, if you take all the policies that the link tries to implement [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1256.88s)]
*  and you just implement 50% of them, that's the end of capitalism. Like, and it's pretty much [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1262.64s)]
*  just the truth. So they're, they're very, like, they have some great Marxist thinkers in, in the [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1268.5600000000002s)]
*  lead as of now for the last couple of months and they're doing great work. So I'd say if you, if [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1274.48s)]
*  you want to vote for a left wing party, then you have to vote for the linker. The only reason like [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1280.5600000000002s)]
*  the communists in Germany and also those like ultra left-wing people in Germany aren't much of [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1286.48s)]
*  fan of the link is cause they're against parliamentism itself against the democracy as it [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1294.56s)]
*  is. And cause of their statements or missing statements about the genocide in, in Israel and [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1300.32s)]
*  in post senior. So that's, that's the only two reasons that I can think of that people aren't [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  happy with the linker, but besides that, they're doing great work and all those other parties, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1311.76s)]
*  they're, they're pretty much neoliberal. So none of them is socialist. None of them, like some are [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1316.64s)]
*  like more progressive than the others when it comes to society. So SPD and Grüne and FTP, they're all [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1322.16s)]
*  for like homosexual rights and trans rights and stuff like that, but not as much as the linker. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1329.2s)]
*  So even when it comes to the society, the link is much more progressive than all those other parties. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1335.2s)]
*  And when it comes to like economics, like all of them are pretty much doing the same work, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1340.88s)]
*  like all of them are neoliberal. Okay. So D link it from what I understand has both, you know, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1345.44s)]
*  some pro Palestinian sentiment that they've expressed, but also not enough. And, and, and a [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  lot of people that, you know, a lot of people are complaining in the chat that they've like actively [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1360.96s)]
*  worked against some of the pro Palestinians in their ranks as well. They did. They did. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1366.88s)]
*  They threw out a couple of activists out of the party because like, I don't, I don't, I don't [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1373.44s)]
*  understand Germans when it comes to, to Palestinian anyway. So like, it's hard for me to talk about it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1379.2s)]
*  Like a friend of mine, Abdul Shahin, who's like a Palestinian, he said the, the, like the time when [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1384.64s)]
*  I listen to white people about Palestinian is, is over. Like I don't listen to them anymore. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1392.72s)]
*  Like, don't talk to me about the topic. You have no idea whatsoever and you'll never have. So just [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1398.48s)]
*  shut the fuck up and like, let's, let's keep going. Right. And this is pretty much my view on the [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1404.0s)]
*  whole, like Palestinian, like Friedrich Maersk, the first thing he did was invite Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1410.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's, that's pretty much tells the story. Right. So that actually, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1415.44s)]
*  that tells a really scary story because the ICC, much like many European institutions [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1421.2s)]
*  is almost entirely protected by Germany, Germany. And if it wasn't for Germany, then like the ICC is, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1428.8s)]
*  is a completely toothless institution. One could say that it already is unless they're, you know, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1435.68s)]
*  unless they're, they're going after warlords in Africa, or as Lindsey Graham once famously said, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1442.08s)]
*  thugs like Putin with that, with the exception of those territories that the ICC covers, like [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1448.32s)]
*  Germany is supposed to be the, the protective party over the ICC. So when, when Germany invites [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1455.52s)]
*  Netanyahu, that is directly undermining the ICC power is saying that the ICC is over. There is [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1465.4399999999998s)]
*  nothing. Yeah. It's, it's anarchy. Like, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1472.32s)]
*  objectively bad though. Come on. Yes, I know. I'm just simply stating that so is, so was Benjamin [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1475.52s)]
*  Netanyahu. It would be ridiculous if he said, Putin can come to Germany. Okay. Without fear of [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1481.28s)]
*  repercussions, everyone would understandably get mad at him. But when he says Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1488.08s)]
*  can violate the ICC arrest warrant, without any fears, this is not seen as like a, like a direct [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1493.6s)]
*  shot at the, the, the remaining power and influence that this international criminal court has. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1500.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a kick in the balls for, for like, for like the ICC as a whole. Like Germany was [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1508.24s)]
*  that, that, that, that one European country that, that took the ICC and put it about everything else. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1513.68s)]
*  And historically, it's, it's a pretty bad hit for the ICC in general, because it says you can do [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1522.8s)]
*  whatever the fuck you want to as long as you're in line with America. That's pretty much what, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1529.04s)]
*  what that says. And we have no party except for the Linke who, who stood up and said, no, that's [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1533.52s)]
*  not going to happen. Cause Jan van Arcken, who's like the, the head of the Linke or one of the two [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1540.72s)]
*  heads of the Linke, he says like, he's going to be, he's, he's going to go to jail if he tries. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1546.56s)]
*  Yeah, this is, I mean, this is completely unacceptable. Like I just, I don't think [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1552.96s)]
*  people understand how serious this is. Like this is why I kept repeating over and over again. And [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1558.08s)]
*  many Germans in my chat and many Europeans in my chat get mad at me, but like every country is now [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1564.72s)]
*  becoming Victor Orban. A lot of the Western European nations made fun of Victor Orban for [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1570.24s)]
*  understandable reasons for the longest time. And now slowly, but surely they are moving in the [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1574.8799999999999s)]
*  Victor Orban direction. Maybe they're not linking up with Vladimir Putin directly, but these kinds [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1579.52s)]
*  of actions are also beneficial for Putin as well. When you undermine the ICC's authority, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1585.52s)]
*  you're basically saying, yeah, there is no international justice. There is no international [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1591.2s)]
*  court. There's no international law because Germany is the protectorate of the ICC, the entire [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1596.48s)]
*  like post-World War II, whether you want to say it's like an aesthetic development or not, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1602.56s)]
*  the entire rebuilding of the nation revolves around like holding onto these values, right? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1608.48s)]
*  Well, Germany is Europe. That's just pretty much what it is. Like if you talk about the European [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1615.28s)]
*  Union or Europe as a whole, you talk about Germany and France. That's pretty much it. So if you [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1620.8799999999999s)]
*  underline the ICC and you do not arrest Benjamin Netanyahu, all your words from the past have no [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1628.32s)]
*  meaning whatsoever because like Victor Orban, he invited Putin and we exploded, like German [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1635.28s)]
*  media exploded. We're like, you can't do that. That's like an ICC warrant and you can't talk to [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1642.72s)]
*  him. You can't invite him to your country. Now we're pretty much doing basically the same with [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1648.32s)]
*  Netanyahu and no one says anything, which is crazy to me, but go deal with it. That's Germany. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1652.48s)]
*  So let's talk about D-Link as a victory specifically reaching 9% almost with 4.3 million [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1660.72s)]
*  votes. They got 64 seats. They were the most popular party under 18. They were the most [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1672.8799999999999s)]
*  popular party between 18 and 24 with the second most popular party. If I'm not mistaken being [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1678.3999999999999s)]
*  AFT still, but I might be wrong about that. And that's still obviously, I mean, that's, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1682.96s)]
*  that's a good thing overall. What do you attribute to D-Link as victories in this, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1690.08s)]
*  in this last election? Well, it was the focus. They like, they, they focus on class war. So [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1696.8s)]
*  it was, it was the first time in years, like I can't imagine a time where like a left-wing [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1703.6s)]
*  party in Germany, it's such a good, amazing focus on class war. They were talking about [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1709.04s)]
*  workers, right? They were talking about rents. They were talking about like food and beverage [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1714.88s)]
*  prices. It was basically just all economics was like, like you, you struggle and we have problems [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1720.72s)]
*  and those problems are the money. You're missing money. We're going to get you the money and we [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1728.0800000000002s)]
*  could get you the money from the rich people. That was basically everything they did. And [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  like a strict anti-fascist polity. And that's the reason why they, they got almost 9%, which is great. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1739.04s)]
*  Yeah. So I, I am a firm and committed believer that austerity is what has made Europe more [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1747.76s)]
*  reactionary. Austerity implemented by neoliberal parties, the undermining of social safety nets, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1756.56s)]
*  and also the privatization of the already undermined social safety nets that make these [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1762.8s)]
*  services that were previously controlled by the government worse and worse overall. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1767.52s)]
*  And in that anger and resentment, you create an environment that is perfectly captured by [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1772.32s)]
*  right-wing reactionary movements, blaming migrants, blaming gay people, engaging in culture wars and [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1778.6399999999999s)]
*  the like. So seeing a party actively combat that, and then try to bring the conversation back to [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1783.76s)]
*  how the government can help you, especially when you have like some semblance of social safety [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1791.36s)]
*  nets and a defense of said things is ultimately a good thing. But it's clear that- [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1796.08s)]
*  Well, compared to America, we have a great social security system. Like compared to America, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1800.96s)]
*  like Germany is great. Like we're not as good as Scandinavian countries are, but we are a lot better [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1804.96s)]
*  than the US is doing. But we could do a lot better. So we're privatizing like the whole, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1809.76s)]
*  like we're not buying houses, we're renting houses, which is the reason why capitalists profit from [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1816.3999999999999s)]
*  those house rent prices. And they go up and up and up and up by 40% the last five years, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1822.16s)]
*  which is like the capitalists do what they always do. Like whenever there's a crisis, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1827.92s)]
*  economic crisis like Corona or the Ukraine war, like people are expecting that the prices go up. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1832.48s)]
*  So, and as they were expecting that the prices go up, like the capitalists took the prices and [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1839.68s)]
*  just skyrocketed them to like to the max. So they did maximum profits over the last couple of years, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1845.44s)]
*  and everyone's blaming it on the foreigners, which is kind of crazy because like there's a [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1851.04s)]
*  German politician who's Gregor Gysi, who says like a couple of years ago, 10 years ago, there weren't [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1855.6s)]
*  as many foreigners in Germany as there are now. And the rent prices were up as well. And you didn't [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1861.52s)]
*  have just one euro more in your pocket. So how can the foreigners be responsible for the lack of [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1867.84s)]
*  money in your pocket? Which is a question that no one can answer. But like, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1874.96s)]
*  yeah, this is something that I talk about all the time. Undocumented migrants are not your [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1880.3200000000002s)]
*  landlords. Your landlords are the ones who are raising the rents and your politicians are the [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1883.8400000000001s)]
*  ones who are in the pockets of landlords who refuse to increase the housing supply. So that's [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1888.24s)]
*  a great way to communicate. I just seeing the rise of the AFD though, are people actually listening, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1896.5600000000002s)]
*  especially considering that, you know, the CDU also still improved its stances from what I [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1904.48s)]
*  understand, improved his standing, sorry, from what I understand. So you got, you got gains on [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1910.72s)]
*  the CDU side and you got major gains on AFD. What does that say about German politics as [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1916.72s)]
*  the state of German politics right now? Well, the German society just like they, they, they buy [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1921.3600000000001s)]
*  the picture of the bad illegal immigrant who's responsible for the shit that's happening. So we [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1927.04s)]
*  got historically low crime rates in Germany. Like the crime rates aren't as high as like the media [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1934.72s)]
*  and the people are trying to tell the German. We're just trying to like to build the feeling of [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1940.0s)]
*  you have to be afraid and you have to be afraid of the foreigner. It's the illegal immigrant is [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1948.0s)]
*  the source of all our problems. And if we get rid of them, if we get rid of the Muslims, like, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1953.44s)]
*  which is it's not the foreigners, it's just like the non-white people, like just say it as it is. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1958.24s)]
*  It's just straight up racism. We do not have a problem with like Ukrainian people or with Polish [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1963.52s)]
*  people or with French people. We have a problem with like the Muslims, like the Turks, the Arabic [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1969.2s)]
*  countries, like we have a problem with those people. So if you come to Germany and you're not [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1974.96s)]
*  white, you have a problem at the moment because people are buying that you're responsible for [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1978.8799999999999s)]
*  pretty much every problem that is in German, in Germany right now. So whether it being the crime [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1983.92s)]
*  rates, whether it being like economic crisis, whether it being like just pretty much imagine [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1988.88s)]
*  any problem and the answer from CDU and AFD and SPD and the Green Party is what it's illegal [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=1994.0s)]
*  immigrants. So I think 70% of the people who voted yesterday, the most important topic for them was [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2003.0400000000002s)]
*  illegal immigrants. 70%, which is crazy in 2021, like climate justice and well, like war and corona [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2011.2s)]
*  and stuff like that was on our agenda. So those were the topics that you could win an election [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2021.52s)]
*  with. This year, it's illegal immigrants. So and this is the reason why even the SPD and the Green [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2026.88s)]
*  Party focused on illegal immigrants and what we can do to get rid of the illegal immigrants, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2032.96s)]
*  which is pretty much nothing because like first and foremost, they're not illegal. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2039.04s)]
*  Second of all, it's because of the Dublin Endowment. So Germany is in a pretty privileged [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2043.76s)]
*  position that if we hold European law, then we do not have any immigrants whatsoever. No one can [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2048.08s)]
*  enter Germany because we're in the middle of it and we have no border. So we have no European border. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2056.08s)]
*  So no immigrant can enter Germany without breaking a law. So German politics at the moment are saying [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2061.6s)]
*  we do not want any immigrants whatsoever. We just want the ones who work, which is like a classic [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2068.96s)]
*  capital argument. You're not looking at the human, you're looking at the resource. If you work, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2076.56s)]
*  you're good. If you're not working, get the fuck out. Yeah. That's also an interesting position [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2082.24s)]
*  because I guess like Germany's right wing also has this position as opposed to like, I would say the [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2089.68s)]
*  British right wing, whereas the British right wing and even Brexit was caused not only because [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2097.04s)]
*  of their version of the quote unquote refugee and Islam problem, but beyond that, they were very [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2102.8s)]
*  frustrated with like Polish migrants coming in with not even migrants, but like a Polish workforce [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2108.64s)]
*  coming in, which they perceived as like displacing the existing British labor pool. And I feel like [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2114.16s)]
*  in Germany, there's a, there's a difference where some of the right wing parties still have a very [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2120.8s)]
*  like hardline approach, which is maybe born out of German history post-World War II bringing in [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2125.04s)]
*  migrants specifically to work in German industry Turks, obviously being a, a major group here [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2131.92s)]
*  where they just simply look at it with a, with, with this cold approach where they're like, yeah, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2141.04s)]
*  you could come in, you just have to work for much cheaper. Does the, is the AFD's stance on this [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2147.6s)]
*  similar or do they want to, do they want to just eradicate all across the board, like no more migrants [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2154.64s)]
*  whatsoever in public? Yes. Like in public, like, like people like Alice Weidel, he's like, she's, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2162.8799999999997s)]
*  she's someone who's in public saying that we need immigrants. And as long as you're paying your taxes, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2171.52s)]
*  doing your work, as long as you assimilate, you're fine. And you have nothing to worry about behind [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2178.16s)]
*  closed doors. Like the AFD is under, it's run by Nazis, like just straight up literal Nazis. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2183.52s)]
*  Like the same guy, right? That dude is like a straight up Nazi. Yeah, yeah, he is. He is like, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2190.0s)]
*  he's a fascist. He's a Nazi in every way. Like he'd, he'd walk next to Hitler if he'd had a chance to. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2195.84s)]
*  So the, the, the AFD is run by, by literal Nazis. And, but they trying, they trying to be [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2201.36s)]
*  like the, just like a mild liberal right-wing party. So we have no problem with foreigners [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2208.88s)]
*  in general. We have no problem with any race or any, any ethnicity or any religion in general. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2216.24s)]
*  It's just the criminal ones. And it's the ones that are not working and destroying our social state. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2223.12s)]
*  So in the nineties, we had some right-wing party, NPD, which is similar to NSDAP. It was a national [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2228.24s)]
*  party and they realized that the German society is not ready for like, for getting rid of all [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2235.12s)]
*  the foreigners. So they had to tell a story. And their story was that we have no problem with [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2242.72s)]
*  foreigners or immigrants, but we do have a problem with the criminal ones and the ones that are not [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2248.16s)]
*  working. And pretty much ever since, every right-wing party in Germany is doing the same story. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2253.44s)]
*  Like we're, we're super liberal. Like we're super friendly. Like the, the world, the world is our [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2260.56s)]
*  friend, but we have criminal ones and we have the non-working ones and we have to get rid of them. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2267.28s)]
*  So this is, this is also the, the public state of the, of the AFD, but behind closed doors, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2273.44s)]
*  make no mistakes. The party is run by Nazis. Yeah. So what do you, what do you suspect is going to [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2277.76s)]
*  happen for the future of German politics? I can tell you what I suspect is happening, which is that [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2285.36s)]
*  whichever governing coalition exists, it's going to be very right-wing. It's going to basically try to [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2292.1600000000003s)]
*  take up as many of the, I guess, quote unquote populist stances, like the right-wing nationalist [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2298.4s)]
*  stances that AFD has and, and, and try to get ahead of the nationalists, try to get ahead of [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2304.96s)]
*  the nationalists, like securing a governing coalition next time around. But in that process, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2313.12s)]
*  that capitulation will normalize more and more right-wing positions as it has already. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2318.08s)]
*  And then people will say, okay, well, we don't want the diet thing. We want the, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2324.16s)]
*  we want the real thing. Like we want the AFD. But my assessment is on this and that's precisely [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2328.3199999999997s)]
*  what's happening in the UK with the reform movement as well as people are immediately [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2337.2s)]
*  frustrated with the, the current labor administration and the, after years and years of [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2343.2799999999997s)]
*  Tory austerity, the labor administration has not really dramatically changed the, the direction of [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2349.52s)]
*  the British economy. So the reform movement is growing in the UK. And I think that the AFD will [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2357.04s)]
*  grow in Germany if left unchecked, if they don't actually change their policies. And I don't think [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2365.12s)]
*  they will. What do you say to that? Well, the link has an answer for that, which is called [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2372.24s)]
*  anti-fascist economies. So we need, we need a strong social state. We need to, we need to solve [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2378.0s)]
*  the problems that the people are having, like lower the rents, lower the prices, lower everything [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2384.7999999999997s)]
*  that is, that is like that the people are struggling with. And as long as the people are [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2391.12s)]
*  happy, fascists can't grow, which is pretty much a theory that goes around for a couple of years. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2395.2799999999997s)]
*  And we're trying to, to do that. It's pretty hard because we're not doing any of this. So [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2399.68s)]
*  we're going to get rid of some foreigners. Like the illegal immigrants will go like a couple of [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2405.44s)]
*  thousand of them will be deported. I don't know where, but they're going to get deported. And [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2409.7599999999998s)]
*  I thought they don't call it deportation. They call it remigration. I thought. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2415.44s)]
*  Yeah. Remigration is like it's, it's deportation. Yeah. No, I know. I'm just, I'm joking, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2419.6800000000003s)]
*  but that is what, cause like, I feel like deportation in and of itself as a, has a [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2424.2400000000002s)]
*  different meaning in the minds of Germans, at least for German history. So they, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2428.88s)]
*  so they actively, even the AFD will try to actively liberalize their, their reactionary sentiment here [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2433.2000000000003s)]
*  and say, no, no, no, no, no, we don't want deportations. We want remigration. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2439.92s)]
*  Yeah. Remigration is a, it's a, it was, it was a huge scandal because remigration is just like [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2444.32s)]
*  deportation, a word that Germans don't use. We call it, well, let's, let's get them back home. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2450.8s)]
*  So we're, we're euphemizing everything that has to do with deportation, but it's deportation. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2456.8s)]
*  Like we're going to get them to prisons if we don't know where, where to put them. So [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2461.28s)]
*  it's deportation. Like we're going to deport a couple of thousands of them and all problems [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2464.8s)]
*  going to get solved. So the people are still angry and then the AFD is gonna, is gonna rise [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2469.04s)]
*  even more in my, in my opinion, cause like the AFD is a, is a party that can go even further than [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2476.96s)]
*  what the CDU and the SPD is doing right now. So right now we're talking about illegal immigrants. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2485.12s)]
*  So, but where are you going to do if the illegal immigrants aren't in your country anymore? You go [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2490.4s)]
*  to the immigrants, right? You take the illegal and you get rid of the, the word illegal and [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2494.08s)]
*  you just take the immigrants, like the non-white people in Germany. So the AFD is gonna, is gonna [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2498.8s)]
*  radicalize even more or just take more of their already radicalized ideology to the public. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2505.76s)]
*  And let's hope that the German population doesn't, doesn't swallow that pill. Like I'm hopeful, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2513.36s)]
*  I'm motivated because the link is, is a, is a really strong party. And I think that as of right [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2519.76s)]
*  now, we have a huge left-wing movement in the German youth. So we can, we can mobilize the people [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2526.32s)]
*  for class war and be, be a good, a solidarity force and like just, just put some millions Germans [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2532.48s)]
*  on the streets. Like we're not, Germans usually aren't protesting as much as they are in, in, in [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2540.56s)]
*  France or in America, but we've got to get used to that, I guess. So what do you say to people that [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2545.6800000000003s)]
*  claim that the link is advancements simply were to take away from SPD and Grunews, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2553.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, they, they just basically took some of the SPD and green party voters and that it's [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2559.6s)]
*  ultimately marginal. And then the other question that I have for you also is why the AFD is so [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2567.04s)]
*  popular in Eastern Germany, because a lot of Americans don't understand the difference and, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2573.4399999999996s)]
*  and think that it is because, you know, that's where all the migrants are. That's where all the [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2581.28s)]
*  migrant crime is or whatever. But I think that they don't, they don't understand what the actual, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2584.96s)]
*  the full picture is. No. So first question, yes, that's true. Like 600,000 voters, just directly [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2589.84s)]
*  voted the link instead of Grunew. So obviously the day they take voters from SPD and the green party. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2597.2000000000003s)]
*  But I think it's a good thing because SPD and the green party aren't left winged. So, and the link [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2604.96s)]
*  is. So if you're a left winger, you got to vote for a left party if you're voting. So having a [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2613.52s)]
*  strong left wing party in the, in the parliament is pretty important. And standing up for what you [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2621.36s)]
*  believe in is also very important if you believe in democracy and parliamentism. So if you vote as [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2627.6s)]
*  a left wing in Germany, you can't vote tactical for the SPD or the green party because you're [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2632.96s)]
*  basically going to get the same politics that you're going to get with the CDU. So CDU with SPD, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2639.12s)]
*  there's no difference from, from CDU and the green party. It would have been the same. And why are [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2645.76s)]
*  they like more right wing people in Eastern Germany? Because Eastern Germany's economies are [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2652.48s)]
*  even more fucked than in Western Germany. Like in the nineties, in the nineties, West Germany, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2660.4s)]
*  like the, when the Soviet Union failed and the DDR, when the DDR was being like took over by [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2666.96s)]
*  Western Germany, like from that point on, West Germany fucked Eastern Germany whenever they [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2675.2000000000003s)]
*  had the chance to. Like we privatized everything. Like there, there are a lot of people that are [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2680.32s)]
*  unemployed. Like they lost their houses, they lost their money, they lost their properties, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2685.68s)]
*  they love their working place, they love everything. And Western Germany privatized whatever [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2689.44s)]
*  they wanted to. So whatever, like whenever there's an, there's a crisis, the crisis hits Eastern [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2694.72s)]
*  Germany even harder than, than, than West Germany, which is the reason why the people in Eastern [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2702.3999999999996s)]
*  Germany are much more radicalized, like 30% AFD and 15% Die Linke. Yeah. And also, one [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2707.2799999999997s)]
*  note here, but yes, Americans don't understand this, but like there are more, I guess, quote, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2715.6s)]
*  unquote foreigners in Western Germany than there are in the Eastern Germany territories [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2721.12s)]
*  that the AFD actually dominated. And a similar thing actually happens in America as well. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2726.72s)]
*  So many rural areas that are not diverse at all, make these anti-diversity picks, these [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2732.56s)]
*  anti-diversity initiatives, they get swept away by that thinking that, you know, black and brown [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2740.2400000000002s)]
*  people are coming in and changing their culture or taking their jobs, stealing their jobs. When in fact, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2746.32s)]
*  it's quite literally not the case and more diverse environments with actual like places where there [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2753.52s)]
*  are actually undocumented immigrants, for example, in higher numbers are oftentimes [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2760.16s)]
*  Democratic Party strongholds in general. Yeah. Well, obviously, like whenever, like wherever [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2767.52s)]
*  there's a university in Eastern Germany, like people are voting left-winged. So when there's, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2773.2s)]
*  when there's people around and the cities, they have diverse, then they're not voting AFD. Like [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2778.32s)]
*  it's pretty much the same all around the country. Like if you, if, if a white person meets a non-white [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2784.24s)]
*  person and realize, well, he's not as bad as I thought, then like things change for the better. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2790.0s)]
*  But Eastern Germany has like, I think between two and seven percent foreigners. Whereas in [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2796.56s)]
*  Western Germany, it's like 30, 35 percent, even 40 in some cities. Yeah. Okay. Well, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2803.04s)]
*  thank you so much for coming on that you want to say before I let you go. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2812.24s)]
*  Well, it's not like German politics aren't as different from the American ones. It's just like [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2819.92s)]
*  we have more parties doing the same thing. Like in America, you got two parties basically doing [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2825.12s)]
*  the same thing in Germany. We have like six of them and a lot or 20. So it's, it's, it's all [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2829.6s)]
*  around the world. It's the same. Yeah. That's, that's what I try to describe to people. I mean, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2834.4s)]
*  I come from a background in Turkish politics where like you, I understand what it's like when [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2840.7999999999997s)]
*  you have a multi-party parliamentary structure, which I mean, Turkey's now presidential system, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2845.44s)]
*  there's a constitutional reform that took place. But, you know, I, I, the, the, the alignment still [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2849.92s)]
*  basically falls into the, the two different camps. And oftentimes there's still a unit party [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2858.64s)]
*  understanding, at least in America, there's a lot of unit party when it comes to deregulation. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2865.6800000000003s)]
*  It's, it's mostly in the margins, those differences like the Democrats will deregulate [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2871.04s)]
*  marginally less than the Republicans. But ultimately when it comes to foreign policy, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2876.08s)]
*  it's completely unit party as well. Having said that in the European parliamentary structures, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2882.4s)]
*  the coalitions that they build basically create the same exact outcome. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2888.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's neoliberalism. Like, like everywhere you look at it's just, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2894.88s)]
*  it's the same in America as it is in Europe. And especially in Germany, like we profit from [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2900.08s)]
*  capitalism all around the place and we turn to fascism whenever there's a crisis. So that's, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2905.12s)]
*  that's the same, like it's happening to you in America and it must be very hard to be a left [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2909.92s)]
*  wing in America at the moment. So stay strong to my comrades in America, just stay strong. And like, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2915.44s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know, like, I really don't know what to do against Trump because he's like [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2921.04s)]
*  pretty much doing the German playbook as of right now. Yeah. Oh, you mean the old German playbook, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2925.7599999999998s)]
*  the old German playbook, the liberal one, but he's doing the old German one. Oh yeah. It's, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2931.52s)]
*  it's Connie. Like you say, history repeats itself, but I could not think that it would [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2936.88s)]
*  repeat itself in America, but it is. Oh yeah. No, it is. And it took, it took less than a [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2942.4s)]
*  hundred years for us to just like snap back because I guess, you know, capitalism is inevitably going [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2948.8s)]
*  to yield crisis. And in that crisis, you're going to fascist will obviously create a semblance of [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2955.44s)]
*  stability. And in that circumstance, capitalists have a decision to make where do they still want [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2961.36s)]
*  to maintain the same old hierarchies, even if it's done with the, with the steel grip of fascists, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2967.92s)]
*  will they be able to restore order that way as long as they retain the same hierarchies [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2975.28s)]
*  or will they, will they join the right side of history and maybe actively fight against it? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2980.32s)]
*  But I do think that one thing is clear and that is that neoliberalism is on its last leg in general, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2987.6s)]
*  born out of all of its victories in the, in the post-Cold War era, in my opinion. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=2995.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, if we're not, if we're not solving the problem, then the climate is going [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=3000.08s)]
*  to solve the problem, right? It just pretty much, I mean, it's going to wipe us all out. Yeah. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=3005.52s)]
*  Or nuclear war. Who knows? Who knows? It's going to be, it's going to be a good times in the future. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=3010.4s)]
*  Good times in the future. Well, last words, stay strong to my comrades in America. Just, just never, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=3017.12s)]
*  never give up, never, never take a step back from fascism. Like as a German, I know what you're, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=3023.12s)]
*  what you're going through at the moment, although not in person, but my, like my ancestors did. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=3028.64s)]
*  It's a pretty rough time, but rough times always, like we're going to come through, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=3034.48s)]
*  like you're going to come through. Let's hope Germany is not taking the same path. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=3040.48s)]
*  All right. Thanks a lot, Carl. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLxeB5ZQdhA&t=3044.16s)]
