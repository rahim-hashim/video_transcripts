# Iron Dome Got Hacked? | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs)
*  Interceptors off the side of the building that we saw. Wait. Oh my god. Oh my god. That was an anti-air. That was an anti-air that. Oh my god. Oh my god. Are they? Did they actually hack these? What the hell's going on? That's a misfire. Wait, why did this stop? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=0.0s)]
*  Sirens are now lit up in Tel Aviv. Oh my god. AP having the chat live is crazy. There's so many Turks in here saying Allah Baba Geliyo. Ah, how you do Hussein Alak. You know, yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=20.0s)]
*  Here's Tharmer's personal motivation for being for playing an active role for playing an active role in Israel's campaign is so crazy because like there's no there's no real. Oh, what the. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=44.0s)]
*  Oh, interceptors off the side of the building that we saw. Wait. Oh my god. Oh my god. That was an anti-air. That was an anti-air that. Oh my god. Oh my god. Are they? Did they actually hack these? What the hell's going on? That's a misfire. Wait, why did this stop? Camera quickly turned away. I'm confused. Camera very quickly turned away and stop looking in that direction. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=63.0s)]
*  Look, look, you can see it from the building. One of them is deployed right here and it's supposed to be an interceptor and then it literally lands back in Tel Aviv. That interceptor was an 18 year old major general. Don't laugh. I don't know. Are the missile autists in the chat? Wait, they wait. No, the camera operator didn't doesn't suck as I think they stopped the feed. It's no longer live. Sirens cut out as well. No, they cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. They cut the feed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=91.0s)]
*  They cut the feed. They're not showing real time footage any longer. Oh my God. They cut it and then I think this is splice footage. Like look, look, look. No way. No way. It is. There are some pixels moving if you look closely. No, no, no. I'm saying there are pixels moving, but I feel like it's just wait. Maybe I'm crazy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=121.0s)]
*  Nearly all YouTube live stream showing Tel Aviv and Haifa. Skylines are being taken offline reportedly at the request of Israeli authorities. No, that's crazy. They're all showing the same footage now. And we will of course keep a close eye on the situation and what's happening over Israeli skies here on Al Jazeera. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=145.3s)]
*  Chat, there's probably there's probably a loop. I'm saying it feels like they they flick the camera. They flick the camera after the Iron Dome interceptor failing and they flicked it and then most likely put a loop on. I don't know. I don't know what's happened there. Now the camera is moving again. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. CNBC's feed is at a different angle with different lighting too. I don't think there's anything weird going on. Dude is just a live stream. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=165.0s)]
*  If I still worked in broadcast, I would have hooked you over some live feeds. I don't know why the sirens stop. Maybe the missiles incoming missiles stopped. I don't know. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=195.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're also clamping down on on read the AP pin on the live stream. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=212.5s)]
*  Our live streams are a view into some of the biggest events and moments every day. Donate to support AP journalism. What? That's the pin. What? They said the sirens are are set 90 seconds and don't go for the duration of the strike. Live link. What is this? It's not loading. CNN. This isn't this isn't new. What? No, this isn't new, bro. Get the f*** out of here. This is looped up too. Guys, come on, dude. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=218.8s)]
*  Oh my God, exercise a little bit of caution. A regime that is quite entrenched after 45 years of being empowered. There's like hella bot accounts that just try to generate traffic by putting fake shit up. He would know that the CNN 18 accounts. Some of them are actually CNN live feeds that they're resharing that they're streaming illegally. But a lot of them are often just like fake shit. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=242.9s)]
*  And as we're talking my one, we've heard another air raid siren in Tel Aviv there and what is being described as a misfire air defense rocket. Now, obviously so much of what happens next. I can't believe we watched that live hinges on the United States and on President Trump himself. We've heard mixed messages from from the administration. How do you assess Trump's position right now? Is he? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=269.4s)]
*  He's he's of course campaigned against being, you know, he wanted to be less interventionist. He's campaigned against wars in the Middle East. He said the US was not involved in the strikes against Iran. Do you think it's going to stay that way? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=297.4s)]
*  Look, the problem with Trump is that he's not reversed in foreign policy. He doesn't understand strategic calculus. I'm on AP. Chat, calm down. He's surrounded by yes. Is there a delay influenced by Netanyahu? Chat, test the delay. Subscribe now. See you on for $5 or $6 over free with the Twitch Prime. He's going to get the right advice on the wrong one. Okay, there is no delay. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=311.4s)]
*  In the chat, the G seven. He probably hear a bit more sobering advice. It's not to say that his European partners are, you know, holier than doubt. They're not. In fact, if you allow me, I'm just going to take a few seconds to to give you a bit of a perspective. Right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=341.4s)]
*  Regardless, when one thinks about the I don't know what happens to misfired munitions. I don't know if it like explodes before impact with the ground. No, there was just a plane drone, but you missed it. The fate of the Middle East, the fate of Iran. 70 years after they did that when they changed a government democratically elected in Iran in 1953, 5070 years later, we have a British government. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=361.4s)]
*  Prime Minister and an American president, the same type of characters that try to dominate, try to rob, try to redraw the Middle East. Then we are living those moments again. A bunch of white imperialists trying to redraw the Middle East with an attitude of an holier than doubt that they are supporting an ally, which is actually an implant for self defense. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=391.4s)]
*  Self defense when we all know, we all know that these are the same colonial imperial powers that try to run and divide the Middle East just a century earlier. It's kind of eerie to watch. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=418.4s)]
*  Maybe it was more so the flares as it was going down. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=430.4s)]
*  Talk about how Israel has the right to self defense and how the French and the British are silent and complicit and how the Americans are smug and say how excellent it is that Iran's being destroyed. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=433.4s)]
*  Again, you don't have to be a fan of the Iranian regime to know that this is going to lead to huge pent up violence in the Middle East. There are no victories in the Middle East. We've seen it happen and again and again over a century. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=446.4s)]
*  Every time Israel says it won a war, it came out victorious the past 70 years. For some reason it's fighting more and more wars. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=460.4s)]
*  What is also interesting here is that President Trump seems to have failed on all the big foreign policy issues that he promised he would solve quickly. They all seem to have gotten worse, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Russia or Ukraine. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=468.4s)]
*  There's no doubt that the false promise that I will resolve everything in 48 hours and 24 hours, of course, is all wishful thinking. And he said, well, I think it wasn't serious and all the rest of it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=481.4s)]
*  Not really understanding that these are very complex issues that have history. It's not a question of, as Biden framed it, terrorism against democracy or tyrannies against democracies. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=495.4s)]
*  None of that. It's a far more complicated issues. And the way again Netanyahu just framed it, we just heard it in his interview and APC saying that the Iranian regime is this and that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=508.4s)]
*  Yes, the Iranian regime was a destabilizing force and at least there's no doubt. But the person who are saying this is indicted on criminal charges by the way, even corruption in his own courts. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=519.4s)]
*  And his country and himself have been invading and occupying countries like there is no tomorrow. So to frame these things as democracies versus tyrannies, this is just another pretext, another tool of colonial imperial powers trying to redraw, trying to impose their will on the Middle East. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=531.4s)]
*  Trying to do whatever they need to do in order to stay on top. And this is not right. There's something wrong about trying to frame these things while at the same time defending or praising a country for unprovoked attack against another country, unprovoked against another country. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=549.4s)]
*  Iran, again, fan or not, is a signatory to the NPT, does not have nuclear weapons. The director of national intelligence of the United States said they are not pursuing nuclear weapons. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=567.4s)]
*  Israel is a nuclear power, is not a signatory to the NPT, is invading countries, is a genocidal government, at least in part as Gaza is concerned. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=581.4s)]
*  And yet we see all of these things being twisted around as if there's a Western Israeli holier than that attitude and everything in the Middle East is rotten and evil. This is just wrong. You won't. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=591.4s)]
*  As always, very good to hear your views. Thank you so much for your perspective. Marwan Bashar, our senior political analyst. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=604.4s)]
*  I just want to show our viewers now some of the images we were seeing just a moment ago from Israel when the air raid sirens went off. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=610.4s)]
*  And then we saw what I thought looked like a flare, but it was actually an interceptor missile that misfired shortly after the air raid siren went off. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=620.4s)]
*  And there it is. And this is all coming after Iran said it would retaliate following the attack on its state television building in Tehran, the Iranian saying that they were preparing for the largest and most intense missile attack in history on Israeli soil. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=632.4s)]
*  So we're keeping a close eye on the skies over Tel Aviv and other is the Iron Dome earlier today deployed an interceptor that ended up striking Tel Aviv anti-semitically. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=650.4s)]
*  We will find out the anti-semites responsible for the anti-semitism coming from the Tamir interceptors. However, has about one hundred thousand more reservists. Israel possesses three hundred and forty combat capable aircraft. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=664.4s)]
*  Those include several advanced US made F-35 fighter jets. The Iron Dome is Hamas. One of the operates an older fleet of Russian jets. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=676.4s)]
*  Among Israel's anti-missile systems at work, there is the Iron Dome that's designed to take down short range rockets usually coming from Gaza. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=682.4s)]
*  There's also the David Sling and the Arrow systems. They are domestically manufactured equipment designed to take down medium to long range ballistic and cruise missiles. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=691.4s)]
*  In Iran, the IRGC says they've designed their own air defense system called the BAVA 373, which has enhanced detection and tracking of aircraft and long range missiles. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=702.4s)]
*  Tehran also has two other systems, including a Russian made one. But neither of these three systems are capable of tracking self fighter jets. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=713.4s)]
*  Let's discuss all this further now with Colin Clark, who's the director of research at the Sufan Center, a global intelligence and security consultancy. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=722.4s)]
*  Colin is joining us from Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. So we've seen what each side has right now and given the Iranian threat to escalate further. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=731.4s)]
*  What do you think are the likely military scenarios right now if both sides continue these retaliatory strikes? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=741.4s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. Yeah, both sides are attempting to renegotiate the rules of engagement and redefine their own red lines, essentially attempting to establish or reestablish deterrence. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=751.4s)]
*  It's really going to be a kind of blow by blow account over the next at least 24 to 48 hours. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=763.4s)]
*  United States is moving a lot of military muscle into the region to help the Israelis. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=770.4s)]
*  And so I think we're likely to see continued fighting and escalation, at least for the for the near term. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=775.4s)]
*  Beyond that, President Trump has expressed some optimism that the Iranians are willing and ready to come to the negotiating table. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=781.4s)]
*  But I have my own doubts about that based on what I've seen. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=788.4s)]
*  Colin, what is your assessment of the level of destruction of the targets that each side has been aiming for in these past five days? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=792.4s)]
*  How significant are they in terms of operational and symbolic impact? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=801.4s)]
*  So it's still too early for a formal battle damage assessment. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=807.4s)]
*  But symbolically, both sides are, you know, absorbing blows, pretty significant blows, if we've seen the recent Iranian attack against Israeli energy infrastructure in Haifa. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=811.4s)]
*  And the Israelis now with air superiority and air dominance have had their pick of going after various surface to air missiles and Iranian anti-missile defense system. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=823.4s)]
*  So this is a real knockdown, drag out conflict. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=836.4s)]
*  It's really what we've all been hoping to avoid since October 7th, 2023. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=839.4s)]
*  So do you think we're looking at a protracted low intensity conflict or something with the potential to spill over into a broader regional war? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=844.4s)]
*  Well, it's hard to sustain this level of intensity, this operational tempo, because the blows have been so severe. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=854.4s)]
*  Although the Iranians have said and have attempted to make clear that they've been holding back their most strategic and advanced weaponry, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=861.4s)]
*  whether or not that's true or if that's simply a threat yet to be seen. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=868.4s)]
*  Although what's happening right now as we speak could be part and parcel of that. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=872.4s)]
*  I think, you know, we're likely to get some clarity again over the next day or two. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=877.4s)]
*  I'm hoping that we don't see a broader conflagration through the region. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=882.4s)]
*  And one of the reasons to be optimistic is that the axis of resistance have been significantly weakened already. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=887.4s)]
*  I was going to ask you about that because we the axis of resistance has been weakened. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=893.4s)]
*  Indeed, Hezbollah weakened in Lebanon. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=897.4s)]
*  But we have seen the Houthis in Yemen engage Israel. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=899.4s)]
*  We've seen missile strikes, attacks on Israel from Yemen. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=904.4s)]
*  Are we likely to see a greater involvement of the proxies? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=908.4s)]
*  We very well could. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=913.4s)]
*  It's something I've been watching closely. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=915.4s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised to see the Houthis become more active. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=916.4s)]
*  The big question becomes Hezbollah. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=920.4s)]
*  What are their capabilities at this point and what's their desire to actually get back involved in a tit for tat with the Israelis? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=922.4s)]
*  Hezbollah significantly weakened since the pager attack in September, since the targeted assassination of its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=929.4s)]
*  However, if Hezbollah feels that the Israelis are instigating something that they're probably not going to look for, we could see Hezbollah join the fray as well. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=937.4s)]
*  Colin Clark, good to get your insight. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=947.4s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us again on Al Jazeera. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=948.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=951.4s)]
*  As we heard earlier, the G7 summit in Canada, US President Donald Trump spoke to reporters about de-escalation efforts in this conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=953.4s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=962.4s)]
*  Have you heard any signals or seen any messages from intermediaries that Iran wishes to de-escalate the conflict? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=964.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=971.4s)]
*  What have you heard? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=972.4s)]
*  What have you heard from the Iranians? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=973.4s)]
*  They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=975.4s)]
*  I had 60 days and they had 60 days and on the 61st day I said, we don't have a deal. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=979.4s)]
*  Bro. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=985.4s)]
*  They have to make a deal. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=986.4s)]
*  You shot them. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=987.4s)]
*  It's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war and they should talk and they should talk immediately before it's too late. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=988.4s)]
*  And what would you say, in your opinion, what would it take for the US to get involved in this conflict militarily? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=997.4s)]
*  I don't want to talk about that. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1003.4s)]
*  We've always supported Israel. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1005.4s)]
*  We have for a long period of time, strongly. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1007.4s)]
*  And Israel is doing very well right now. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1009.4s)]
*  Let's discuss all this further now with Mohsen Milani, executive director of the Center for Strategic and Diplomatic Studies at the University of Florida. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1012.4s)]
*  He's joining us from Tampa. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1020.4s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Milani, for being with us again on Al Jazeera. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1021.4s)]
*  President Trump, they're calling for a deal to be done, but not really calling for de-escalation. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1024.4s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1030.4s)]
*  Thank you for the invitation. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1032.4s)]
*  President Trump's strategy from the very beginning was to put maximum pressure on Iran to accept American terms. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1035.4s)]
*  In other words, if I have to summarize it, it's either comply or be bombed, you choose. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1046.4s)]
*  And one of the key demands that the president has had from Iran is to dismantle its enrichment, uranium enrichment infrastructure in Iran. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1053.4s)]
*  And for the Iranian leadership to accept that, having spent billions of dollars to set up that infrastructure, would amount to a political suicide. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1066.4s)]
*  And therefore, they rejected it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1078.4s)]
*  However, they were pretty close to an agreement. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1080.4s)]
*  As a matter of fact, a few days before Israel launched its attack on Iran, American-Iranian negotiators were scheduled to meet. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1083.4s)]
*  And unfortunately, they haven't met yet. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1093.4s)]
*  And today, what the president is probably asking for, for Iran to accept before joining the negotiations, that they would surrender their nuclear program. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1097.4s)]
*  And I think this is unlikely for Iran to do at this time. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1113.4s)]
*  If they're not at this moment willing to stop uranium enrichment, as you say, what would it take for them to rejoin the negotiations? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1118.4s)]
*  What could convince them to get back to the negotiating table? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1130.4s)]
*  They should have been fucking enriching already, dude. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1135.4s)]
*  They should have had a nuke by now. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1138.4s)]
*  That way, they could have defended themselves from any sort of escalation. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1139.4s)]
*  And of course, Iran has to stop its attack on Israel. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1144.4s)]
*  As long as the two countries are engaged in a war, and as long as Tehran believes, as it does, that the U.S. is directly involved in these operations against Iran, Iran is unlikely to join the negotiating table. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1147.4s)]
*  However, if there is a ceasefire, I think it is likely that Iran... [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1164.4s)]
*  You need to be careful, Feds. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1169.4s)]
*  I mean, what do you mean? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1171.4s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1172.4s)]
*  From a... [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1176.4s)]
*  Oh, here's the other angle from the other side. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1178.4s)]
*  You kind of said Iran should nuke Israel? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1195.4s)]
*  No, dumbass. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1197.4s)]
*  There's a policy of nuclear deterrence. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1198.4s)]
*  It's called mutually assured destruction. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1200.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1203.4s)]
*  Countries that don't have nukes in the age of nuclear proliferation are clearly countries that don't have sovereignty. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1204.4s)]
*  Ukraine is a better example of this. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1212.4s)]
*  It is a consistent position that I've had. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1215.4s)]
*  And nuclear deterrence is the only thing that will fucking stop Israel from engaging in these kinds of actions. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1217.4s)]
*  The very fact that Iran doesn't have nukes is the reason why Israel is blowing the fuck up, blowing Tehran up. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1225.4s)]
*  Don't put words in my fucking mouth. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1232.4s)]
*  We just want you to be careful. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1234.4s)]
*  I am careful. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1235.4s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1236.4s)]
*  Yeah, nukes in India and Pakistan. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1244.4s)]
*  The IDF says it's over. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1249.4s)]
*  The IDF Home Front commands that civilians could leave bomb shelters after Iran's latest ballistic missile attack. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1252.4s)]
*  According to the initial IDF, SM is a small number of missiles were launched in the attack. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1257.4s)]
*  Even... But they said they were going to do a fucking crazy campaign tonight. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1261.4s)]
*  So the fact that it was just like a couple of missiles, let's see what that... [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1265.4s)]
*  They are disgusting to the Islamic Republic. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1269.4s)]
*  As a lot of people are, they think they need to come to the defense of the motherland. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1272.4s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister has made it. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1277.4s)]
*  Israel today, hard to tell if Iran is toying with us and intends to wake Israelis up every hour all night long, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1279.4s)]
*  or if they're simply no longer capable of launching a major barrage. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1285.4s)]
*  That is the question, isn't it? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1290.4s)]
*  First of all, let me be very clear. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1294.4s)]
*  Israel does not have the power to launch a regime changing Iran by itself. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1297.4s)]
*  That is an illusion. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1304.4s)]
*  They just don't have the capability. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1306.4s)]
*  They don't have the power to do so. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1309.4s)]
*  Unless the United States directly or indirectly agrees with it. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1311.4s)]
*  But the ramification of regime change are going to be absolutely profound, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1317.4s)]
*  much more destabilizing than what we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1322.4s)]
*  All I have to say, all I have to say, that we have had two experiences with regime change in Afghanistan and in Iraq. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1328.4s)]
*  The United States spent over $2.5 trillion with a T, $2.5 trillion. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1337.4s)]
*  What happened in Afghanistan after getting engaged in America's longest war in the history of this great country, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1345.4s)]
*  the United States of America, we ended up more or less accepting the rule by the Taliban, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1353.4s)]
*  the very force that we overthrew 20 years earlier. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1359.4s)]
*  And look at Iraq. Look what happened to Iraq. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1363.4s)]
*  And therefore, Americans and American people and a very major significant base that supported President Trump, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1366.4s)]
*  they are against these endless wars and these attempts to have regime change. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1376.4s)]
*  If the regime change comes by the Iranian people, that's fine. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1382.4s)]
*  But any kind of regime change that is exposed from outside, imposed from outside, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1386.4s)]
*  it could bring perhaps in the best case scenario short-term instability and long-term chaos and instability. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1391.4s)]
*  Thank you so much for talking to us and sharing your perspective. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1399.4s)]
*  Mohsen Milani, Executive Director of the Center for Strategic and Diplomatic Studies in the University of Florida. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1403.4s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1408.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1411.4s)]
*  Now, there are also the economic consequences. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1412.4s)]
*  Commodity markets have been volatile, driven by the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1415.4s)]
*  Oil prices have been spiking sharply. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1421.4s)]
*  About 20 percent of the world's oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1424.4s)]
*  At its narrowest, the waterway is about 33 kilometers wide, split between the territorial waters of Iran and Oman. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1427.4s)]
*  At times of diplomatic tension, Iran has in the past threatened to disrupt shipping traffic. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1434.4s)]
*  Naeem Aslam is Chief Investment Officer at ZEI Capital Markets. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1439.4s)]
*  He says the longer the conflict goes on, the wider the impact we could see in the markets. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1443.4s)]
*  Yes, a lot of focus among investors and traders. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1451.4s)]
*  It is all about the energy market and, of course, the recent attacks on the gas refineries over there. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1454.4s)]
*  What that would entail for the Europe, because there could be another crisis because of that, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1460.4s)]
*  because Iran plays a very, very imperative and important role with that one. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1464.4s)]
*  But the important aspect out of everything is that particular Hormuz pathway is not only for oil. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1469.4s)]
*  All the rest of the trade also does particular content and shifts that path. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1478.4s)]
*  So if that is... [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1485.4s)]
*  I'm in Iran and my internet is constantly cutting off. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1486.4s)]
*  So I don't know if you've covered this, but Iran started a new wave an hour ago. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1488.4s)]
*  They sent drones, 140, which take hours to arrive. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1490.4s)]
*  They'll then launch cruise missiles and normal missiles consecutively [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1493.4s)]
*  so that they all reach Israel at the same time around 3 or 4 a.m. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1496.4s)]
*  They're doing cyberattacks, cutoff, Iron Dome hitting itself, alarms malfunctioning and random missiles. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1500.4s)]
*  That makes more sense. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1506.4s)]
*  But I don't know why the idea was to release a statement saying you got the all clear, you can go outside. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1508.4s)]
*  Don't leak it. Chatters. What are you talking about? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1515.4s)]
*  If random people in Iran are aware of what the fuck's going on, you think the IDF doesn't know already? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1519.4s)]
*  They had the capabilities of building a fucking drone facility inside of Tehran. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1526.4s)]
*  What if you heard from the Iranians? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1532.4s)]
*  They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1534.4s)]
*  I had 60 days and they had 60 days and on the 61st day I said, we don't have a deal. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1538.4s)]
*  They have to make a deal and it's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1544.4s)]
*  And they should talk and they should talk immediately. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLSKGFm_BYs&t=1551.4s)]
