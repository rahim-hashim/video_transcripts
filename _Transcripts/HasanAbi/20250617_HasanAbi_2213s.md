# Trump’s Threat To Tehran Is INSANE | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E)
*  justification WMDs fake pretext to go and and wage war in an even larger country with an even [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=0.0s)]
*  more powerful military in mountainous territory that is basically designed geographically to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=8.08s)]
*  to be like a like a natural castle that will be incredibly costly in terms of human life and human [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=14.8s)]
*  casualties in Iran first and foremost. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=22.88s)]
*  All right, let's get started. First and foremost for also do we have do we have the playlist? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=30.96s)]
*  Why would Trump sending troops to Iran trigger World War Three? I mean, listen, World War Three [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=37.44s)]
*  is where battle lines are defined in one pole of the world one plank of the world being China and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=44.88s)]
*  the other one being America. Clearly all of the Western liberal nations are on board with [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=50.96s)]
*  American dominance and the continuation of American dominance. They like it. They totally [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=56.16s)]
*  are on board with it. They want it. They also are very bloodthirsty. Shouts out to the Germans, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  especially Germans are paying for blood. It feels like I would have never thought in my lifetime [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=66.16s)]
*  that I would see the Germans that post World War Two that like seemingly were pacified. They were [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=73.28s)]
*  like polite versions of the Nazis that they used to be turn around and start talking about in the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=78.72s)]
*  lamest and nerdiest ways like we must immediately go into war with Iran. Yeah, this is very important. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=84.48s)]
*  This is the most important thing. Also, we hate that there are so many refugees in our country [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=90.4s)]
*  as a consequence of America's destabilization in the region. But also we love the blood. We [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  love the bloodshed. I'm Israel high. Yeah, I love the bloodshed. I want them. I want them. We need [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  them. We love it. We love it. I love being the liberal and doing them all over. Yeah. Oh, my [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=111.84s)]
*  industry. Yeah. Frederick Merck said Israel isn't is doing the dirty work for the Western interview [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=120.56s)]
*  today. No, I know. That's what I'm referencing. Yeah. Israel is doing the dirty work for the West. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=126.16s)]
*  It's defending the West. Yeah. It's crazy. It's like, bro, know your place. Like it hasn't even [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  been 100 years since you did the man. Why are you so excited to do to I mean, you already are [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=139.12s)]
*  watching to unfold and you're defending it. But you also like directly want your hands to be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=144.8s)]
*  bloodied in right now. It's indirectly bloodied. But you're like, I want to have to have some more [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=150.96s)]
*  blood, blood. I love it. Anyway, that's where we're at with that's where I have the world. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=156.24s)]
*  But the reason why it's going to turn into World War Three is because again, Iran is a deeply [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  important strategic asset, both for oil and energy production for China, but also a stabilizing force [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  in the region for Chinese interests, as opposed to the rest of the region that is completely [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=182.72s)]
*  dominated and servile to American interest. So they don't want I don't think that China wants [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  Iran to fall by the wayside and turn into another like Syria situation, right? Because what happened [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=195.52s)]
*  to Syria and and how Syria's Syria falling was was consequential for Iran and Iran falling would [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=201.68s)]
*  be consequential for China. This is why I think it's like a World War Three style situation. MSM [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=210.96s)]
*  really isn't talking about the potential for China's involvement because the China is is the most [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=216.0s)]
*  restrained and the the most like cold calculated pragmatic country out there to a fault. They got [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=222.16s)]
*  crazy weapons too. They got good tech, crazy weapons, time to defend your assets, you know [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  what I mean? That's what I think. But in any case, Donald Trump has been going nutty mode, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=240.0s)]
*  talking big shit on the timeline. And that's obviously what we're going to start off with [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=246.24s)]
*  today. Because that's just the way politics runs nowadays. As you know, yesterday, he urged the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=250.8s)]
*  evacuation of Tehran, which is an incredibly large city. I believe it's like by some estimates, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=257.6s)]
*  people say like there's like 12 million people, some people say even more. There's in the greater [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=263.76s)]
*  metropolitan area, there's like at least 9 million people, you are not going to be able to evacuate [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=269.12s)]
*  9 million 15 million in the metro area. You're just not going to be able to do that. And people [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=275.84s)]
*  have been locked in. They some people have already started moving out of Tehran. And there's nowhere [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=282.16s)]
*  to really go. Because where are you supposed to go? They don't have gas. They Israel hit the largest [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=288.56s)]
*  oil depot in Tehran already. So people are having a hard time getting gas. And people are having a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=295.04s)]
*  hard time leaving the city to begin with. And Donald Trump is over here making threats like [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=301.36s)]
*  he's going to assassinate every single person like they're just going to drop it on Tehran or [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  something. It's so psychotic. It's so insane. Like Americans, we do not understand this, this feeling, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=309.6s)]
*  we will never understand this feeling. Because there is no force as powerful. And and as like, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=317.76s)]
*  there's no force on the planet that can threaten us in the same exact way. Not even China [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=327.04s)]
*  cannot, at least right now, cannot threaten us in the exact same way where they've like designed [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=334.32s)]
*  the entire rules of, of warfare and international rules and law and order to suit their purpose and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=338.56s)]
*  can strike and do things with impunity. Like there's no comparison, which is why we can't [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  comprehend what it's like to have like normal people have no say in what happens in their own [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=354.56s)]
*  lives. Something that Donald Trump might be saying simply because he, I hope you guys can maybe close [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=361.04s)]
*  your eyes for a brief moment and recognize the humanity of the Iranian people and recognize how [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=369.6s)]
*  devastating this kind of statement is without simply talking about how big, bold and brave and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=376.0s)]
*  beautiful our big, beautiful president is. Because like a lot of Americans are so callous [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=380.8s)]
*  in their indifference to, to dignity, to the dignity of human life when it's overseas, when it's [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=384.88s)]
*  supposedly a civilian population of a foreign adversary, you know, all Iran had to do was not [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  build, though not justifying this, but their government isn't innocent either. You're an idiot. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=397.36s)]
*  First of all, Iran hasn't built, they should have built, they literally should have built, because [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=401.44s)]
*  if Iran had built, Donald Trump couldn't say, Tehran, clear out. So ironically, it is actually [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=405.84s)]
*  the government's incompetence, I would say, that has caused them to try and play ball with America [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=411.44s)]
*  and play ball with the Western world over and over again, as the Western world has slapped them [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=417.44s)]
*  around. Can Donald Trump tweet out Moscow clear out? No, obviously not. And Moscow and Russia has [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  done a metric ton of damage to Ukraine. So why can't Donald Trump say, Hey, Kremlin clear out? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  Why can't they say, Hey, DPRK clear out? Pyongyang clear out? Why can't they say that? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=435.36s)]
*  Oh, that's right, because they have. Okay, that's it. You gotta have if you're not, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=442.32s)]
*  if you want to have sovereignty outside of the sphere of NATO influence outside of the sphere, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  the protective banner of the West. And by the way, ironically, when you are in the NATO protective [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  banner, you don't have any sovereignty. Look at Turkey. Okay, you got nothing. So yeah, it actually [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=458.8s)]
*  is an issue for Iran that they don't have news. They should have. They should have if they did, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=464.56s)]
*  the region will be more stable. Yeah, they have no they've been three years away for 35 years [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=472.48s)]
*  because they're not building them. Anyone who's buying this narrative is either politically [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=478.32s)]
*  illiterate or one of the new age conservatives zoomers too young to know the history. I know [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=481.36s)]
*  Iran has been three seconds to midnight on this stuff for the past 35 years chatters. If they [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  wanted to make them they could have you think the DPRK was you think that the Democratic People's [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=492.8s)]
*  Republic of Korea were able to literally withstand a famine in the process like one of the most [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  devastating famines of all time. And then at the same time, develop a nuclear program and engage in [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=505.12s)]
*  the enrichment of uranium before Iran could you do know how connected Iran is to the rest of the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=512.88s)]
*  world as opposed to the DPRK? Do you know how like I mean, if Ron has colleges, academics, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=519.2s)]
*  people that actually regardless of the government being treated as a foreign adversary, people who [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  are free travel all around the world, espionage capabilities, if Iran wanted to make they would [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=531.0400000000001s)]
*  have made them by now. And honestly, they probably should have made them by now. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people are maybe too young or too, too, too oblivious to the reality of how this [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=542.64s)]
*  like nuclear proliferation conversation has gone on when a country like, I mean, I joke there's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=552.4s)]
*  the Hassanabi doctrine, but it's a joke, but it's also real. Okay. What do I always say for nation [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=558.8s)]
*  building the Hassanabi doctrine for nation building? We joke, we present it as a, as a meme, but like [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=565.6s)]
*  it's real. Right. Rule number one, get rule number two, never give up the rule. Number three, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=570.32s)]
*  if Western powers claim you have drop everything and get immediately, because once they say you [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  have, even if you don't have them, if you don't ever get them, that means they're just going to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=583.84s)]
*  destroy you. Ukraine is a great example of a country that gave up its look at what's going on [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  with Ukraine. Libya is a country that cast aside any sort of like ambition for nuclear proliferation [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  and America still claimed that they had, and they didn't. And look at Libya now, Iraq, WMDs. Oh, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=599.2s)]
*  they have a yellow cake in rich uranium WMDs. We have to go in and we have to check it out. Iraq [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=606.24s)]
*  didn't have, I say this as someone who was an advocate for denuclearization universally. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=612.88s)]
*  I mean, nuclear power as an energy grid is fine. You guys have bullied me too much and that's okay. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=620.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm on board with nuclear power plants, but as far as like nuclear weapons goes, I'm anti. Okay. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=627.12s)]
*  I think no one should have, but as long as nuclear proliferation continues and the West basically [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=634.88s)]
*  bullies every country that doesn't have, without any sort of scrutiny, without any sort of push [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=642.48s)]
*  back whatsoever you need. All right. Let's get to the state department press briefing real quick. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=647.04s)]
*  Um, I believe it's starting soon, right? Here's what yellow cake press conference. Okay. Stop [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=651.8399999999999s)]
*  actually send me the state department. I don't want to, I don't care about John Stewart's [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  statement. Send me the link for the press department, please. Send me the link for the [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=661.92s)]
*  press department, please. Secretary of state Marco Rubio has also stated that fact as he's working [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=666.64s)]
*  to implement president Trump's vision of peace and security. That statement has also been uttered [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=674.4s)]
*  from this podium many times. The fact that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, uh, is clear. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=679.44s)]
*  As the white house reminds us since taking office, president Trump has clearly stated [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=686.72s)]
*  no fewer than a dozen times that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon for anyone who's [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=691.5200000000001s)]
*  no, you understand America first and being a peaceful dove actually meant doing the exact [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=697.5200000000001s)]
*  same thing that previous administrations have done, which is to go to war with Iran. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=702.8000000000001s)]
*  America first actually means, uh, doing a decapitation strike on the supreme leader [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=708.0s)]
*  of Iran. America first actually means like violating, uh, violating any sort of isolation [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=712.72s)]
*  as principle that we might've actually run a campaign on in the country where you are. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=719.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Unless you're in Israel, in which case, uh, the Israeli government doesn't want you to [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=724.32s)]
*  yeah, I know Trump leaked a Mike Huckabee's text message. I read this this morning. What an insane [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  screenshot. I didn't even know you could screenshot something this long. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=734.88s)]
*  I don't know how Trump's screenshot of this. By the way, notice how the state department [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=738.64s)]
*  press briefings are damn near identical in their, in their response to the previous state department, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=743.04s)]
*  regardless of how different things are. Okay. My goats are there. Go on the countries that [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=747.92s)]
*  they're in. I guess, I guess is Prem not there. I don't see him. Right. Um, well, I guess they [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=756.8s)]
*  revoked a press credential. This is live. Yeah. There is always LL. I believe has resumed flights [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=762.8s)]
*  and some small measures. Why is she there? You know, some people have kids in Israel and they [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=772.4799999999999s)]
*  were visiting the States. Contact your local. Andrea Andrea Mitchell's is like a super high [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=777.76s)]
*  level CNN commentator who normally would not play the function of a [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=784.4s)]
*  national security reporter, like a state department reporter. But [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm Oh, MSNBC. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. MSNBC. So this is like, they don't send people like her [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=801.5999999999999s)]
*  normally to state department briefings. It is quite bizarre that she's there. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=810.24s)]
*  Um, yeah, she's married to Alan Greenspan. Like this is like a like a super OG, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=816.8000000000001s)]
*  longtime reporter, solid track record. I wouldn't say solid track record, but like, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=822.64s)]
*  when you're a reporter and you get to the point of high level commentator, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  you don't you don't actually sit through these press briefings. Okay. It's like, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=832.48s)]
*  is Jake Tapper there? No. Do you understand what I mean? It's like, it's like sending Jake Tapper [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=836.1600000000001s)]
*  there. Someone said solid. Oh, she stepped down from anchor chair on MSNBC and is now a correspondent [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=840.56s)]
*  for NBC. She got demoted. I'm certainly not going to characterize what President Trump says or [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=845.8399999999999s)]
*  tweets. She's also unsurprisingly very pro Israel. It's like sending Wolf Blitzer. Yeah. So like all [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=851.76s)]
*  these guys, obviously at a certain point were, you know, loyal, loyal little soldiers in the media [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=858.56s)]
*  that did like their quote unquote journalism. They did their reporting only to get elevated [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=865.76s)]
*  to the highest status. The highest status in the media is like when you become like a New York [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=871.36s)]
*  Times op-ed writer, or when you become, or when you basically become a, a commentator, like with [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=875.76s)]
*  your own show, with your name associated with it to stop peacefully where American citizens, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=883.76s)]
*  I'm losing my mind. Stop asking about American citizens being allowed to leave Israel. Oh my God, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=889.92s)]
*  that is sure it's relevant, but it's the least relevant part of this. Please ask about what the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=895.68s)]
*  administration is planning to do. Please prod some questions. Why are tankers moving into the region? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=901.5999999999999s)]
*  Why are there bombers in the region? Does Donald Trump need congressional authorization? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  We know the answer, but at least it's important to have it on the record. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=913.92s)]
*  Yes. The answer is yes. The answer is yes. Everybody knows this. Israel wants regime change. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=917.92s)]
*  America wants regime change. They want it. The point is, will they try to get it by [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=922.96s)]
*  doing a decapitation strike? Who will they actually try to put in the position of power? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=929.84s)]
*  Will a decapitation strike be successful? Okay. All right. I'm cutting this. This, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  this fucking briefing is so stupid. Okay. These, these press briefings are always bad. They are [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  not designed to give you actual information. They're designed for the state department to lie. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=950.48s)]
*  And I just wanted to show you how the, the, the similarities are between like the previous one [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=957.52s)]
*  with, you know, Matt Miller, who now considers what Israel's doing is war crimes or whatever, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=964.08s)]
*  as opposed to what is going on currently. Yap Miller Trump's desire to handle the escalating [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=968.56s)]
*  conflict in the middle East diplomatically is waiting officials familiar with the ongoing [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=974.64s)]
*  discussions. Tell CNN Trump is growing increasingly warm to using us military assets [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=977.68s)]
*  to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. This is basically the same holding position, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=981.68s)]
*  the holding pattern that we've been in, as I said yesterday, and I will keep repeating over and over [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=985.92s)]
*  again, the situation is, is basically identical to Iraq. Okay. It is identical to Iraq. We are, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=990.9599999999999s)]
*  are at the precipice of a fake reason, fake justification, WMDs, fake pretext to go and, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1002.48s)]
*  and wage war in an even larger country with an even more powerful military in mountainous [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1010.4s)]
*  territory that is basically designed geographically to, to be like a, like a natural castle [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1017.36s)]
*  that will be incredibly costly in terms of human life and human casualties in Iran. First and [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  foremost, and then also for American troops as well. This is Iraq war 2.0 coming from the guys [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1031.44s)]
*  who claimed that they were anti-Neo con coming from the administration that successfully ran [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1039.92s)]
*  and one positioning themselves as antagonistic to the Iraq war. But this time it's different. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1045.92s)]
*  That's where we're at. Now. I don't know. I don't know if they will continue along with this [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1052.8s)]
*  ambition, or if they're just simply doing like the, the Trump madman doctrine, which has, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1058.32s)]
*  which has happened in the past as well with like custom Suleimani's assassination, for example, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1064.72s)]
*  Trump does something absolutely insane that under normal conditions would be considered a severe [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1070.48s)]
*  violation of another country's sovereignty. But then there is not much response from said country [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1076.32s)]
*  this time, Iran again. And then they get back to the bargaining table or whatever. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1081.52s)]
*  And, and the only reason why this has worked so far is because of the unimaginable power that [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1088.56s)]
*  America has in the region, unimaginable power it has in terms of like doing damage to the civilian [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1094.32s)]
*  population and the lack of appetite from countries like Iran to, to kill their whole population, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1100.0s)]
*  like throw their population in the, in the field of fire under American munitions. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1108.32s)]
*  That is the only thing that has stopped Iran's restraint is the only thing that has stopped [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1114.56s)]
*  world war three from unfolding. And it's not because of the, the, the brilliant calculations [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1120.0s)]
*  of, of Donald Trump. It's I it's almost identical to like the way that Kissinger operated bullying [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1125.9199999999998s)]
*  all of these other smaller countries and just like brutalizing them over and over again, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1131.9199999999998s)]
*  pummeling them doing a of war crimes in Asia, knowing full well that there was no retaliation [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1135.68s)]
*  that could ever that America would ever meet. The only major difference between right now, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1144.8s)]
*  the only major difference between what's unfolding right now and 2003, however, is that there is one [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1151.3600000000001s)]
*  no nine 11 component to we're living in the post anti Iraq war meta where Americans like [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1157.28s)]
*  recognize the war on terror as being overwhelmingly a failure, right? And on top of that, I would say [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1165.12s)]
*  that we have a tremendous, tremendous economic instability, which I think plays a role in [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1173.6799999999998s)]
*  Americans not feeling as patriotic or the Western world in general, not feeling as patriotic about [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1182.3999999999999s)]
*  their countries, like not feeling as though they are willing to go and serve in the in the military [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1187.12s)]
*  to like defend Western nations or whatever. It's like they can't pay rent. Why the fuck like most [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1193.92s)]
*  people, if you ask like Gen Z, they're like, Oh, would you serve in the American military? Would [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1200.0s)]
*  you serve in the British military? And they're like, I'm not going to die for someone else's [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1203.28s)]
*  wars. Like, why would I do that? I can't even pay from rent. And on top of that, there's tremendous, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1207.28s)]
*  tremendous enmity towards Israel. There's tremendous anger and resentment towards Israel. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1212.24s)]
*  In the, in the public's eye, politicians are united on defending Israel, but the American [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1217.76s)]
*  population even is not so united. It's one of the most common metas right now is like, I'm not dying [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1226.48s)]
*  for Israel. I'm not dying for Israel. That's like the rallying call of an entire generation. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  So when you look at that, when you look at the situation with, with deep economic volatility, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1238.56s)]
*  deep uncertainties about people's futures, anger and resentment, and, and try to slap on a, a [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1245.92s)]
*  additional war that is even more costing the previous wars that America is engaged in that [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1253.8400000000001s)]
*  are deeply unpopular. I don't know if Americans will be on board with this. I feel like this could [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  potentially destabilize the entire Western world if implemented. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe America [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1264.0s)]
*  will find a way to nip this in the bud and, and have this like full throated, full throated [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1271.36s)]
*  pro-war propaganda that they've been pummeling, that they've been pumping out on every outlet [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1278.7199999999998s)]
*  right now. They've been doing that. They've been doing that nonstop. If you notice like CNN and [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1284.08s)]
*  New York Times is, is damn near identical with the way that you hear commentary from Fox News on this [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1288.8799999999999s)]
*  stuff. There are very few outspoken anti-war people out there. You got some crazies on the right. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1296.08s)]
*  Some of the, some of the most like crazy MAGA people are coming out against it. But then also, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1302.8s)]
*  also you got like the AOCs and the Thomas Massey and the Republican party and the, and the Bernie [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1308.8s)]
*  Sanderses of the, of the Democrats that are coming out against it. But overall Democrats and [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1313.6799999999998s)]
*  Republicans, especially at the highest levels of the party are fully on board with escalating this [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1319.92s)]
*  conflict and moving in to Iran. You are genuinely stupid if you think the whole world will end [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1326.4s)]
*  because you acting like it's the Combine seven hour invasion of earth, which was worse. You act [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1331.8400000000001s)]
*  like you're the leftist tough guy. You would not last a single second in City 17 and nobody is crazy [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1335.44s)]
*  except the people you hired to ban for you. You act like this is the Combine seven hour invasion [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1340.72s)]
*  of earth. You would not last a single second in City 17. Are you, do you think, do you think [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1345.92s)]
*  half life two is real life anyway? All right. But yeah, let's get back to it. President Trump urges [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1352.88s)]
*  evacuation of Tehran as the Iran Israel conflict deepens. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1360.5600000000002s)]
*  We're going to begin with Israel stepping up its bombing of Iran and a blunt new warning from [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1365.1200000000001s)]

*  regime change in Iran. Worst kept secret of all time, by the way, Israel wants regime change. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1401.9199999999998s)]
*  The US is fine with that sources say almost about everything regarding Israel and Iran. Trump knew [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1407.36s)]
*  what Israel was going, Israel was going to attack Iran, knew the basic outlines of the strategy and [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1411.9199999999998s)]
*  implicitly gave the US okay. Trump also quietly and enthusiastically embraces Israel's unstated [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1416.3999999999999s)]

*  Trump hasn't officially approved anything, hasn't committed anything to paper and hasn't signed off [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1425.28s)]
*  on any specific act. But in the dance of phone calls and back channel messages and things said [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1429.76s)]
*  and not said, the two countries found agreement. Trump has given Israel the green light by not [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1436.48s)]
*  saying no, they're calling it the yellow card or the yellow light. They're saying it's not a green [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1441.76s)]

*  Israel wants to do, you can do. We're not going to say no. This is the world of state crowds at the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1451.6s)]

*  the context of Hamas war off the table. Instead, Israel in 2024 carried out a spate of assassinations [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1513.6799999999998s)]
*  of extremely high level adversaries. First Israel killed a mosque leader, Ismail Hani and Tehran. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1519.6799999999998s)]
*  Then they bombed an Iranian embassy building in Damascus, killing high ranking Iranian generals. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1524.6399999999999s)]
*  For the record, all of these things that happened under the watchful gaze of the Biden administration [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1529.4399999999998s)]
*  was directly a violation of numerous red lines. And it was reliant on a hopeful Iranian restraint [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1534.32s)]
*  that actually did exist restraint to restraint paired up with Iranian naivete, I would say. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1543.52s)]
*  And the Biden veto wasn't necessarily a veto in terms of like, oh, too many civilians are going [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1550.08s)]
*  to die as Ken is reporting here from these official sources, anonymous sources. But it's more so now [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1556.8s)]
*  is not the right time. Now that actually the axis of resistance has been entirely gutted [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1563.44s)]
*  and there is a very few striking capabilities that can come from all of the fronts, with the exception [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1569.68s)]
*  of Yemen, basically now that Syria is toppled and Hezbollah is decapitated. And even like all of the [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1577.04s)]
*  IRGC troop positions in Iraq have been compromised, it is much more difficult for Iran [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1587.04s)]
*  to create an air of deterrence and restraint around Israel. Okay, now is a better opportunity [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1593.2s)]
*  for Israel to strike Iran, which is why they're doing it, which is why they're doing it right now [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1605.44s)]
*  as opposed to under the Biden administration. Nobody expected these operations to be as successful [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1609.3600000000001s)]
*  as they were, which emboldened Israel on April 1st, 2024, Iran attacked Israel in a massive [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1615.92s)]
*  and unprecedented missile drone strike quietly. The U S military helped defend its number one ally. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1619.68s)]
*  The Arab States looked the other way. The Iranian attack was largely thwarted, which sources tell me [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1624.16s)]
*  came as a surprise to the U S government and further emboldened Israel. Even so Joe Biden [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1627.92s)]
*  didn't want a broader war and risk and the risk it entails. So we kicked the can down the road to [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1632.4s)]
*  Donald Trump. None of this of course began in 2024. Iran and Israel have engaged in a tit for tat [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1637.52s)]
*  shadow war for years with Iran, arming Hamas and other Israeli adversaries. This culminated in [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1641.28s)]
*  October 7 attack, a traumatic event that could not have taken place without Iran's longstanding [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1646.4s)]
*  support and funding that shadow war is what's at the background of all of this, not Iran's [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1651.12s)]
*  nuclear capabilities, the hobby horse of a Washington unwilling to deal with the reality [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1658.16s)]
*  of decades long war and the absence of our own policy for finding peace with Iran. Yes, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1661.84s)]
*  the Iranian administration, the Iranian government, whether they were secular or [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1667.04s)]
*  fundamentalists, it does not matter. As long as the Iranian government is outside of the sphere [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1673.44s)]
*  of American and Israeli control, they will always be a threat. And the American government will [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1678.96s)]
*  always find a way to say these guys are adversaries, they're terrorists, they're bad, they're wrong. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1684.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter because the ultimate goal here is the destabilization of Iran and exchanging [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1690.72s)]
*  leadership of Iran away from an administration that won't play ball with America or is not a [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1696.8s)]
*  willing participant in America's grand design for the region to one that is directly controlled as a [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1708.72s)]
*  puppet state in the hands of the United States of America. That is the ultimate goal here. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1714.32s)]
*  And the WMDs is basically the same. The nukes are the repackaged WMD shit. Just as intervention [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1719.76s)]
*  in Iraq both was fantastic for our material interest, oil, all that stuff, but that [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1731.04s)]
*  destabilization and regime change in Iraq and keeping Iraq as a completely destabilized region [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1739.76s)]
*  that bred incredible militancy in the form of ISIS and numerous other groups [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1747.1200000000001s)]
*  was better overall for Israel's position of dominance in the region. It is not an accident [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1753.52s)]
*  that every single country that is not firmly within the sphere of American and Israeli control and [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1760.24s)]
*  influence has been thwarted. The ultimate goal here isn't even the ultimate goal here [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1766.48s)]
*  isn't even Iran. The ultimate goal here is China. For America's interest in the region, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1774.56s)]
*  Iran is basically the final big bad that won't let them allow, that threatens their overall [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1784.32s)]
*  full-blown control over the region. But the real reason why they want to completely control the [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1795.6799999999998s)]
*  region is because they want to have complete control. They want to have complete control over [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1801.2s)]
*  the energy production or at least almost complete control over the energy production [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1808.4s)]
*  and use that as a incredibly powerful weapon against China. Okay. That's it. The president [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1812.8s)]
*  made it clear that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment. Vice president Vance said today, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1823.2s)]
*  and he said repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways, the easy way or the other way. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1827.04s)]
*  This is about the Strait of Hormuz, right? They could theoretically block it for countries like [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1832.16s)]
*  China. Yes, the Strait of Hormuz where the overwhelming thinkers pass through. It is where [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1835.28s)]
*  the economic engine of the planet, the fuel supply of the entire planet basically goes through. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1844.24s)]
*  And it's not just the Strait of Hormuz. It also is just like oil production in general. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1851.6000000000001s)]
*  If you destabilize Iran, Iran or put a puppet leadership in charge of Iran and turn Iran into [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1857.68s)]
*  like Egypt, for example, a servile state, then all of a sudden, all of a sudden a ginormous country [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1862.48s)]
*  that is aligned with China goes away. It's no longer a threat. You have complete control [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1869.8400000000001s)]
*  over the region. You have complete control over all of the oil that comes out of the region, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1877.04s)]
*  and you can just shut it off. You can shut it off from going to China. Couldn't China just get oil [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1883.0400000000002s)]
*  from Venezuela? Additional complications much further away, not as easily refined as like Saudi [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1892.0s)]
*  oil even. And ultimately it's like this other reason why America wants to also destroy Venezuela [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1898.72s)]
*  as well. Goat questionnaire at the moment. Who isn't, no matter what the dynamic, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1907.2s)]
*  anyway, getting back to this in reality, while the negotiations commenced in secret chambers [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1912.64s)]
*  involving just a handful of principal officials, Trump and his closest advisors talked about [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1917.8400000000001s)]
*  Israel's longstanding plan. A hint to these discussions appear this past weekend when Trump [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1920.8000000000002s)]
*  told the Wall Street Journal that his team had four knowledge of Israel's plans. The lesson Israel [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1924.5600000000002s)]
*  took from 2024 is that Iran might be able to bloody its nose, but not destroy it or the region. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1928.8000000000002s)]
*  Not now. Anyway, Israel also assesses that it's many attacks on Iran's proxies, the emergence of [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1933.92s)]
*  a new Syrian regime, the failure of nuclear talks, and of course, his precise intelligence on Iran's [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1938.16s)]
*  leadership makes this the best moment to act. We now have complete and total control of the skies [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1942.0s)]
*  over Iran. Trump blurted out today, his use of the word, we tell that he is fully behind Israel. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1947.92s)]
*  It will take a while for the military and the bureaucracy and of course, Congress to catch up. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1953.36s)]
*  The news media will be filled with stories about the contradictions of this and that about how [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1956.64s)]
*  close Iran was or wasn't acquiring a nuclear weapon about World War III and how toppling the [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1961.12s)]
*  Iranian regime is just the next Iraq or Libya right up until it happens, whatever it will be. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1964.72s)]
*  Everyone should evacuate to Iran. Trump said on Monday, president Trump has been unusually tight [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1970.64s)]
*  lipped about Israel's military campaign asked Monday about the possibility of regime change. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1975.2800000000002s)]
*  The normally loquacious Trump said simply, I want to see no nuclear weapon in Iran. And we're well [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1978.48s)]
*  on our way to making sure that happens. Press further at the G seven before the president walked [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1984.0s)]
*  out about what he knew. He answered totally out of character that he didn't want to talk about that. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1988.16s)]
*  Israel has not yet officially said that its goal is regime change. I mean, they have, they have it's [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1992.96s)]
*  part of the game as well, but with much of Iran's military leadership eliminated in a lightning fast [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=1998.0s)]
*  series of strikes Friday, Israel's objectives clearly extend beyond just halting their nuclear [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2001.6799999999998s)]
*  program. According to the IDF as of yesterday, Israel struck more than 865 targets, really aim [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2006.48s)]
*  points at targets, not targets themselves. The IDF says 20 plus senior military commanders have [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2013.1999999999998s)]

*  eliminated 120, a third of Iran's force aware of Israel's desire to mount a stronger attack. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2021.1999999999998s)]
*  Trump publicly said he wanted 60 days to negotiate with Iran. I had 60 days and they had 60 days. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2026.32s)]
*  And on the 61st day I said, we don't have a deal. Wall Street journals reporting Iran developing [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2031.28s)]
*  a trigger. Israeli intelligence showed Iran is working on a trigger useful for a nuclear bomb. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2035.76s)]
*  I mean, this could be real. It could be a totally fake phony Israeli propaganda. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2040.08s)]
*  The problem right now is that as events are unfolding, most of the information that you see, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2047.6s)]
*  especially from mainstream media, especially from Israeli outlets are going to be bullshit. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2052.16s)]
*  Okay. This is a funny headline. We can take Trump's word for his word. US State Department says back [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2058.08s)]

*  he wants a real end to the Iran is real conflict. We can take Trump's word for his word. Bruce says, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2066.96s)]
*  but I'm not going to speculate in larger sense on what that would mean. That is up to the president. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2072.0s)]
*  He's the same about what will be occurring from this point forward. Anyway, I'm telling you, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2075.7599999999998s)]
*  this is the, I think this has been the plan for a lot longer. There's only two options out of this. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2081.2s)]
*  Either it's the Trump madman theory, which is how much appetite Iran has for retaliation [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2086.72s)]
*  and how much punishment Iran will dish out to American assets in the region, to Israel in [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2094.8799999999997s)]
*  general. And that calculation is what causes America to either go in full blown or to, I guess, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2100.96s)]
*  simply use this as a threat against Iran and the Iranian population to, I don't know, ultimately [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2111.6s)]
*  get them to a further weakened position where they can be easily thwarted. I do think that no matter [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2119.2s)]
*  what happens, maybe I'm wrong, but I think that no matter what happens, like the goal here is [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2127.92s)]
*  military, a decapitation strike and violent regime change. That's what I think. I might be wrong. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2136.08s)]
*  I hope I'm wrong, but I do think that the goal is to ultimately destabilize Iran and then inevitably [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2144.32s)]
*  down the line, develop new leadership, create new leadership that is servile to American interests [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2151.28s)]
*  in the region. Has this not been the entire plan for a project for a new American century, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2156.96s)]
*  which was Dick Cheney's think tank that spearheaded the Iraq invasion? Yes. Some version of this exact [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2160.48s)]
*  plan has been swirling around in American right-wing, Natsik think tanks in perpetuity. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2165.68s)]
*  I mean, it's happened so many times at this point that I don't know how people don't recognize it [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2173.36s)]
*  when it's unfolding Libya, Syria, Iraq. It's always the same method. It's not like they switch [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2178.08s)]
*  it around. Okay. It's so crazy. I mean, it happened in Iran. Like it's not, this is particularly [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2187.52s)]
*  strange because it happened in Iran already. Okay. This is like, this is not the first time [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2197.52s)]
*  it happened in Iran to a certain degree twice. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp2uH7pvl2E&t=2204.08s)]
