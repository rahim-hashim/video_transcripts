# CNN’s Hostile Interview With Zohran Mamdani | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM)
*  Because what New Yorkers want are results and then it comes to making buses free and universal child care [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=0.0s)]
*  These are things that cost around 700 million dollars and let's say she says soviet union stories. That was she said [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Oh my god, but have to be understood in the context of 113 billion [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=10.96s)]
*  It's better to let people give people a little bit of room to breathe and grow [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=20.72s)]
*  But I also certainly understand why some people don't have that time because there's a fucking genocide going on [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Their view on this of what this means. Okay your victory. What do you think it means? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=29.2s)]
*  I think it means that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=35.84s)]
*  We are ready in the most expensive city in the united states to have five boroughs that new yorkers can actually afford [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=37.52s)]
*  And this entire race was about the question of affordability [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=44.08s)]
*  And ultimately I have run a campaign that speaks about the tools that city government actually has [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=48.64s)]
*  That affordability in the wealthiest city in the wealthiest country in the world and it's time that we have a mayoral administration [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=54.72s)]
*  That follows through and actually delivers that all right [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=60.64s)]
*  So I want to talk about some of that but first the breaking news isa de vera is reporting [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=62.56s)]
*  That andrew cuomo is not dropping out of the general election race, right? And it's kind of a willary wony [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=66.0s)]
*  But the deadline's tomorrow. Is this a surprise to you? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=71.84s)]
*  ultimately [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=75.66s)]
*  Andrew's decision or my decision matters less than the decision that voters already took on tuesday night where we won [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=77.2s)]
*  From bayridge to dyker heights to harlem to washington heights we saw [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=83.52s)]
*  A mandate delivered for a new generation of leadership [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=88.72s)]
*  And I am so proud and excited to continue to build on that mandate with an ever-expanding coalition one that has now [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=92.72s)]
*  included [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=99.28s)]
*  The endorsements of congressman jerry nadler of state senator brad hoylman seagull and manhattan borough president soon-to-be controller mark levine [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=100.32s)]
*  And ultimately that is a coalition that will continue to expand through november, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  So you're saying no matter what names of jewish people zoran. It's not like a redo where you're you're worried [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=110.96s)]
*  No, not at all. I mean we we did it once and it turned out pretty well [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=116.63999999999999s)]
*  All right. So now can we talk about the the the policy the policy is what stood out to a lot of people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=120.16s)]
*  But right I said the freezing the freezing rents on half of the apartments free bus service [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=124.55999999999999s)]
*  The free child care because it's like you have to do that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=130.0s)]
*  How do you pay for that? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=134.0s)]
*  Let's go through it. So for the first thing freezing the rent [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=135.68s)]
*  That's not something that requires any fiscal output from the city [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=138.08s)]
*  It's something that's determined by the rent guidelines board composed of nine members the mayor picks each of those members [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  They determine each year whether rents rise or whether they stay the same the previous mayoral administration froze the rent three times [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=146.24s)]
*  So this has clear historical precedent when it comes to city run even adams you're saying adams. No, this is prior [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=152.72000000000003s)]
*  Okay, he's he's the current one who has raised at nine percent on those same new yorkers pushing them out of their homes [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  City run grocery stores. I proposed a pilot program of one store in each borough [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=162.72000000000003s)]
*  These are five stores in total the total cost of this is 60 million dollars [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=166.72s)]
*  This is less than half the cost of what the city is already set to spend on a subsidy program for corporate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=170.32s)]
*  supermarkets that has no guarantee of cheaper prices or [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=176.06s)]
*  Collective bargaining agreements or even accepting so you're not looking at some like soviet union [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=179.2s)]
*  Grocery stores on every corner that are going to be run by the government [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=185.68s)]
*  No [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=188.16s)]
*  What i'm looking at is how to solve the very clear twin crises of affordability when you go to the grocery store and food deserts [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=188.32s)]
*  Which disproportionately impact black and brown new yorkers across the five boroughs where i've heard directly from new yorkers who say why is it? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=195.2s)]
*  That I can find six fast food restaurants in a five block radius [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=201.44s)]
*  But I can't find a place to buy groceries but five but five boroughs five grocery stores, but that can't be the goal [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean the idea is the goal you want them on every I mean not I mean but in new york things do go [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=209.92s)]
*  There's an alfala on every corner. There's grocery store in almost every other corner [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  I think ultimately i'm guided by outcomes if this pilot succeeds and guaranteeing cheaper groceries as I think it will be then [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=216.88s)]
*  Yes, it should scale up if it doesn't succeed then no it shouldn't because what new yorkers want are results [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=222.56s)]
*  And then it comes to making buses free and universal child care [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=227.28s)]
*  These are things that cost around 700 million dollars and let's say she says soviet union stores. Is that what she said? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=230.88s)]
*  Oh my god, but have to be understood in the context of a 113 billion dollar municipal budget a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  252 billion dollar state budget and we put forward a plan to pay for these [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  And more to start trump proofing our city through two major revenue streams [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  Increasing the top corporate tax rate of new york to match that of new jersey that raises five billion dollars [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=250.64s)]
*  And increasing income taxes on the top one percent of new yorkers who make a million dollars or more a year by two percent [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=254.96s)]
*  Both of these things after they come to fruition you're still paying less than you did before trump. Okay [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=260.0s)]
*  On the city tax though, and I know that takes effect with people right now that top rate of people [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=265.28s)]
*  50,000 or more so if you're going to be adding two percent to people at a million [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=269.5s)]
*  That I just did the math right? Well that but that's going to be an increase of 51 percent of what they pay now [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=273.04s)]
*  It i'm not saying cry for them [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=278.4s)]
*  I'm saying if they leave you're not going to get that money and when you increase someone's taxes by 51 percent [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=279.92s)]
*  Aren't a lot of people going to leave we're saying we're increasing it by two percent of what it is right now and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=285.44s)]
*  Ultimately, i'm guided by the facts the fiscal policy institute did an analysis of the top one percent of new yorkers and found that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=290.32s)]
*  They leave the city at one fourth the rate of other income categories [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=296.24s)]
*  And when they do leave they leave to what are called high tax states new jersey, california [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=300.4s)]
*  So what it then comes down to is why are they leaving is it fiscal policy or is it actually quality of life? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=304.72s)]
*  And i've heard that time and again from wealthier new yorkers from all new yorkers [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  So it's talk this they're going to go to florida and all you think is talking in 2021 when I came to the state assembly [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=311.92s)]
*  We had the same fight to find this is contagious [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=316.8s)]
*  But it's not that bad because i'm used to fucking people being like why are you muslim? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=318.88s)]
*  Why do you want to kill every jude? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=322.8s)]
*  To say this is this is going to be bad and bill ackman billionaire hedge fund manager, of course, you know of him new yorker [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  He said he agrees with you that the city's broken [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=333.52s)]
*  Okay, but he has a real problem with your economic policies [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=336.16s)]
*  He said the ability for new york city to offer services for the poor and needy [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=338.4s)]
*  Let alone the average new yorker is entirely dependent on new york city being a business friendly environment [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=341.92s)]
*  And a place where wealthy residents are willing to spend 183 days the amount you need to be taxed [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=347.2s)]
*  And assume why would you bring up bill as a reasonable? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=352.0s)]
*  Exit orator here. He wrote 40 000 words on twitter that enough is discrediting. That's a big increase [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=356.32s)]
*  That's matching 7.25 going to 11.5 percent and the point of it is that if it works for our regional neighbors [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=363.12s)]
*  And with bill ackman, this is someone who put 500 000 into andrew cuomo super pack [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  Someone to whom clearly money is not an issue and ultimately even for him life would get better [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  Because what i'm looking to use this money for is to make the quality of life across the city [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=379.76000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so when people say democratic socialist, right and i'm curious what you think this means. I mean [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you like capitalism? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=390.56s)]
*  No, I I have many critiques of capitalism and I think ultimately the definition for me of why I call myself a democratic socialist [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=392.72s)]
*  Is the words of dr. King decades ago? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=400.0s)]
*  He said call it democracy or call it democratic socialism [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  There must be a better distribution of wealth for all of god's children in this country [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=405.44000000000005s)]
*  And that's what i'm focused on is dignity and taking on income inequality [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=409.36s)]
*  And for too long politicians have pretended that we're spectators to that crisis of affordability [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  We're actually actors and we have the choice to exacerbate it like mayor adams has done [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  Or to respond to it and resolve it like i'm planning to do open presents that you were the harder get [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=422.74s)]
*  You know for people who say that america was built on and a lot of a lot of immigrants and obviously you speak from an [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=426.82s)]
*  Immigrant experience. I mean you came as a young child [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  But you spoke to speak to a lot of people who came much more recently that they come to america because they believe in capitalism [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=433.7s)]
*  They believe that if they work hard and make a lot of money that that's part of the american dream [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=440.42s)]
*  Do you think that's not part of the american dream? I think the dream at its core is a dream for [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=445.3s)]
*  stability in one's life and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=450.72s)]
*  What you're saying that you work hard enough and that you then reap the benefits [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=452.98s)]
*  Too many new yorkers and americans for that matter are working eight hours and then still feeling like they haven't made enough money to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=456.98s)]
*  Keep living in the city [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  They call home and ultimately what i'm focused on is making the city affordable for everyone [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=463.78000000000003s)]
*  Not to win an ideological argument, but to deliver on the mandate of this one mayor adams [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=469.06s)]
*  You just heard him come out and he said uh [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=472.74s)]
*  Soup silver spoon. He talked about manicured nails to refer to you [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=475.22s)]
*  Right. You were I was looking at him. You can show everybody [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  What do you say to him? You know, I understand what he's doing. He's trying to distract from his own record [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=483.86s)]
*  His is a record where he raised rents on more than two million new yorkers by nine percent [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=489.06s)]
*  And he's considering another eight percent increase his is a record of raising the water bill to the highest it's been in 13 years [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=492.98s)]
*  Supporting con Edison when they wanted to increase new yorkers gas and electric bills by 65 dollars a month [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=497.78s)]
*  I would much rather talk about me than I would about his record if I was him [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=502.65999999999997s)]
*  And so that's what he's going to be doing over the next few months and we will continue to remind new yorkers [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=506.97999999999996s)]

*  Our conversation was zoran mumdani continues right after this [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=514.1s)]
*  Because the truth is his rise in the democratic party has been meteoric and tonight ice director [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=517.62s)]
*  Tom homin is weighing in on mumdani's win somebody that mumdani has confronted [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=522.58s)]
*  I [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=528.26s)]
*  Think aaron bernett is a hostile entity here for the record live [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=529.46s)]
*  I think aaron bernett is is hostile like straight up. Do you think some of these interviewers are starting to like him? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter. They're paid not to okay [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=540.58s)]
*  They're paid not to but yeah, like I said, I sure i'm sure the israel questions are are certainly going to come up [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=544.26s)]
*  um, hopefully they'll [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=550.0200000000001s)]
*  maybe maybe [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=552.0200000000001s)]
*  Package it with like some islamophobic attacks that he's been been receiving but yeah, even like well americans love capitalism [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=554.18s)]
*  Well, it seems like capitalism isn't working. You know, this is not even if this is not even an assessment about capitalism or socialism [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=562.26s)]
*  People want affordability. It doesn't matter what you want to call it. No shit [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=569.54s)]
*  Her husband is david rubelota used to be a managing director of city group [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=573.62s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I know I know [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=577.86s)]
*  Should lefty folks take appraisal from trump and just start shit talking the media there isn't enough there isn't a big enough media ecosystem [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=581.22s)]
*  And also trump didn't shit talk the media. He loves fox news. There is a faucet [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=588.98s)]
*  There is a faucet of support coming from fox news. There is no fox news equivalent for the socialist left [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=595.86s)]
*  So you have to play a tightrope. It's not bad to shit on the media [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=601.54s)]
*  It certainly isn't bad to shit on the media. I do it all the time [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=605.54s)]
*  And yet when you become undeniable when you become a large enough force, even if you shit talk the media [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=609.06s)]
*  Even if you shit talk the media, they will still come to you and be like, why are you so successful? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=616.58s)]
*  Isn't it you? No, that's my point. I'm not I i'm not fox news. I'm nowhere near as powerful as fox news me [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=621.22s)]
*  choppo [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=629.28s)]
*  democracy now and majority report combined does not touch fox like all of us combined still [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=630.72s)]
*  Do not make up for the same audience that fox news does [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=637.94s)]
*  And also you have to remember there's independent media on top of fox news that trump can rely on do you get what i'm saying like [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=641.78s)]
*  we are the independent faction and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=648.9s)]
*  clearly, especially with the zoran stuff like [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=651.7s)]
*  It i've i've been thinking about it differently. Um [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=654.98s)]
*  like in the past if you were to ask me like, uh, how much influence we have [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=659.14s)]
*  You know myself and other like independent left outlets like how much influence we have [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=662.9s)]
*  I would have told you it's it's marginal. It's meaningless [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=667.86s)]
*  but I will say [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=670.74s)]
*  I will say [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=672.58s)]
*  that uh [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=674.74s)]
*  Like not directly getting the word out on zoran, but instead having the type of audiences that we have [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=676.02s)]
*  Having the type of audiences that we have that are [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=684.1s)]
*  incredibly active [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=687.2s)]
*  organizers door knockers members of the dsa members of psl [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=689.2s)]
*  Um that actually can help a campaign, uh [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=694.82s)]
*  That already has all of the other has all of the other [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=698.34s)]
*  uh [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=702.26s)]
*  Facets that you need to be successful that can clearly help a campaign like that [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=703.86s)]
*  uh thrive [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=710.1s)]
*  For sure, but it has to be organic [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=712.26s)]
*  Like with zoran it was it was a perfect storm [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=715.14s)]
*  all of the different [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=719.38s)]
*  Uh, all of the different puzzle pieces fell right into the appropriate places. He's a guy who? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=721.06s)]
*  Worked in state politics. He's charismatic [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=727.4599999999999s)]
*  He has the same opinions that that we do and also on top of that [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=730.3399999999999s)]
*  He's a great primary for new york city [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=734.3399999999999s)]
*  over [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=736.7399999999999s)]
*  Andrew cuomo for next city mayor before we continue the conversation. I just want to play because that's what this is play [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=737.54s)]
*  More of mamdani telling his story [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=744.3399999999999s)]
*  So to quote the words of a famous new yorker, this is my favorite allow me to reintroduce myself [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=747.3000000000001s)]
*  Not this part. I was born in campala, uganda in east africa [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=753.46s)]
*  I was given my middle name cuome by my father who named me after the first prime minister of gana [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=757.94s)]
*  I moved to this city when I was seven [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=762.82s)]
*  This is the city I fell in love with the city where I got my citizenship [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=764.82s)]
*  I wish I wish they showed the rest of that speech. He's been in the new york assembly for four years [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=767.94s)]
*  And before that he was an aspiring rapper under the name mr. Cardamom listen [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=772.4200000000001s)]
*  Once you do it it's out there it never comes back it's there didn't think it was going to be on cnn [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=792.74s)]
*  It's there and there it is. Um, so what do you say to people who look at your background and they wonder? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=797.3000000000001s)]
*  They say okay [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=802.34s)]
*  Rising star you may be [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=804.02s)]
*  But this is the largest city in america 112 billion dollar budget eight million people and a hell of a lot of problems [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=805.94s)]
*  And they say what is that? Okay, whatever the future may be you're not ready now [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=812.5s)]
*  I would say that a campaign offers a glimpse of what an administration would look like [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=816.4200000000001s)]
*  And we built a campaign the likes of which the city has not seen in a long time [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=820.5s)]
*  We started with two full-time employees. Oh my gosh [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=824.1s)]
*  She's at the present as an unserious immigrant years at the beginning of this race [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=826.42s)]
*  There were questions of whether we'd get 50 000 votes [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=830.3399999999999s)]
*  What we had 50 000 50 000 volunteers who knocked on 1.5 million doors made [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=833.06s)]
*  2.1 million phone calls and ultimately it's a story of not only being able to inspire people but [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=839.12s)]
*  Absorb that inspiration and build an organization [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=844.66s)]
*  And I think that's also the story of what it means to run a city that you are ultimately responsible [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=847.54s)]
*  But you're also determined by hiring the best and the brightest and that's what I will be doing in city hall [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=852.34s)]
*  clear track record of excellence of results that come from a wide variety of mayoral administrations and [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=856.98s)]
*  Finally bring public excellence back into the public sector. All right, so you caught a lot of attention for confronting tom homan [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=862.4s)]
*  Trump's borders are about the deportation policies which have a lot of impact here in new york. Here you are [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=869.9399999999999s)]
*  Tom [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=882.02s)]
*  So that moment went viral all right then after the primary homin was asked about your plan [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=884.66s)]
*  Which is on your website [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=889.38s)]
*  You said that you would end the city's cooperation with ice agents that has been going on under mayor adams and he has [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=890.34s)]
*  Spoken out. Here's what he said [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=896.5s)]
*  Good luck with that [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=900.1s)]
*  Governor law trumps him every every every every day every hour of every minute. We're going to be in new york city game on [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=901.62s)]
*  We're coming [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=908.34s)]
*  Game on he's coming. What do you say that i'm going to be here to stand up and fight back and unlike the current mayor [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=911.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to be working alongside the trump administration to build the single largest deportation force in american history [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=916.82s)]
*  I'm going to actually represent each and every new yorker and that includes immigrant new yorkers [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=922.26s)]
*  And that means standing up for the laws of the city like our sanctuary city policies [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=926.5s)]
*  Which have kept new yorkers safe for decades and were defended by republicans and democrats alike for years until we got this mayor [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=930.02s)]
*  Who fear mongered about them so extensively does that involve the nypd? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=935.86s)]
*  It means that the nypd would actually serve new yorkers and not assist ice in their operations. We recently saw ice agents [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=939.22s)]
*  So they would not assist ice not assisting ice because ultimately their job is public safety [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=946.02s)]
*  And I know officers were signing up to take on serious crimes not [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=950.34s)]
*  To be a part of the force that is arresting a pastor who's peacefully observing the arrest of a migrant at federal plaza [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=953.78s)]
*  All right [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=959.54s)]
*  So a moment ago you talked about how you didn't know if you'd get 50 000 votes and you ended up with 50 000 volunteers [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=959.86s)]
*  They knocked on doors [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=965.54s)]
*  There are many in the country who might look at that and say okay that makes me think of somebody else somebody else who took on [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=966.9s)]
*  a I i'm trying to think of the right word to use but somebody who expected to win [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=972.98s)]
*  And therefore didn't campaign that hard and lost and the person who did that was alexandre ocasio cortez, right? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=976.98s)]
*  Famously also here in new york. She endorsed you early. She helped you [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=982.96s)]
*  She just spoke to manu raju. I are manu raju a few moments ago [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=987.14s)]
*  She said the democratic party needs to pay attention to your success right now. Here's what she just told him [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=990.42s)]
*  We have a choice to listen to that message that [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=996.34s)]
*  People are sending us or not. This isn't just about uh, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1001.06s)]
*  Mr. Mamdani as an individual. This is about the message that the people of new york city are trying to send to our party [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1005.54s)]
*  So there's now talk, you know that her your victory [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1013.06s)]
*  Puts her in a whole new light [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1016.02s)]
*  Right. It puts her in bernie sanders not that they were seen as fringe [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1017.62s)]
*  But they were seen as a wing of the party and that instead of being a wing [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1020.02s)]
*  That becomes more of the center and that you are part of that [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1022.98s)]
*  Do you see it that way and do you see those who say look your victory propels her to a presidential run? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1026.1s)]
*  She's been an inspiration and it's been an honor to be represented by her as an assembly member in estoria for many years [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1033.22s)]
*  and I think about a [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1039.3799999999999s)]
*  Senior who works at the child care center that I met in sunny side queens who told me that i'm not a progressive [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1041.3s)]
*  But I realized when I looked at alexandre ocasio cortez and bernie sanders [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1046.58s)]
*  They were the only ones who were willing to fight for me [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1050.18s)]
*  And that's what so many new yorkers and americans understand is that [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1052.66s)]
*  These are the two individuals who have been willing to take on this oligarchy and actually stand up for dignity for americans [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1055.78s)]
*  Before you go one last thing bill ackman. I just mentioned him as as [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1061.7s)]
*  There are a lot like him whether it's ken griffin or ceo's of big banks [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1066.1s)]
*  Would you meet with them? I'll meet with anyone [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1070.66s)]
*  I will meet with them and i'll explain why I believe in the necessity of raising the top corporate tax rate [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1073.1399999999999s)]
*  And i'd also tell bill ackman that I firmly disagree with his attempt to dismantle diversity equity and inclusion across the country [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1077.94s)]
*  Because it's not only against the morals of so many it's also against the actual bottom line for so many businesses [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1083.94s)]
*  And as a businessman he should understand that all right. Well assemblyman. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1089.06s)]
*  Obviously right now center of discussion [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1094.26s)]
*  In the democratic party and tomorrow on cnn new york city mayor eric adams will be on the lead with jake tapper [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1096.66s)]
*  That will be at five o'clock [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1101.94s)]
*  And next we take you to venice [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1103.86s)]
*  Okay, uh gotta gotta talk about something here that actually pertains to uh, also no israel mention which was crazy [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1106.34s)]
*  um [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1114.34s)]
*  It's not the worst that was not the worst interview. Uh, I will say making it for jake tapper's interview. Yeah [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1116.1799999999998s)]
*  so one of the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1122.1799999999998s)]
*  One of the pieces of discussion here [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1124.74s)]
*  Is one how impossible it is for zoran to accomplish his policies? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1127.6999999999998s)]
*  And maybe even how scary it is i'm going to talk about brad lander and and jake tapper in a second [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1133.8600000000001s)]
*  But I want to make a point clear here [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1138.42s)]
*  Okay, when zoran is when when the when the assessments are coming in from the commentary about zoran [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1141.22s)]
*  A big thing that a lot of people in mainstream outlets are focusing on is oh he uses social media [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1148.8200000000002s)]
*  He used so much social media. It's cute. It's fascinating. He worked really hard. He worked really hard. He was really stubborn [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1153.6200000000001s)]
*  Right. He's handsome. He's attractive. He's charismatic [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1159.46s)]
*  and a lot of that [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1162.44s)]
*  Moves away from the actual policies and the only time when he when they actually talk about his messaging discipline and his policies [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1164.36s)]
*  Is when they're talking about how scary? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1171.6399999999999s)]
*  the implementation of said policies would look like or how impossible it is [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1174.52s)]
*  to actually push for these policies [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1179.32s)]
*  and I [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1182.04s)]
*  obviously, uh [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1183.96s)]
*  Have experienced something similar in my world as a political commentator [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1186.76s)]
*  whenever i've gotten these, uh [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1192.52s)]
*  These articles these puff pieces written or any sort of like analysis about why i'm so successful [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1196.3600000000001s)]
*  right [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1202.3600000000001s)]
*  Especially because uh in the immediate aftermath of the democrat defeat [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1203.32s)]
*  Democrats were desperately looking for you know, how [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1208.76s)]
*  The republicans won and a part of that autopsy was [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1212.44s)]
*  To find like the dro-rogan of the left and people kept pointing to me and saying you're the dro-rogan of the left [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1215.8s)]
*  you're the dro-rogan of the left and [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1221.72s)]
*  and [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1224.6s)]
*  all of those [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1225.6399999999999s)]
*  All of those puff pieces and those profiles and all of that analysis [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1227.6399999999999s)]
*  Often primarily focused on the way I look and the way I carry myself [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1232.76s)]
*  The policies that I advocate for my belief system the things that I talk about was always secondary [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1238.12s)]
*  I'm I'm beginning to realize [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1245.32s)]
*  that [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1248.6s)]
*  This might be deliberate because at first I thought oh no, this is just like a more approachable way to talk about this thing [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1250.12s)]
*  That it's just like the aesthetics because i'm not saying that your aesthetics and the way you carry yourself don't matter [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1257.3999999999999s)]
*  They of course matter [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1262.92s)]
*  Of course they do [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1264.52s)]
*  Zoran's charm his charisma his looks certainly play a role in this for sure [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1266.6s)]
*  but what a lot of people in the liberal side [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1273.0s)]
*  a lot of people in mainstream media fail to understand [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1277.32s)]
*  Or are deliberately avoiding talking about is that these are policies that are popular because [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1280.92s)]
*  This is what I kept [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1287.6399999999999s)]
*  Talking about anytime someone would come to me with what did the democrats do wrong? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1290.28s)]
*  I kept reiterating that it was actually not a a a [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1296.52s)]
*  messaging gap or a [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1302.28s)]
*  Outlet that they didn't go to even though that certainly played a role in this [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1305.48s)]
*  But it was more so that the messages that were being put out [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1309.96s)]
*  Were not being received positively by the population and the example I always used [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1314.92s)]
*  was [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1319.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris unveiling [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1320.76s)]
*  Her comprehensive package right what she thinks [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1323.32s)]
*  She's going to run on [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1327.8799999999999s)]
*  And there was nothing definable there. There was nothing that was tangible. There was nothing that you could like associate with [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1329.96s)]
*  uh an immediate solution to an immediate problem [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1336.52s)]
*  That americans were broadly experiencing [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1341.48s)]
*  as a matter of fact, the only good policy that she came out with right out of the gate was [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1345.16s)]
*  to to uh [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1349.32s)]
*  Tackle price gougers right to go after price gougers [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1351.48s)]
*  And she dropped that very quickly. Okay, and I kept reiterating this point that it's [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwhkLJ8hcM&t=1356.36s)]
