**HasanAbi:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc)
*  I don't care. I don't care. What are they going to do about it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=0.0s)]
*  We America says yes, but more. Okay. Ha ha. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=3.36s)]
*  Babies, babies of babies of the whole. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  We are them. We are the babies of the whole. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=11.72s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=16.28s)]
*  Our Hezbollah targets in Lebanon after several rockets were fired from Lebanon [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=23.28s)]
*  into Israel. ABC's Matt Rivers is there in Tel Aviv with the latest overnight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=27.44s)]
*  Good morning, Matt. And Israel is also sending more troops into Gaza. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=31.64s)]
*  That tense 24 hours here across the region, Israelis starting their work week [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=36.68s)]
*  with sirens as a missile launched from Yemen set off alert systems. Oh man, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=41.32s)]
*  they have valid security concerns again in southern Lebanon. That's crazy [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=46.36s)]
*  across the country. The IDF intercepting it though, before it arrived. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=50.44s)]
*  This is the IDF says it is once again expanding the presence of ground troops [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=54.4s)]
*  in Gaza, ordering new evacuations as more and more troops retake parts of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=58.68s)]
*  Gaza. People now forced to pick up and move once again with no real safe place [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=63.24s)]
*  to go. It is a broad operation that has moved a lot faster than many were [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=68.24s)]
*  expecting, and it has left a lot of people. The death toll, according to the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=71.84s)]
*  Gaza Health Ministry, well over 600 just since Tuesday, including at least 180 [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=75.72s)]
*  Children, says UNICEF. And today, health officials saying the death toll since [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=82.04s)]
*  the began now more than 50,000 people and at the northern border with Israel [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=85.88s)]
*  projectiles launched from southern Lebanon for the first time since the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=91.2s)]
*  ceasefire brokered last year between Hezbollah and Israel, none doing any [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  damage. Israel responding with massive airstrikes at least seven people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=99.12s)]
*  Hezbollah, though denying that they fired the projectiles in Israeli [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=103.76s)]
*  official also saying they're not sure which group is responsible, but the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=107.4s)]
*  threat of escalation, which certainly now higher after this ceasefire had [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=110.64s)]
*  largely held up for months with the whole region on edge. Matt Rivers for us. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=114.8s)]
*  Thank you. Israel's basically ripped up the ceasefire agreement that was signed [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=119.52s)]
*  that was put by the by the Americans that envisage going to the second phase [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  of the ceasefire negotiating. What have you been doing for the last three weeks? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=129.56s)]
*  We're not negotiating. We were meant to start a long time ago, and the Israeli [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=133.72s)]
*  team never went out. Absolutely. No. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  It's awesome. Just like. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=143.48s)]
*  Lying is OP everywhere, baby, not just not just in Turkey, not just in America, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=146.4s)]
*  certainly in Israel as well. Lying is always and forever overpowered. Lying is [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=152.68s)]
*  OP. Please nerf. Just the argument is always just nah, nah. Like everybody [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=157.88s)]
*  knows this is the case, except for Americans, because Americans don't [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=163.96s)]
*  actually, you know, get to hear real truthful information about what's going [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=167.16s)]
*  on in Israel. People in Israel know this is the case. They know this is the case [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=172.96s)]
*  and either they like it because they like what Nenny I was doing or their [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=176.8s)]
*  furthest the right than any how and they like that. He's like ripping it up or [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=180.56s)]
*  they hate it and they protest against it because they're like, I don't have an [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=185.16s)]
*  issue with like Gaza, but I want my family members to, you know, be [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=188.68s)]
*  extracted. So very strange stuff in this day and age where I feel like 95% of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=191.96s)]
*  what I talk about is just me constantly going, this is just objectively untrue. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  Like what this government official insert government official from anywhere. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  OK, what this government official is saying is just undeniably incorrect. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=211.44s)]
*  It's just a lie. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=219.04s)]
*  Washington to sit with Witkoff and with trial work that will actually talk [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  about what Israel needs are. And that's very important because at the end of the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=224.92s)]
*  day, we have to bring back the security and the safety of our children. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=229.6s)]
*  Netanyahu has his own priorities. It looks as if the hostages are not the top [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=232.84s)]
*  of his priorities. And this is why things are not being done the way the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  majority of Israelis would have wanted it to be done. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=244.68s)]
*  Most of the hostage families are against presuming that most of the Israeli [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=248.2s)]
*  public is against presuming that. Why is your government doing it? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=251.28s)]
*  None of the so-called facts you just stated are correct. Some families are [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=254.88s)]
*  against. I don't judge the families. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=259.12s)]
*  Yeah, they're the pussy families. They just they are selfish. They want they [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=262.68s)]
*  do not want against babies to continue. So-called facts. None of your so-called [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=269.84s)]
*  facts are correct. No, this is not the UN drawing. This is a different guy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  We have been trying for the past three weeks sort of negotiation with Hamas. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=280.12s)]
*  It's understood that they're not going to release hostages without staying in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=285.44s)]
*  Gaza. Staying in Gaza is not something we are willing to let them do. Therefore, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=289.68s)]
*  there is no other way. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=294.68s)]
*  You 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, you've destroyed most much of the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=295.6s)]
*  If that hasn't been enough to eliminate and destroy Hamas, what on earth makes [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=301.92s)]
*  you think it's possible to achieve militarily now? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=305.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's because you can't eliminate an idea. It's not Hamas. You want the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian people. You cannot an entire people's need for emancipation. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=315.32s)]
*  That's the problem. It doesn't have to be Hamas. You can call it anything else. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=325.12s)]
*  Okay. That guy's a sexual assaulter by the way. And in a religious cult, I mean, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=329.84s)]
*  yeah, the religious cult is the Likud party. A baby's a Likudnik. Yeah. Just [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=335.92s)]
*  common Likud member of the Knesset. Just Likud things. These guys are, these [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=342.2s)]
*  guys are the center, right? And Israel, by the way, that's the fantastic, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=348.56s)]
*  fantastic country. It's really cool. It's so funny. Also, when I talk about this [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=353.4s)]
*  shit, people are like, wow, this is really anti-Semitic of you. It's like, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=358.44s)]
*  dude, I say the exact same shit about American politics too. We have our own [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=361.44s)]
*  version of this shit happening in the United States of America as well. It's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=364.68s)]
*  just like, it's identical because Israel is attached to the hip to the United [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=368.08s)]
*  States of America. It's basically, you know, America's vestige. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=373.48s)]
*  There's an American plan, plan of President Trump saying, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=378.88s)]
*  Which is by the Klausens and the Arab state. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=384.36s)]
*  I don't care. I care about this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=386.36s)]
*  I don't care. I don't care. What are they going to do about it? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=388.4s)]
*  We, America says yes, one more. Okay. Ha ha. Babies of terror. Babies of terror. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  We are killing them. We are killing the babies of terror. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=399.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=404.12s)]
*  Israeli interests. I don't care about Gaza. I don't care the interests about [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=404.8s)]
*  people in London. I care about my family. I care about my people that were [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=408.12s)]
*  butchered, slaughtered and raped here not too long ago. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=413.12s)]
*  It has been proven that only military pressure brings a good deal. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=416.64s)]
*  A year and a half of very intense war with a lot of civilian casualties in Gaza [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=421.24s)]
*  shows that it's not possible to militarily alone defeat Hamas. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=426.68s)]
*  A year and a half under the Biden administration that forced us to fight [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=430.64s)]
*  Hamas with one hand. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=437.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's kind of crazy, by the way, I was having a conversation with someone. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=438.76s)]
*  I was having a conversation with someone last night where I said the Palestinian [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=442.72s)]
*  literacy rate in the West Bank in Gaza is higher than the Israeli literacy rate. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=447.72s)]
*  And he just would not believe me. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=453.68s)]
*  I was like, look it up, man, just Google it like it's available. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=457.16s)]
*  People don't people can't believe it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, it's like one of my favorite, one of my favorite facts to pull [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=463.96000000000004s)]
*  when talking to white supremacists, when debating or arguing with like a racist [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=472.12s)]
*  person is to tell them that the highest educated population, like ethnic group in [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=476.12s)]
*  the United States of America are Nigerians. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=481.8s)]
*  They can't comprehend it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  Right. There's a material reason for it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=485.72s)]
*  But like they don't even want to scratch that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=488.0s)]
*  They don't even want to scratch the surface where they go. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=490.12s)]
*  No, that's not the case, because no, no way. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=492.6s)]
*  It's true. They and people get so mad. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=496.56s)]
*  People get so mad about that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's the same. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=501.48s)]
*  It's the same thing here. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  People don't want to believe it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=504.52000000000004s)]
*  They're like, I don't agree with you on the statement. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=505.68s)]
*  The Palestinian literacy rate for adults across the board is ninety seven point eight is [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  ninety eight percent. The Israeli literacy rate is ninety two percent. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=517.0s)]
*  OK. But when I have this conversation with someone where I tell them that they're like, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  there's just no way there's just no fucking way. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=527.08s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=529.84s)]
*  What leads you to believe that that is, you know, how can you object to a fact? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=530.8s)]

*  I mean, it's the truth. What do you mean? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=538.88s)]
*  Getting clipped out of context. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=540.56s)]
*  I think broadly one of the biggest issues nowadays, one of the biggest issues nowadays [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=542.24s)]
*  is the fact that people just want to operate on vibes. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=550.96s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=556.28s)]
*  OK. Yeah, it's because of the Hara, the demon isolated communities. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=558.76s)]
*  Yes, that is part of the reason. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  Nice trivia. But what does that have to do with anything? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=565.8s)]
*  The broader point that I'm making. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=567.8s)]
*  Listen to the point I'm making, which is that people by and large and educated people as [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=569.24s)]
*  well, like well-educated people would rather confirm their biases than actually seek out [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=576.12s)]
*  the truth. And it is one of the most frustrating things that I encounter on a daily basis as [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=583.5999999999999s)]
*  a political commentator. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=590.1199999999999s)]
*  It is incredibly frustrating. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=591.68s)]
*  It is incredibly annoying. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=594.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think it's alarming. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=597.5999999999999s)]
*  Like, we have gotten worse at this. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=599.16s)]
*  We've gotten worse at, like, critically examining things and and and having an overall [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=602.52s)]
*  healthy hunger for the truth. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=609.8s)]
*  We don't have it anymore. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=611.52s)]
*  It is really, really shitty. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=612.7199999999999s)]
*  And perhaps the reason why, especially in the United States of America, why we have [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=615.7199999999999s)]
*  this issue is because of this. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=622.56s)]
*  The Israeli literacy rate for adults is 92 percent. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=630.64s)]
*  The Palestinian literacy rate for adults is 98 percent. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=634.1199999999999s)]
*  The American literacy rate for adults is 79 percent. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=637.64s)]
*  But to feed them with the other. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=643.92s)]
*  So I can tell you that now the war is going to be handled in a totally different way with [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=645.84s)]
*  the Trump administration, with the backing of America. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=650.36s)]
*  Trump himself said numerous times that all hell should break on Gaza if they're not [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=652.6800000000001s)]
*  bringing back all hostages. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=658.84s)]
*  What does unleashing hell look like? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=660.32s)]
*  I mean, you've already seen under, as you say, the Biden administration, daily death [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=661.8s)]
*  tolls of around three, four hundred people a day. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=665.76s)]
*  You will see exactly what it means. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=668.0s)]
*  This terrorist organization, it's not just holding. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=670.24s)]
*  I mean, if it still holds civilian power within a couple of months, it can regroup [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=672.92s)]
*  another group and recruit more terrorists and form a more powerful army to fight us. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=680.36s)]
*  So we don't we can't just fight it from a military perspective, but also from a civilian [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=687.08s)]
*  point of view and dismantle their civilian power. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=692.0s)]
*  Do you think it is possible to militarily defeat Hamas, dismantle its civilian [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=694.96s)]
*  infrastructure? Do you think that is possible? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=698.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=700.6s)]
*  I mean, but how many more lives is that going to take of Palestinians as well? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=701.2800000000001s)]
*  It can be with zero lives if Hamas tomorrow take down their arm and surrender and bring [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=705.76s)]
*  back our hostages. Zero. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=712.44s)]
*  We're dealing with a terrorist organization and as much as they're sacrificing and hate [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=714.52s)]
*  the Jews and wants to completely obliterate us and our communities, they don't care for [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=721.5200000000001s)]
*  the lives of Palestinians either. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=727.36s)]
*  That responsibility is on the hands of Hamas and Hamas only. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=729.4000000000001s)]
*  Are you comfortable with 400 people being killed today? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=734.0s)]
*  500 people? Is that that? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=736.44s)]
*  You don't want to hear the answer from her. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=738.7600000000001s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=741.72s)]
*  Actually, the answer is no. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=743.8800000000001s)]
*  She's like, I want it to be a thousand people killed today. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=745.2s)]
*  I think that we're not killing enough children. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  We are simply not killing enough children, enough terror babies. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=749.88s)]
*  Something that you're willing to count on is going forward to try and destroy Hamas. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=753.64s)]
*  This equivalence is absolutely absurd. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=759.32s)]
*  You think I like that? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=762.44s)]
*  Oh, oh, you hate it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=764.76s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=766.32s)]

*  You know. Oh, how dare you? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=773.76s)]
*  How dare you suggest that I enjoy. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=776.6800000000001s)]
*  The sites of of baby murder. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=781.76s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=785.12s)]
*  I mean, we just it's it's really it's really horrible that we have to do these things. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=786.36s)]
*  We have to kill as many babies as possible. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=791.0400000000001s)]
*  How dare you? I mean, you guys know the reason why I say this, by the way, the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=794.72s)]
*  the median age in 2020 in Gaza, I don't even know what the latest [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=802.0s)]
*  stats on this looks like, but the median age in 2020 in Gaza was 18. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=805.36s)]
*  OK, 40 percent of the Gaza population is 14 year olds or younger. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=809.24s)]
*  They're killing children mostly. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=814.72s)]
*  There is a reason why when you look at the stats. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=817.4s)]
*  When you look at the actual stats of like who they're killing, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=821.36s)]
*  whenever they bomb something, it's like mostly kids and women and the elderly. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=824.28s)]
*  Close to 80 percent. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=828.4s)]
*  It's it. Yeah. Our greatest ally. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=829.84s)]
*  Here it is. Israel recently committed. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=831.88s)]
*  The largest child massacre in its history, 200 children [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=834.52s)]
*  and 100 women were killed in one day altogether. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=838.08s)]
*  About 400 civilians were killed. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=840.88s)]
*  And the number of the dead is not yet final. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  These numbers are not reported in the Israeli media. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=844.48s)]
*  And if they are, it's always minimized in an outrageous manner. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=846.28s)]
*  The only time you hear these numbers get reported in Israeli media, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  as a matter of fact, this also not true. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=852.24s)]
*  What do you call it? Haritz did report on it, like literally use that term. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=855.48s)]
*  I think this might actually be a Haritz article, as a matter of fact. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=859.48s)]
*  But the only other channel that I saw in Israel report on the numbers [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=863.0s)]
*  was I think it was like Channel 14 or something like one of those fucking [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=868.3199999999999s)]

*  That's the crazy hypocrisy of Israeli media, which is that [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=884.36s)]
*  Israeli media will literally use the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=888.84s)]
*  Hamas backed Palestinian Health Ministry numbers [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=892.1999999999999s)]

*  But they'll just say all of the people that we killed were terrorists. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=898.64s)]
*  Do they even have free press? No, they don't. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=901.88s)]

*  Israel took over the Turkish Gaza Friendship Hospital, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1002.32s)]
*  which was the only cancer ward in Gaza. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1007.28s)]
*  They overtook it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1010.16s)]
*  They used it as a military station. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1011.4s)]
*  And yesterday they blew it up after they were done with it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1013.48s)]
*  And they said, well, no one can use the hospital anyway, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1017.76s)]
*  because we had overtaken it militarily. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1021.24s)]
*  When I began my conversion process, still going the first and most important [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1023.64s)]
*  lesson I learned from diaspora and especially people who lived in Israel [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1026.56s)]
*  was that the government always lies. That's just the standard. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1029.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, every government lies. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1031.56s)]
*  Every government lies, of course, of course, governments lie. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1034.84s)]
*  The Chinese government lies, the American government lies, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1038.48s)]
*  the Turkish government lies, every government lies. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1040.8s)]
*  The Israeli government lies all the time as well. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1042.52s)]
*  Just simply calling that out is not anti-Semitic. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1045.36s)]
*  I would say that [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1049.4399999999998s)]
*  the Israeli government, on the other hand, lies in the most egregious ways possible [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1051.4399999999998s)]
*  and the most like like easily identifiably wrong ways possible. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1055.1999999999998s)]
*  That's the major difference, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1060.76s)]
*  because there is no opposition in the Western world to the Israeli government's lies. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1062.28s)]
*  They just never counter it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  There are more critical reporting against the Israeli government in Israel [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1067.56s)]
*  than the United States of America. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1073.2s)]
*  Our mainstream press is always running defense for Israel [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1075.08s)]
*  in ways that are more egregious than Israeli outlets. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1078.76s)]
*  Israeli Zionist leftist media person Guy Maroz [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1085.52s)]
*  last night on Channel 14's talk show, hopped through a team. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1088.24s)]
*  Now we need to focus on one thing only to stop the war, to bring back hostages. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1091.36s)]
*  And then as far as I'm concerned, then he Netanyahu can destroy all of Gaza. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1094.24s)]
*  Oh, wow. I love that. Wonderful. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1098.0s)]
*  Wonderful Israeli leftist here. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1101.56s)]
*  No, the only Israeli leftists are the the guys like Dr. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1104.0s)]
*  Ofer Kasif, the Mezar vote, people that are conscientious objectors. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1107.36s)]
*  Dip shits like this, like liberal Zionists like this [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1112.24s)]
*  also want death and destruction upon the entirety of the Palestinian people. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1115.56s)]
*  They're not fucking real. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1120.2s)]
*  That's why I say liberal Zionists are like saying you're a liberal fucking Nazi. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1121.32s)]
*  Zionism is a Nazi ideology. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1125.96s)]
*  OK, it is identical to Nazi ideology. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1129.56s)]
*  It's an exterminationist ideology. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1132.0800000000002s)]
*  It's one that is born out of an ethno religious supremacist [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1134.0s)]
*  settler colonial state. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1138.0800000000002s)]
*  It is there to justify the existence of an ethno religious supremacist [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1139.96s)]
*  settler colonial state that is currently an apartheid [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1144.52s)]
*  and also currently doing a genocide. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1148.0s)]
*  OK. This is why saying someone is like a liberal in Israel [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1151.84s)]
*  and still a Zionist is like saying someone is a fucking liberal Nazi. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1157.9599999999998s)]
*  Isn't what you said all illegal under that anti-Semitism bill? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1167.7199999999998s)]

*  You cannot. You can try to hide the truth. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1182.2s)]
*  You can try to shelter people from the truth. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1186.68s)]
*  You can turn around and and lie to the best of your ability. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1189.4s)]
*  You can make it impossible. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1194.88s)]
*  You can try to prosecute people for saying the truth. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1196.2s)]
*  But you know what the reality is? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1198.92s)]
*  The truth still remains. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1202.08s)]
*  This is the truth. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1204.48s)]
*  It does not matter. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1206.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter what you do. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1208.2s)]
*  You just simply cannot change the truth. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1209.8s)]
*  And now we need to focus only on one thing. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1213.0s)]
*  Not on the right-wing side, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1215.52s)]
*  and not on the right-wing side, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1217.52s)]
*  sorry, I'm not good at saying this, but it's interesting. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1219.52s)]
*  Focus only on how, apparently, the only way, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1222.0s)]
*  to stop the war, to bring the [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1225.28s)]
*  Great idea is called ending the occupation. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1242.48s)]

*  So what happens when people don't want to leave? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1498.24s)]
*  You keep saying average Israeli wants Gaza, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1500.4s)]
*  Russian immigrants and Arabs and Africans are very much pro-Palestine here. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1502.08s)]
*  Dog, what are you talking about? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1505.28s)]
*  I, I already, what are you saying? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1507.6799999999998s)]
*  I already mentioned that 25% of the Israeli population is non-Jewish. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1510.32s)]
*  According to Israel's own demographics, 25% their attitude towards burning Gaza is very [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1517.6799999999998s)]
*  different than the Jewish Israeli populations overwhelming support for burning Gaza, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1524.96s)]
*  the ground or mass exterminating and ethnically cleansing Gaza. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1530.8s)]
*  There was a recent poll that came out also saying Russian adding, adding Russian immigrants into [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1536.0s)]
*  that equation is really funny. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1541.68s)]
*  I don't think that the, I don't, I don't think that the Russian immigrants in Israel are, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1543.04s)]
*  are not on board with what Israel's doing. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1547.28s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1551.36s)]
*  Arabs and Africans on the other hand, like the non, the non-Jewish population in Israel, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1552.48s)]
*  yes, they are not in support of, of, they're not in support of what Israel is doing. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1558.16s)]
*  This is true, but they're 25% of the population and they're basically de facto second, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1563.52s)]
*  second class citizens. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1568.16s)]
*  You know this already, you're an Israeli chatter that is in this community. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1569.76s)]
*  You, you know, I, I know that like you can't get access to Al Jazeera anymore, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1574.0800000000002s)]

*  So you probably see it. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1580.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1582.0s)]
*  Oh, this is the thing that I was talking about. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1582.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1583.8400000000001s)]
*  70% of Israelis support the second phase of the hostage ceasefire deal, right? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1584.4s)]
*  70% of the Israelis support the second phase of the hostage ceasefire deal. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1589.2s)]
*  Having said that, which would require Israel to pull out, okay, which would require the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1592.5600000000002s)]
*  Israeli Jews to pull out of Gaza. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1598.0s)]
*  When asked directly about even Trump's plan of mass displacement of Palestinians, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1600.16s)]
*  Israelis also have, Israeli Jews specifically have the same exact attitude. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1607.44s)]
*  The reason why they want to continue with the pullout is because they want all the [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1612.72s)]
*  hostages out. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1616.48s)]
*  That's it. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1617.6000000000001s)]
*  The reason why they want to continue the ceasefire is because they want to pull the hostages out. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1618.72s)]
*  Can you please give a definition of anti-Zionism in the context of not asking for the removal [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1626.96s)]
*  of people in Israel? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1630.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1632.24s)]
*  I believe that currently I look at things honestly, I believe that currently there is [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1632.8s)]
*  already one singular state. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1638.4s)]
*  It's Israel. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1640.8s)]
*  It is an apartheid state. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1641.84s)]
*  Israel dominates the Gaza Strip and is doing a genocide on the Gaza Strip. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1643.12s)]
*  Israel also has bantastans in the West Bank. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1647.28s)]
*  Israel has illegally occupied the West Bank since 1967, militarily. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1651.12s)]
*  There's a shift happening here since Trump is in office. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1655.76s)]
*  Right-wingers here are even turning on Netanyahu. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1657.76s)]
*  I haven't seen that. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1661.1999999999998s)]
*  But my point is, my point is that there is already one state and the two-state solution [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1662.24s)]
*  has been a lie that right-wing Israeli governments and even centrist Israeli governments [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1670.0s)]
*  have basically been using to continue settling the West Bank, which is what they did. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1675.68s)]
*  I think it was like 80,000 people living in East Jerusalem mostly in the 90s. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1683.84s)]
*  After the so-called peace process, that number shot up in 2025 to 750,000. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1690.16s)]
*  And not just in East Jerusalem, but East Jerusalem and just West Bank proper. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1697.44s)]
*  750,000 Jews live in the West Bank. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1702.64s)]
*  750,000 settlers live on occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1707.0400000000002s)]
*  And that happened over the peace process, the so-called peace process, as every single [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1712.4s)]
*  government kept kicking the can down the line over and over again. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1718.8000000000002s)]
*  So the notion of a two-state solution would require 750,000 settlers to be removed. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1722.32s)]
*  That is never going to happen. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1730.3999999999999s)]
*  It's just not going to happen. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1731.9199999999998s)]
*  You have to be realistic. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1733.28s)]
*  So the anti-Zionist position that I have as a one-stater is to implement by force, if necessary, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1735.04s)]
*  a singular, solitary, secular state. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1743.52s)]
*  And this position is not necessarily popular amongst Palestinians and it's not necessarily [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1747.2s)]
*  popular amongst Israelis either, but it is my position. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1751.68s)]
*  You can have a disagreement with that. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1756.64s)]
*  All you want with or without the right to return. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1758.3200000000002s)]
*  Yes, of course, with the right to return with the right to return with reparations, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1760.72s)]
*  with a truth and reconciliation committee that needs to be implemented to prosecute war criminals. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1766.8s)]
*  And yes, even people who have engaged in war crimes on the Palestinian side as well. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1773.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1779.68s)]
*  Now, of course, when resisting against an apartheid regime, the crimes that you commit [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1780.32s)]
*  at the behest of resisting against an apartheid regime are going to be viewed differently [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1786.8799999999999s)]
*  than being one of the fucking war crimes, the war criminals on the side of the apartheid regime. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1792.0s)]
*  But having said that, yes, that is what needs to happen. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1799.28s)]
*  Now, I personally think that is also incredibly difficult to ever implement, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1802.56s)]
*  but there is no other way out of this. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1809.28s)]
*  In my opinion, there's just no other way out of this. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1810.96s)]
*  So if you ask me what I think should be done, that's what I believe. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1813.28s)]
*  Truth and reconciliation, reparations for all Palestinians that have had their land and [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1817.28s)]
*  homes stolen from them, a right to return for all Palestinians and a singular secular state. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1823.28s)]
*  The thing that obviously stops this from happening is the fear that Israelis have, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1830.08s)]
*  Israeli society has, specifically Israeli Jews by and large, that this would mean that there are [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1834.96s)]
*  more Palestinians there and more non-Jews there than Jewish citizens. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1841.04s)]
*  And therefore, they will democratically do the same thing that Israel's been doing to [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1845.44s)]
*  the Palestinians for the past 76 years. They will forcibly repress and oppress and destroy [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1849.28s)]
*  and kill and ethnically cleanse all Jews in the region. That has not ever happened throughout [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1855.44s)]
*  history with one exception, which was the Haitian revolution. That has never happened [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1862.0s)]
*  throughout history. That did not happen in the abolition of slavery, which is like probably the [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1867.84s)]
*  closest comparison that you can present in terms of the 76 years of occupation. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1873.92s)]
*  I'm going to come across, come off as a flat earther, but I don't think the polls are accurate [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1879.52s)]
*  on how Israelis feel. They're just libs who are slow as going more and more broke. Shit's expensive, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1882.56s)]
*  man. I can't even afford the top of the hours. Okay. Well, don't worry. I don't run top of [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1887.68s)]
*  the hour outbreaks any longer anyway. But yeah, I mean, the Haitians didn't enslave the white people. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1891.92s)]
*  They killed them. Yes. Even with Haiti, that's an oversimplification. I agree. But I'm saying that [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1896.72s)]
*  mass violence in the aftermath of a revolution historically has only happened in one instance, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1901.76s)]
*  one successful slave revolt, which was the Haitian revolution. The Nat Turner rebellion took place [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1907.3600000000001s)]
*  in the United States of America, but in the aftermath of the abolition of slavery, what [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1912.8000000000002s)]
*  happened? Were there roaming gangs of newly freed black men and women that were massacring [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1916.88s)]
*  and enslaving white people? No, it didn't happen. It didn't happen in Algeria. No, it did not happen [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1924.24s)]
*  in Algeria. That's not a comparison either. It did not happen in Algeria. People voluntarily left [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1929.6000000000001s)]
*  Algeria because they did not want to fucking live in Algeria. And it didn't happen in apartheid [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1936.5600000000002s)]
*  South Africa. And it didn't happen in Ireland either. But the reason why I use the abolition [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1940.3200000000002s)]
*  of slavery is because that is one of the closest systematized versions of harm that is like [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1946.64s)]
*  genocidal, close to a genocide, or in some ways might even be considered worse. That's the reason [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1961.92s)]
*  why I use that as an example. What usually ends up happening in this process is that [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1968.88s)]
*  the same violent rabid settler groups will basically continue doing clan style violence upon [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1976.64s)]
*  the Palestinians. And they need to be dealt with through the criminal justice system. That's it. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1983.1200000000001s)]
*  That is the most likely outcome here. This is not a power in Gaza. Right now, we should bring back [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1990.0s)]
*  the hostages and it includes ending the war and we must work with it. What's not, couldn't these [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=1995.92s)]
*  settlers just fall under the leadership of a new Palestinian state? No, dude, they would never [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2002.32s)]
*  fucking, that would never happen. That is what is supposed to happen right now. Like the Palestinian [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2006.32s)]
*  position right now, the Hamas position on this and the Palestinian resistance position on the [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2011.9199999999998s)]
*  seven boundaries, okay, which is not objectionable. That is appropriate. That's the basis of the two [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2015.52s)]
*  state solution. How will you get to the 1967 boundaries? I mean, 750,000 Israeli Jews, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2022.08s)]
*  some of the most rabid, some of the most right-wing, some of the most insane members [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2030.16s)]
*  of Israeli society that are violent expansionists, exterminationists, that basically are the Jewish KKK, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2036.0800000000002s)]
*  okay? Those guys are going to leave? No, of course not. And Israel weaponizes them anyway. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2045.6000000000001s)]
*  While the broader Israeli society pre-October 7 might have looked at these settlers as [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2052.96s)]
*  welfare queens who are just like living off government dollars as they suffer. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2059.68s)]
*  Liberal Israeli society hates the settlers because they're uneducated, filthy, whatever the fuck they [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2064.56s)]

*  How are you going to end it? You're not going to? We're going to conquer Gaza and we're going to [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2122.08s)]

*  The fighting in Gaza is having a devastating side effect on some Palestinian communities in [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2174.64s)]

*  and violence at the hands of Israeli settlers. Dozens of rural farms like this one have already [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2199.76s)]
*  been abandoned as a result. But such violence is only increasing. This is just one of several [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2205.76s)]
*  incidents documented by Israeli NGO Bitz Salim over recent months. The organization says dozens [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2213.6s)]
*  of settlers descended on the occupied West Bank. Yeah, that's the... This is now we're moving on to [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2220.0s)]
*  the other side. The Israeli apartheid and what it looks like to live under the Israeli apartheid in [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2224.56s)]
*  the West Bank. When you look at Gaza, that's what a genocide looks like. When you look at the West [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2230.56s)]
*  Bank, that's what pogroms under an apartheid looks like. This is a systematized version of violence [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2235.2799999999997s)]
*  that is outsourced to the most rabid fucking psychopaths that you have ever seen. It's as though [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2241.12s)]

*  is such a disgusting way to approach the subject matter. No, Palestinians are being forcibly removed [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2270.88s)]
*  from their land illegally by rabid terrorists who are backed by the government. That's what's going [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2277.2000000000003s)]
*  on is they're not leaving. They're not voluntarily leaving. They are experiencing pogroms. Okay, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2288.8s)]
*  they're experiencing ethnic cleansing. I don't have any sympathy for anyone that doesn't recognize [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2297.2799999999997s)]

*  And of course, the Israeli, it's not just that either Israeli Israeli Israel said, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2311.68s)]
*  settlers from margins of the mainstream, the listening post. This is for the record, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2318.8799999999997s)]
*  why I appreciate the, the activists that still, regardless of whatever their fucking opinion is [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2323.44s)]
*  on Israel, the Israeli Jewish activists that put their bodies in front of this process, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2331.76s)]
*  I still think are important. Okay. Like if they're saving one Palestinian family, that's still good. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2337.44s)]
*  You just got to work with who you have. You got to work with the tools at your disposal. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2345.04s)]
*  And while Israeli police forces demolish the outpost established in the village by settlers, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2349.76s)]
*  but Selim says the outpost was later rebuilt that same day. Dozens of Palestinian heard and [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2356.0800000000004s)]
*  communities have been impacted by the spread of outposts like this one, essentially undefined [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2362.4s)]
*  settlements, usually made up of small structures or caravans. Israeli anti-settlement watchdogs, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2368.1600000000003s)]
*  Peace Now and Kerem Navot say at least 49 outposts were established in the months [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2374.88s)]
*  following the October 7th attacks, an increase of nearly 50% since the beginning of the war in Gaza. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2380.32s)]
*  As of last December, the groups estimate that herding outpost covered almost 14% of the occupied [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2387.44s)]
*  West bank. That's an area of land roughly twice the size of Gaza. And that's in addition to [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2393.6800000000003s)]
*  approximately recognized settlements that have already been- I really care about Palestine and [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2399.84s)]
*  hope you cover it a lot, but every time I click on your channel is so off and on. It's important [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2404.08s)]
*  and there's a lot of other important things too. Maybe I'm just unlucky when I click here. Yes, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2407.52s)]
*  because I don't just cover the Israeli government's actions in Palestine. I'm live for [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2412.24s)]
*  eight fucking hours a day. If you think that this is the only thing that I cover, you're wrong. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2420.16s)]
*  Bank. Both outposts and settlements are considered illegal under international law. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2426.08s)]
*  Satellite imagery analyzed by CNN shows how rapidly herding outposts have spread, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2431.44s)]
*  as well as the gradual development of new roads connecting the outposts to established settlements. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2437.44s)]
*  What are outposts? Tents? No, outposts are the ways in which settlers expand into [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2444.6400000000003s)]
*  Palestinian territory. Here's how it works. You go and you mark a house, oftentimes the star of David. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2453.6s)]
*  Okay. That means that that house that has Palestinian people living in it needs to be [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2459.92s)]
*  evacuated immediately. Otherwise they will die. And sometimes they do die. They go in, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2466.48s)]
*  they burn the house down with Molotov cocktails. They beat the shit out of people. They oftentimes [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2472.88s)]
*  have guns. They shoot at the houses. They shoot at the Palestinians that are living in their own [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2477.12s)]
*  homes in the West bank. Then the Israeli occupying force comes in. The Israeli occupying [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2482.32s)]
*  force doesn't come in to stop the settlers. The Israeli occupying force, as a matter of fact, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2489.92s)]
*  comes in and militarily defends the settlements. Okay. In the aftermath of that process, once they've [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2494.2400000000002s)]
*  successfully ethnically cleansed the Palestinians from that land, they built outposts. Outposts is a [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2500.96s)]
*  militarized version of a home. The reason for why they build these outposts is to segment off [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2507.28s)]
*  different areas of Palestinian land from one another. Because once you build those outposts, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2515.52s)]
*  then the Israeli government comes in and builds roads. Roads that Palestinians can't drive on. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2521.6000000000004s)]
*  Remember, this is their own land, internationally recognized as occupied Palestinian territory, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2526.8s)]
*  illegally occupied by the Israeli government. So they build compounds that cut across Palestinian [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2532.56s)]
*  land deliberately, and then they build roads across Palestinian land deliberately. And then they don't [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2539.52s)]
*  fucking let the Palestinians drive on those roads. All of this is done in an effort to trap [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2544.72s)]
*  Palestinians into bantastans. A similar concept that existed in South Africa as well during the [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2551.12s)]
*  South African apartheid. Every step of the process, the Israeli government protects, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2559.28s)]
*  militarily protects the settlers engaging in this act of terrorism. Because the Israeli government [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2564.5600000000004s)]
*  itself is a terrorist government. The Israeli government itself is a fascist government. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2570.1600000000003s)]
*  Outposts are built to envelope Palestinian lands in the same way it was done to Gaza, hence the [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2575.36s)]
*  name the Gaza envelope. Yes, the Gaza envelope is the kibbutzim that are the first line of defense [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2580.96s)]
*  surrounding the Gaza Strip. In some cases, cutting Palestinians off from the land that they depend [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2586.24s)]
*  on. In the northern village of Al-Farisiya, the local farming community has now been almost [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2593.3599999999997s)]
*  entirely depopulated. Back in February, we met the Deir Aghma family, at the time still desperately [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2600.16s)]
*  clinging on to their land. These hills are full of areas for our animals to feed, but now there [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2607.4399999999996s)]

*  There is nothing funnier than entertaining the hubris of ultra-Zionist gentiles who think [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2653.44s)]
*  that they literally are more Jewish than Jewish people, you know, because they're more pro-Israel [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVlQkl9fZc&t=2663.2799999999997s)]
