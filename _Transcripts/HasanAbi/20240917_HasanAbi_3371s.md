# First Trump Campaign After Assassination Attempt | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4)
*  Putin, I got along great with President Xi, I got along great with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=0.0s)]
*  Bro heard major threat and immediately went to like what? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  He's still doing worse than Kamala Harris is shocking. At least Kamala Harris like [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=10.16s)]
*  here's the question and then has like a repeated answer that she's been repeating since the DNC. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Finally, Mike Goat is here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=20.16s)]
*  Damn, he's got extra protection now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=37.04s)]
*  Lean beef patty commented on your head size just now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=50.63999999999999s)]
*  Bigger. He's very tall. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah, the small head right compared to the shoulders. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=57.6s)]
*  You wish you had my size mischief. You wish. That's very of Canute as a classic. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=74.8s)]
*  Thanks, bro. If someone misses Trump a third time, does he get to walk the first base for free? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  No, brother. He doesn't even get to overcome the top of the hour ad break for free. He has to still [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=86.08s)]
*  subscribe for $6. Well, I guess he could do it for free as long as he has an Amazon Prime account [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=91.2s)]
*  connected to a twitch account where he will get one free prime subscription a month. That's the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=97.36s)]
*  only way. Anyway, here's the three minute break now. He kissed Sarah fuckabee Sanders. That's a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=101.44s)]
*  lot of people for a town hall. Nobody's ever seen a town hall like this. You know, a town hall [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=108.0s)]
*  is supposed to have about 300 people. You have about 8,000 people here. And equally as important, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=113.2s)]
*  you have about 8,000 people that are not here. They're walking away. But I think we have television [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=118.72s)]
*  outside, right? So they're watching from outside. Would anybody like to change places with them? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=123.6s)]
*  I thought you were going to say that. Thank you, everybody. Hello, Sarah. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=128.24s)]
*  Mr. President, nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=131.6s)]
*  Well, it's been a great experience. It's a dangerous business, however, being president. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  It's a little bit dangerous. It's, you know, the race car driving is dangerous. No, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  they think bull riding. That's pretty scary, right? No, this is a dangerous business. So we [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  have to keep it safe. Mr. President, I don't think there's a person certain. I don't get it. Why did [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=152.48s)]
*  he bring Sarah fucka be there? And not like a Michigan person doesn't remember exactly where [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=158.16s)]
*  they were on July 13th, that Saturday when a horrific thing happened, an attack not just on you, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=166.48s)]
*  but what I see is an attack on our entire country. They have this as static, but it also has [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=175.12s)]
*  subtitles. That one doesn't have subtitles. I joined with everyone. We know that you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=182.16s)]
*  were tough. We saw it every day on the campaign. We saw it when you were president, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=189.52s)]
*  but I don't think anybody was prepared for what we saw that day. And now it's happened not once, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=196.4s)]
*  but twice. You've literally taken a bullet for our country. Oh, here, here. And yet you keep [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=203.52s)]
*  fighting. You never give up. The reason that you're going to win in November is because [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=210.88s)]
*  America needs a fighter. And we've never needed a fighter more. And we've never had somebody more [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=217.04s)]
*  qualified to step in and lead our country than you. I'd love for you to tell us why do you want to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  be president and why do you continue fighting even after they keep attacking you every single day? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=226.48s)]
*  So we ran. Thank you, everybody. A lot of love in this room. I love you. You love Sarah. So [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=230.0s)]
*  we ran in 2016 and it was amazing. It was amazing. And we won. We then ran in 2020. We did much [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=235.2s)]
*  better than 2016. People don't like to hear it. You know, oh, he's a conspiracy theorist. You know, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  we got millions and millions more votes. We did much better. Wasn't even a contest. I was telling [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  one of the papers. They said, what was the difference? I said, well, the difference is we [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=253.92s)]
*  did much, much better the second time, but we had a lot of things happen. We know what those things [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  are. So what difference? Because now, because now in like 48 days or whatever it might be, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=264.16s)]
*  we're going to do something that will I'm trying to link it. It's not working. I'm just going to go [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=270.56s)]
*  Europe. They want it to happen. Even though they, even though they would not prefer dealing with me [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=275.44s)]
*  in terms of something that will there it is. I don't think it's going to shock the world. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  Actually, I think the world is going to be maybe prepared already in Europe. They want it to happen. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=286.88s)]
*  Even though the problem is though, PBS doesn't have like sick ass. Isn't that a sauna trust fund [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=292.08s)]
*  baby? No dumb ass. I'm not. Why do people, why you have to ask yourself, why do you believe [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=297.2s)]
*  like someone just making up about me? I wish I wish I was a trust fund baby dumb. Anyway, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=303.76s)]
*  as I was going to say, PBS news is fine, but they don't have those sick ass ads on the side, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=310.08s)]
*  but we did phenomenally well and bad, bad things happened. We're not going to let it happen again. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=314.8s)]
*  And now I'll tell you, so 2016, a lot of spirit, 2020, we had unbelievable spirit and then we got [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=319.2s)]
*  let down because what happened should never be allowed to happen in this country again. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=326.8s)]
*  But, but I have never seen the spirit like I've seen right now. This for this race. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=331.36s)]
*  Oh, we got Gamba. Will Trump say he solved the Flint water crisis? It blows it away from 2016, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=340.32s)]
*  from 2020. And basically it's very simple. You're saying what we're going to seal the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=346.8s)]
*  border immediately. We're going to drill baby drill. You know, we're going to drill at a level. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=352.32s)]
*  We're going to bring your energy prices down. We're going to try and get rid of a lot of that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=356.0s)]
*  big lump of inflation that this administration has given us. And I have to say that president [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=361.04s)]
*  Biden called me yesterday. It was very nice. We had a very nice conversation. I appreciated [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=368.0s)]
*  that he called about, you know, what happened the other day. And he says, he's committed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=371.92s)]
*  He's committed. No, but, and today I, a little while ago, I got a very nice call from Kamala. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=378.8s)]
*  No, it was very nice. It was very nice. It's, it's, it was very, very nice. And, and we appreciate [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=385.68s)]
*  that, but we have to take back our country. We have to win. We're going to win and we're going [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=392.0s)]
*  to make America great again. That's all there is to it. Very simple. I think it's safe to say that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=397.36s)]
*  this crowd will all be voting for you. You know, when I think of this state, it's so sad. Years ago, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=403.76s)]
*  I was given, thank you very much, but years ago I was given an award as like man of the year or [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=410.88s)]
*  something from an area that nobody knew. And the press said, Oh, it never happened. Well, then it [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=416.56s)]
*  did happen. They found out where it was, but it was like 15 years ago, a beautiful area, but nobody [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=421.92s)]
*  remembered it. Nobody remembered it all. All of a sudden, like through a miracle, they found out [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=428.72s)]
*  it did exist. And it was there. And I had the speech and the speech was, don't let them take [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=434.32s)]
*  your automobile industry away. They're taking your automobile industry away. And I don't know why [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=439.6s)]
*  you're doing now. I wasn't a politician. I was an entrepreneur. I was a real estate developer, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=445.04s)]
*  doing great, having a lot of fun, doing a much simpler life than this. Who would think that a [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=450.0s)]
*  developer's life is simple, but it's a lot simpler than this. But I said, don't let them do that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=454.56s)]
*  because here I am in Michigan and I was getting an award and I'm making a speech. I'm saying, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=459.68s)]
*  what am I going to say? But I just watch common sense. I saw them leaving for Mexico, leaving [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=464.0s)]
*  for China. Do you know that right now, and they weren't building them with me, they weren't [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=468.8s)]
*  building anything in Mexico having to do with cars with me. Cause I said, if you build it, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=473.52s)]
*  we're going to put a 200%. You're not going to sell one car into this country. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=477.28s)]
*  But right now they're building some of the largest auto plants anywhere in the world ever built. I [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=482.32s)]
*  have a friend that does that for a living. Very good at it. He's the best, I think. And he's [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  actually a contributor, a supporter, but he builds the plants. And I say, you know, I'd like to go [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=493.44s)]
*  see a plant, a really great auto plant. You know, it's amazing technology, amazing what they do, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=498.88s)]
*  really incredible the amount of automobiles they can produce and the size of these things. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=504.96s)]
*  I'd like to see a real modern plant. And he's the one that does them. And I said, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=510.08s)]
*  so where would we go? I was hoping he'd say Detroit or someplace up here, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=514.48s)]
*  but anywhere in this country, I'll take anywhere in this country, right? So will you, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=519.28s)]
*  my greatest guy right over here. Stand up, will you please? He's so, he's such a great guy. Oh, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=522.8s)]
*  hi everybody. We're going to bring them back. We're going to bring them back. We're not just [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=530.72s)]
*  going to keep, you know, you're losing your jobs, the whole thing, but just so they're building. So [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=536.4s)]
*  I said, where would I go? And let's go take a look at a beauty. He said, well, we'll have to go to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=541.2s)]
*  Mexico. I said, wait a minute, I'm not interested. I'm not interested. No, I want to know here. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=544.96s)]
*  He said, here we don't build top of the line. We build smaller plants. We build, we just, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=551.12s)]
*  you know, there's just not that kind of a thing. And I said, isn't it sad? He, he feels that too. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=556.56s)]
*  You know, he's a United States guy, but he said, if you want to see the big ones, you're going to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=560.7199999999999s)]
*  have to go to Mexico. They're owned and built by China in Mexico. And there are a number of them [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=565.68s)]
*  going up right now. And they think they're going to make their cars there and they're going to sell [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=572.64s)]
*  them across our line. And we're going to take them and we're not going to charge them tax. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=577.1999999999999s)]
*  We're going to charge them. I'm telling you right now, I'm putting a 200% tariff on, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=581.1199999999999s)]
*  which means they're unsellable, unsellable in the United States. And then you wonder why I get [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=584.88s)]
*  shot at only consequential presidents get that. When I say something like that, you have countries [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=590.24s)]
*  saying this guy, but what can you do? You have to do, you have to do what you have to do, right? You [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=597.04s)]
*  have to, we have to be brave. Otherwise we're not going to have a country left. So what's happening [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=602.72s)]
*  is they're building these massive auto plants and they think they're going to make tens of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=608.08s)]
*  thousands of automobiles and sell them in here. No tax, no nothing. It's not going to happen. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=612.32s)]
*  When you put on tariffs, tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented. I took in, I took in [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=617.6s)]
*  $467 billion from China. Nobody else took in anything. And China's economy is not even doing [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=623.2s)]
*  that well. And, and Biden, you know, they, they have not been able and Kamala, they have not been [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=630.6400000000001s)]
*  able to take those tariffs off because there's so much money. And frankly, if they did take them off [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=637.0400000000001s)]
*  this country would be flooded with Chinese cars. You don't have the Chinese cars. We put a pretty [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=642.0s)]
*  good tariff on it was going to be lifted at some point. Then we had COVID. We did a tremendous job [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=646.96s)]
*  in COVID. We gave you a stock market that was higher than just prior to COVID coming in. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=652.0s)]
*  And we did a great job. We never got credit. We got credit for the best economy, maybe ever. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=657.12s)]
*  We got credit for having defeated ISIS and having rebuilt our military. We shouldn't have given, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=661.6s)]
*  Sarah, we shouldn't have given $85 billion worth of equipment to the Taliban, to Afghanistan. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=667.76s)]
*  In, in, I think, and I think the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that whole [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  thing was the most when we were leaving, we were leaving with me. I was the one that got it down [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=680.24s)]
*  to the right number. We were going to keep the big air base, which is exactly one hour away from [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=685.36s)]
*  where China makes its weapons. Think of that one hour away and we gave it up. We just gave it up. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  One of the biggest, one of the most, we spent billions and billions of dollars many years ago. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=697.12s)]
*  The runways can hold more weight than any runway ever built. Think of that. They're, I think, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=702.0s)]
*  19,000 feet long, which is, you know, three times what a normal runway would be. It's a, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=707.52s)]
*  it's called Bagram. And we were going to keep that because of China, not because of Afghanistan, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=713.12s)]
*  one hour away from where they make their weapons. So that was a good one. We left, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=718.4s)]
*  we left and the way we got out was so embarrassing. And because of that, first of all, 13 dead soldiers, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=722.24s)]
*  I've gotten to know their families, their incredible families, but they'll never be the same. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  Many badly injured, you know, nobody, or nobody ever talks about the soldiers that are badly, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=733.6s)]
*  and they talk about 13 dead. And we always have to say that number one and great families, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=739.36s)]
*  but nobody ever mentions the fact that some of the soldiers were hurt so badly, the arms, the legs, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  the face, like obliteration. We left American citizens behind. It's so funny when they boo [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=751.04s)]
*  the Taliban, a fundamentalist terror organization, but then loudly support the idea of a fundamentalist [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=756.88s)]
*  terror organization. Okay, but they also literally love the Taliban as long as it's like white people [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=760.64s)]
*  doing it in the name of Jesus in America. The only difference between Taliban and like the American [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=766.8s)]
*  version of the Taliban is that they're not brown and they don't wear eye makeup except for JD Vance, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=775.12s)]
*  who does wear the Taliban style guyliner. 777,000 rifles and guns. Think of that. How do you, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=780.08s)]
*  how do you have that anyway? Who would put that? We have 71,000 trucks and cars and again, many of [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=787.2s)]
*  them armor plated. So what happened is when Russia looked at that, they said, we're going and we're [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=794.88s)]
*  going to invade. We're going to go into Ukraine. If that didn't happen, I don't think, and I guarantee [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=800.24s)]
*  you if the election were a straight election, we won that election. We should have won that [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=805.68s)]
*  election. Everybody knew we won the election. They would have never attacked Putin. Putin never would [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=810.8s)]
*  have attacked, but the oil prices got driven up at a hundred dollars a barrel. He made money. He's [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=816.7199999999999s)]
*  the only guy fought a war and you make money fighting a war, but it got driven up because of [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=822.3199999999999s)]
*  their bad energy policies. But when he saw that and you wouldn't have had, think of this, you [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=826.64s)]
*  wouldn't have had, how different would the world be? You wouldn't have had Ukraine being attacked [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=832.64s)]
*  by Russia. You wouldn't have had October 7th in Israel where that horrible situation took place [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  because Iran was essentially broke. They had very little money and we would have made a great deal [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=844.08s)]
*  with them. All we want is we don't want them to have a weapon. Very simple. That's all we want. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=850.16s)]
*  We don't want you to have a weapon. We would have made a good deal with Iran. They would have been [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=855.04s)]
*  happy and I think they're going to end up being very unhappy, but it's very dangerous. They're [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=858.7199999999999s)]
*  very close to a weapon. And the other thing, you wouldn't have had inflation. You wouldn't [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=863.04s)]
*  have had inflation because inflation was driven up by their bad energy policy. And you remember [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=867.12s)]
*  your gasoline started going up to five and six dollars a gallon. And then what happened is they [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=872.56s)]
*  said, oh, we're going to get, we have an election. We're going to get, and they went back to my [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  policy. So they went back to the same. What they don't, and they say we produce the same amount as [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  Trump. Well, they went right back to my policy or they would have, you would have been buying, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=887.12s)]
*  you would have had $25 a gallon gasoline. So they went back. What they don't say is though, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=890.64s)]
*  I would have been producing four times as much and I took us from third into first place by a lot, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=896.48s)]
*  but we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country in the world, including Saudi [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=902.88s)]
*  Arabia, including Russia. And we would have had, we would have had, we would have been so dominant [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=908.24s)]
*  in energy. We would have, you know, we were, we were, we didn't need any energy from anybody. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=914.88s)]
*  We didn't have to protect any other countries in order to get their oil, which we've done for many [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=920.4s)]
*  years in the Middle East. We were energy independent. Sounds so beautiful to say it. We're energy [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=924.88s)]
*  independent. We were soon going to be energy dominant and we would have been now having so [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=930.16s)]
*  much money coming out of the energy. We just have the best. We have Bagram in Alaska. They say it [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=935.76s)]
*  might be as big, might be bigger than all of Saudi Arabia. I got it approved. Ronald Reagan [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=942.56s)]
*  couldn't do it. Nobody could do it. I got it done. In their first week, they terminated it. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=948.2399999999999s)]
*  Check that one out. Bagram. Check that one out. It's, it's, no, think about this. Between [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=952.9599999999999s)]
*  Bagram, between you go to Anwar, you, you take a look at the kind of things that we've given up. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=960.2399999999999s)]
*  We should be, we should have that air base. We should have that oil. We should have, we would [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=968.88s)]
*  have had a whole different country, but to give up Anwar, to give up the biggest air base, military [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  air base in the world, and they left it in the dark of night with the lights on and they did leave [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=981.28s)]
*  the dogs behind. There are a lot of people, they say, what about the dogs? They left the dogs behind, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=987.52s)]
*  but we would have been, we would have been, we would have been a much different country right now. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=991.92s)]
*  But we're going to get it back. And I promise you, we're going to get it back with guys like this [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=998.64s)]
*  and people like that. And Sarah, just one thing, because this is the world's longest answer to, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1003.1999999999999s)]
*  what was the question? But the difference is I give an answer that's productive as opposed to an [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1009.6s)]
*  answer that is not very productive, right? Like in the debate, but just to, just to end this, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1014.48s)]
*  we are going to, for Michigan, cause we want to be a little bit Michigan centric. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1022.24s)]
*  You used to be the capital of the world in cars. Today, you're an afterthought in cars. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1028.0800000000002s)]
*  And I don't know the head of your union. I've never met the gentleman, Sean. I've never met him, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1034.64s)]
*  but yeah, these are real Michiganders right here. Sean Fain and the UAW are hometown heroes, dude. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1042.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? Cause that mandate is insane. They want to go all electric basically by [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1050.16s)]
*  2030. Like Sean Fain in this, in, in the state of Michigan, okay, is objectively a more popular [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1056.16s)]
*  figure than Donald Trump and Kamala Harris for very good reason. And Mexico, but they're all [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1064.88s)]

*  You're going to be as big or bigger than you were 50 years ago, because they won't be able, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1078.24s)]
*  if they're not willing to build a plant, we don't want their product. And that's enough. That's all [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1084.1599999999999s)]
*  I want. Crowd says otherwise. Yeah, dude, they bust them from Indiana. What do you mean? Crowd says [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1089.76s)]
*  otherwise. And it'll happen. It'll happen fast. It'll happen very fast. I think it's safe to say [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1096.1599999999999s)]
*  that Michigan is happy that you're going to be president again. What would you know about [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1102.72s)]
*  Michigan? Dumbass. You're not from there. Why is Sarah fuckabee Sanders there? Isn't she the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1106.96s)]
*  governor of like Arkansas or something? We have something to say because you actually got something [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1112.48s)]

*  story on the catapults on the aircraft carries. I do it with a lot of different stories. When I [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1155.68s)]
*  mentioned Dr. Hannibal Lecter, I'm using that as an example of people that are coming in from [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1160.24s)]

*  connected and many stories were told in that little paragraph. But there is something that [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1209.2s)]
*  they say that the other thing I say is this, we had 107,000 people show up in New Jersey. We had [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1214.8s)]

*  into another little bit of a long answer because when you say major threat, to me, we have one [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1328.64s)]
*  really major threat that's called, we call, we have other countries that are hostile to us. They [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1333.68s)]
*  don't have to be hostile to us. I always say, if you have a smart president, you'll never have a [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1340.72s)]
*  problem with China or Russia or any of them. Okay. I got along great with Putin. I got along great [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1344.3200000000002s)]
*  with President Xi. I got along great with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. Bro heard major threat [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1349.0400000000002s)]
*  and immediately went to like, what? He's still doing worse than Kamala Harris is shocking. At [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1354.96s)]
*  least Kamala Harris, like, here's the question. And then has like a repeated answer that she's [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1361.04s)]
*  been repeating since the DNC. This guy, here's the question. The last part of the question amigos [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1366.32s)]
*  threat. Oh, you mean are not good at negotiation. The war should have never happened. President [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1372.16s)]
*  Biden. I want to be nice. He was so nice to me yesterday, but you know, in one way, I sort of [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1378.72s)]
*  the question was what's the major threat to auto workers in this country? I'm so sorry about what [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1383.4399999999998s)]
*  happened at all that, but I have to lay it out. We have very important and the same with Kamala [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1388.56s)]
*  today. She could not have been nicer, but the fact is, the fact is we have to have talked about [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1393.4399999999998s)]
*  immigrants, dude. He could have been like immigrants are a major threat to the auto industry or some [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1400.0s)]
*  shit by other countries that have this. Even Pakistan has where we have, we have countries, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1403.84s)]
*  India has a lot of force. We have countries that have tremendous power. And when I hear these [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1410.24s)]
*  people talking about global warming, that's the global warming you have to worry about. Not that [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1415.92s)]
*  the ocean is going to rise in 400 years, an eighth of an inch and you'll have more seafront [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1420.8s)]
*  property, right? If that happens, I said, is that good or bad? I said, isn't that a good thing? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1425.36s)]
*  If I have a little property on the ocean, I have a little bit more property. I have a little bit [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1431.2s)]
*  more ocean. But the fact is that it's a, it's a tremendous problem and we are closer to world war [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1435.04s)]
*  three today than we've ever been. And the differences, and I say this a lot, this isn't [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1442.3999999999999s)]
*  army tanks going back and forth and shooting at the state events. Recently, this is obliteration, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1448.0s)]
*  the power of these. And I'm the one that revived it and I hated to do it, but you know, we had [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1452.6399999999999s)]
*  stuff that was 48 years old. They didn't even know if it worked. We have incredible stuff. So does [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1458.0s)]
*  Russia. China has much less, but they're going to catch up over four or five years. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1463.12s)]
*  It's the single biggest threat by far to civilization and nobody talks about it. They talk about global [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1467.6799999999998s)]
*  warming. Used to be, remember? Used to be global warming. You know, they changed the name. You know [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1475.4399999999998s)]
*  why? Because the planet is getting cooler now. So now what they call it is climate change because [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1480.1599999999999s)]
*  that covers everything. See climate change, if it gets hot, cooled, you know, these people, I don't [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1486.32s)]
*  know if they're for real, but if they're not, they're covered by the words climate change. If [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1491.76s)]
*  it gets cooler, that's good. If it gets hotter, that's good. Global warming wasn't working so well, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1496.64s)]
*  but the single biggest threat. Okay. Now let's assume we have a really smart president and that's [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1501.12s)]
*  not going to be a threat because we have a lot of power doing business with China is a good thing, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1506.4s)]
*  but you have to have a fair deal doing business with Russia. They have so much in terms of [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1510.32s)]
*  minerals and things. The size of their land mass is like four times bigger than the United States. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1515.28s)]
*  The minerals and things they have, we can do great business and you keep everybody happy. You can [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1521.68s)]
*  solve that problem, but let's talk about the local problem. The local problem is that you have [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1526.64s)]
*  countries stealing your business. Mexico is a very big one. Mexico, this year we have a deficit with [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1531.04s)]
*  Mexico of $250 billion. Think of this with Mexico, a little Mexico. You think of it as a little [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1538.72s)]
*  innocent place. We're losing our ass to Mexico. China, you don't even have to talk about. We have [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1545.68s)]
*  over a trillion dollars this year. I was charging them numbers that were unbelievable and now he's [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1552.88s)]
*  just totally giving up the ghost and we're going to lose a trillion dollars in deficits to China, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1558.48s)]
*  a trillion. That's not sustainable. We're going to turn it all around and we're going to do it [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1563.84s)]
*  through taxation and tariffs. It will be done in 24 hours and it'll change the whole planet. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1568.32s)]
*  Just so you know, Sarah, China became powerful because they charge. They don't call them tariffs. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1574.96s)]
*  They call it a tax. They call it, they don't call it tariffs. The word tariff is a beautiful word to [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1580.48s)]
*  me, but to a lot of people that don't understand, it's not a beautiful word because you have a lot [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1585.9199999999998s)]
*  of people that are paid off by these countries. They're taking care of these countries and they [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1590.0s)]
*  don't care about destroying the United States. They want millions of dollars in fees and [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1593.76s)]
*  consultation, but we will in literally in a period of 24 hours, we can change the whole [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1598.0s)]
*  trading of the whole world. They've taken advantage of our country for years. I stopped it. I stopped [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1606.0s)]
*  so much of it and then we had a focus on COVID, which a lot of people said was put in there for [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1613.36s)]
*  a reason. You know, it came out of the Wuhan lab, which I said right from the beginning, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1619.36s)]
*  all of you know, it didn't come out of a cave. They said a cave. It didn't come from France. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1623.76s)]
*  They blame France. They blame. They blamed. I call it the China virus because I like to be accurate. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1628.4799999999998s)]
*  You know, they call it, they call it the Spanish flu. They call it all different names. When [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1633.04s)]
*  something comes from a country, except for China, we have to call it COVID. What the hell does COVID [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1637.76s)]
*  mean to China virus? He's busting out the old classics, dude, because they were not happy [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1642.32s)]
*  with me as president. I actually had a great relationship with president. He's busting out [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1648.96s)]
*  the old classic. This is going to do real numbers. Oh wait, he lost in 2021. This was more relevant [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1653.2s)]
*  the other day endorsed Kamala and you got to get new material at this point, big dog. You got to [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1658.72s)]
*  get new material. You lost on this ticket. Okay. Because I love you and it's better to be doing it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1666.8s)]
*  So who knows, but he endorsed Kamala, which is a little unusual. I was watching. I said, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1673.76s)]
*  that's interesting. I think that's a good thing. Isn't it? It really is. But look, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1677.6s)]
*  we have to turn it around and we can, we're going to have a reciprocal. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1681.84s)]
*  The question was about what are the biggest threats for the American auto industry, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1686.3999999999999s)]
*  which was approximately 46 minutes ago. I repeat, the question was, Mr. President, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1691.6s)]
*  what do you perceive are the biggest threats to the auto industry? To which he started with nukes [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1698.32s)]
*  like China is going to nuke Michigan. But they say to them, we don't want your car or unless [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1704.0s)]
*  you build your plant in China. And there's nothing wrong with saying that that's smart. People say [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1712.0s)]
*  that we haven't said it for many years. I said it. We have a lot of plants going up with Apple [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1717.28s)]
*  and other things. I said, you, you got to build plans. You don't build plants here. We're going [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1722.48s)]
*  to put the tariffs on your products coming in from China. So we can, we can have what's called [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1726.4s)]
*  there is no doubt to be connected about the auto industry in Michigan and nukes. Okay. Unless he's [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1732.24s)]
*  like, we're going to make the nukes in Michigan. I want to take that reciprocal trade. If they [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1738.08s)]
*  charge us a hundred percent, we charge them a hundred percent. He said, you mean they charge [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1742.88s)]
*  us. We charge them. You got me. How simple could it be? It was sort of cool. Cause he doesn't care. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1748.24s)]
*  He's a Senator. Doesn't care about trade, but you know, so we're going to call it the Trump [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1754.24s)]
*  Reciprocal Trade Act or I'll leave the name Trump off as long as we do it. So when India, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1758.16s)]
*  which is a very big abuser, he happens to be coming to meet me next week and Modi, he's [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1763.52s)]
*  fantastic. I mean, fantastic man. These, a lot of these leaders are fantastic. You have to understand [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1769.92s)]
*  one thing. They're dealing, they're a hundred percent. These people are the sharpest people. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1776.0s)]
*  They're not a little bit backward. They're not, they are at the top. You know, the expression [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1782.64s)]
*  they're at the top of their game and they use it against us. But India is very tough. Brazil's very [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1787.6s)]
*  tough. There are certain countries. I can tell you everyone I can give you from top to bottom. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1793.36s)]
*  China is the toughest of all, but we were taking care of China with the tariffs. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1797.6799999999998s)]
*  So we're going to do a reciprocal trade. If anybody charges us 10 cents, if they charge us [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1802.08s)]
*  $2, if they charge us a hundred percent, 250, we charge them the same thing. And you know, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1808.08s)]
*  what's going to happen? Everything's going to disappear and we're going to end up having free [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1814.0s)]
*  trade again. And if it doesn't disappear, we're going to take in a lot of money. Okay. But you [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1818.4s)]
*  know, the biggest beneficiary, I believe is going to be your state. And I won't say that to other [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1823.76s)]
*  states. I promise about your state. You are going to have plants built at a level that you haven't [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1828.0800000000002s)]
*  seen in 50 years. Great question. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. He tied it back. He tied it back. I was [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1834.48s)]
*  too small brain to understand the genius of Trump. The American worker as much as anything else, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1842.32s)]
*  and also make our country safer was you actually did something about the border. Just this month, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1848.32s)]
*  there was a woman in my home state of Arkansas who was a legal immigrant who was drunk driving [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1856.0s)]
*  that was deported during your administration and came back under this administration because they [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1863.76s)]
*  have failed to protect our country. It's one of the great threats that we face that you actually [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1869.52s)]
*  did something about. Tell us what you will do on day one to help protect our country. So we're going [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1875.28s)]
*  to be day one. We're doing two things, closing the border and drill baby drill. We're going to get [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1880.56s)]
*  down the prices. Why are people in Michigan like this excited for oil drilling? There's like you're [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1886.56s)]
*  in Michigan, dog. What the I like this crowd. I like this crowd. No, this you know what? You're [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1894.56s)]
*  smart people. So Sarah, thank you. So over the last couple of years, I've been talking about the [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1901.36s)]
*  border. I got elected in 2016 because of the border, but that border was peanuts compared to [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1909.2s)]
*  what this border is. That border was like a safe border compared. And I did it. I did a great job. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1914.96s)]
*  And it also includes drugs came to, you know, much lower. Look, unless you have the death [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1920.48s)]
*  penalty for drug dealers, you'll never get rid of the drug problem. Put that through your head. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1927.28s)]
*  Okay, put that through your head. And I don't know if our country is ready for it. When I was with [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1930.88s)]
*  President Xi and again, I had until COVID. I had a great relationship. Once that happened, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1937.84s)]
*  I really didn't want a relationship because $60 trillion, millions of dead people all over the [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1941.6s)]
*  world. I was not exactly thrilled with him. But before that, I had a great relationship. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1946.96s)]
*  And I said, do you have a drug problem? No, no, no, we have no drug problem. Oh, how come death [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1951.6000000000001s)]
*  penalty immediate? I said, what does that mean? Immediate immediate. We have what's called a quick [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1956.64s)]

*  They'll get some nice liberal lawyer and he'll have a tied up for 25 years. The guy dies of old [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1966.32s)]
*  age. So, uh, but they have a death penalty in Singapore. They have a death penalty in a lot of [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1971.28s)]
*  countries. They have a death penalty. You sell drugs because the average drug dealer during his [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1976.56s)]
*  or her life, 500 people, the average one, the big ones, much more. But when you hear that, you know, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1982.0s)]
*  when people start to hear that and I set up blue ribbon committees, I put, you know, nice people, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1989.12s)]
*  dilettantes from New York and from Los Angeles, people that know nothing about drugs and they're [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1994.08s)]
*  dealing with very smart people. These dealers are smart as hell. They're tough as hell. Then they [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=1998.72s)]
*  make a fortune. They make a fortune. And if you don't have the death penalty for drug dealers, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2004.0s)]
*  you could, you're just wasting your time. Now we can keep it down and we can do better than we're [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2008.8s)]
*  doing now and a lot better than we're doing now because what's happening now is out of control. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2012.64s)]
*  But we had the lowest human trafficking, mostly in women. I hate to say mostly in women, but we had [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2017.84s)]
*  the lowest human trafficking in 32 years. You know, my favorite chart, the chart I put down [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2023.52s)]
*  when I look to the right tonight, my, that'll be my all time favorite chart in history. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2029.12s)]
*  That was basically a chart showing what a good job I did on immigration. But even if it showed [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2034.56s)]
*  I did a bad job in immigration, it will be my all time favorite chart because I wouldn't be here [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2039.44s)]
*  right now. If I didn't look over, let me see that. That was not good. My all time favorite chart, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2043.9199999999998s)]
*  blue, yellow, red. It was, it was a beautiful, oh, there it is. There it is. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2051.44s)]
*  There, that was good. These guys are very good back. I didn't think that's a good, you know, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2058.8s)]
*  the interesting thing, it's always on my left when I did, it's at rallies. It's always on my list. I [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2062.32s)]
*  only do it about 15, maybe 20% of the time, so I don't do it much. And it's always at the end of a [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2067.68s)]
*  speech, but it's always here. For some reason they dropped it here. It was at the beginning of the [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2072.48s)]
*  speech, the very beginning couple of sentences, and I turned like a deer bolting, I guess, right? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2078.16s)]
*  They say good hunters say this every once in a while, a deer will bolt prior to, and I don't know, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2083.92s)]
*  I guess mine was a former, but I turned around to look at it. It was right here behind me, actually, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2088.96s)]
*  and my head was at a perfect angle. It got me, but if you got to be hit, that's the best place. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2094.56s)]
*  Although it's a, it's a blood, the doctor said, how come so much blood? He said the ear bleeds [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2100.16s)]
*  more than anything. I said, I'll take it. I'll take it. But, but it was, it was an amazing, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2105.12s)]
*  it was an amazing thing. And, and I have to say, because I've, I have to, while we're on the subject, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2111.7599999999998s)]
*  because people do like to talk about it, a few days ago we had an incident. I have to say Secret [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2118.3199999999997s)]
*  Service did a hell of a job. They really did. They caught one of the gentlemen that, one of the agents [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2124.88s)]
*  was walking a couple of holes in front and he saw a rifle AK 47. That's serious stuff, right? You [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2131.52s)]
*  know more about that. My sons know more about this stuff, but AK 47, that's it. That's it. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2139.12s)]
*  Someone in the chat said, it'll never not be funny that Donald Trump is such a goddamn liberal, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2144.8s)]
*  that he doesn't know a single thing about guns. And I think about that. I think it might've been [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2149.12s)]
*  megaphonics who said it. He just literally doesn't know a single damn thing about guns. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2154.0s)]
*  And these people do not care. Okay. He took his gun and started shooting them. He's like, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2160.32s)]
*  AK 47, you know about that. It's a serious, it's a serious gun. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2164.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know if he's, where is he? Not here, right? This guy, these guys do a great job. Now, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2169.84s)]
*  they do need more people and they've been complaining about that for a long time, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2175.44s)]
*  but he did a great job. But you want to know another sort of a miracle. So the guy is now [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2178.6400000000003s)]
*  running for his life and he's got a car a block away or whatever. And a woman, this is a woman, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2184.0s)]
*  not a man, a woman. See women are smarter than men. I hate to say, how does that sound? Our [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2189.52s)]
*  great first lady is very happy now. Let me just, let me just tell you, think of this, who would do [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2195.36s)]
*  this? I actually asked, I was with the sheriff this morning. I was with a couple of people from [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2201.28s)]
*  secret service. Who would do this? So you'd now have a man running, not with a gun. He dropped [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2205.92s)]
*  the gun. We found the gun, but he was gone. And a woman driving in a car, saw a man on the street, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2210.64s)]
*  pretty busy street running. And she followed him and he got into the car and she stopped because [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2217.52s)]
*  she thought he was trouble. He looked different. He's like trouble. She followed him. It wasn't [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2224.48s)]
*  very far and parked the car behind his car and started taking pictures of his license plate. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2231.52s)]
*  Now think of it and Sarah, think of it. No, no, seriously, who would do that? It's the women, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2237.92s)]
*  not from good or bad, not from, you know, strength or heroism. Karen's dude weaponized Karen's. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2245.44s)]
*  I see people running all the time. Snitch behavior. She saw something in this guy that was bad. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2252.16s)]
*  She may have heard maybe because there were four, I guess four, actually the guy, the team that I [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2258.16s)]
*  got off were from secret service. But think of it, who would do this? If you took a thousand of these [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2262.7200000000003s)]
*  incidents, would even one person have done it? This woman was, I haven't met her, but I'd like [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2269.04s)]
*  to meet her. I'm going to meet her, I hope. But think of this. She goes in, she takes pictures of [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2274.88s)]
*  the plate and then she sends the pictures into the sheriff's office and the sheriff's are saying, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2280.88s)]
*  wow, this is pretty amazing. And they were able to get this guy within 10 minutes at a high speed [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2286.56s)]
*  chase on the highway. They got him. Otherwise we'd probably have an AK-47. They had the camera. They [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2292.6400000000003s)]
*  had the whole, he had the whole thing. He's a sophisticated guy. He even had the serial number [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2299.92s)]
*  taken off the rifle, the gun. But think of this. So we'd have all the stuff, but I'd be walking [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2305.04s)]
*  around saying, I wonder where this guy is. Is he in this audience? We would have a maniac out there. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2310.96s)]
*  This woman was unbelievable because I actually asked the sheriff, if it happened a thousand times, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2317.36s)]
*  would anybody have done that? He said, maybe, but not much, not much. So she did a, she was [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2323.44s)]
*  really amazing. Amazing job. We're glad she did. I think there are a couple takeaways there. One, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2329.04s)]
*  the women of this country love Donald Trump and are going to make sure we do our part. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2336.24s)]
*  What was the question? Immigration. And I think one of the other question was immigration, Chad. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2341.2799999999997s)]
*  Another one of his like major, you know, this is like his thing. And he has big plans. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2346.08s)]
*  Sarah, I just want to say one thing. So when I heard about this tonight, I said, so where am I [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2351.36s)]
*  speaking? Michigan. Good. I like Michigan. I want to talk about cars. I love talking about the cars [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2357.04s)]
*  because it's so simple. It's so ridiculous that this is happening. You don't want the electric. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2361.2799999999997s)]
*  You do want electric cars, 7%, 8%. Elon makes a great product, but you know what? And I have, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2366.16s)]
*  Hey, I've driven, his car is incredible. Other cars are incredible, but you have a little thing, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2372.4s)]
*  but you want to have gasoline propelled cars. You want to have hybrids. You want to have all sorts. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2377.92s)]
*  They say a new one is going to be hydrogen. Who the hell knows? They said has a slight problem. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2382.72s)]
*  It blows up. And if you're in the car, that could be a little problem, but you want to, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2387.44s)]
*  you want to be able to have whatever it is, whatever the market is and all that stuff. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2391.68s)]
*  But they said, sir, you're having a town hall tonight. And I said a town hall. Well, what the [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2395.44s)]
*  hell they want to rally. They don't want a town hall, town hall. And I said, so who is the host [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2402.0s)]
*  because host or hostess? And they said, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. And I said, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2408.56s)]
*  that's good. I like that. But I figured Sarah, I refuse to believe this. Many people are excited [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2414.96s)]
*  to see Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the state of Michigan, let alone in her own state. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2420.72s)]
*  Okay. There's something so deeply wrong. There is like a lot of psychic damage in this room. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2426.0s)]
*  If you ever find yourself clapping for Sarah Huckabee Sanders, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2432.88s)]
*  understand that there is something very wrong has occurred in your life. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2436.96s)]
*  Something very wrong has occurred in the planet. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2441.2000000000003s)]
*  In the country harder than being president of the United States is being a mom, especially under [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2444.4s)]
*  this administration, because they're making everything harder. And tonight we have a mom [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2450.56s)]
*  here in the audience, Barbara, that's behind us that has a question for you. Hi, Barbara. Hello, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2456.7200000000003s)]
*  back there. Good evening. Good evening, President Trump. Thank you for taking our question. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2462.0s)]
*  My name is Barbara. I'm a mom of three, a grandmother of seven, and three great-grands, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2467.6s)]
*  a registered nurse, retired, retired nurse. So I know the cost that goes into raising children [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2475.68s)]
*  and running a household. People just can't survive now. How are you going to bring down [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2485.76s)]
*  the cost of food and groceries? Good. Very good. Thank you. He's not going to answer. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2492.8s)]
*  He's going to be like, they're coming. China tariffs with energy, Bagram airbase. But there's [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2499.2000000000003s)]
*  no bigger subject. It covers everything. If you make donuts, if you make cars, whatever you make, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2506.0800000000004s)]
*  energy is a big deal. And we're going to get that. It's my ambition to get your energy bill [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2511.92s)]
*  within 12 months down 50%. If I can do that, you've done a hell of a job. Five oh five, not 15, 50. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2516.88s)]
*  Interest rates are going to follow and actually they're going to follow for other reasons. The [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2524.64s)]
*  economy is now not good and interest rates, you'll see they'll do the rate cut and all the political [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2529.12s)]
*  stuff. Bro, she literally said, what are you going to do to lower grocery prices? He's like, oil. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2534.4s)]
*  Otherwise you wouldn't be able to do it. But we're going to get interest rates down and we [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2541.28s)]
*  got to work with our farmers. Our farmers are being decimated right now. They're being absolutely, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2545.28s)]
*  absolutely decimated. And you know, one of the reasons is we allow a lot of farm product into [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2551.28s)]
*  our country and we're going to have to be a little bit like other countries. We're not going to allow [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2557.0400000000004s)]
*  so much. We're going to let our farmers go to work. And I don't know if you remember, I love the [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2560.4s)]
*  farmers because, you know, I had many meetings as president. I have this gorgeous room with this [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2566.48s)]
*  beautiful table that seats about 35 people. And I was with the farmers. Usually everybody wants [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2570.8s)]
*  something. They all want subsidy. But I was with the farmers and I think you might have been there [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2576.4s)]
*  actually, Sarah. I said, look, fellows, we're going to get you such a beautiful subsidy, meaning I'm [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2581.6800000000003s)]
*  going to do things. And one of the people raises it, sir, honestly, we don't want a subsidy. This [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2586.32s)]
*  is the first time this ever happened to me. Everyone wants, they want money. They want to [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2591.84s)]
*  build windmills. We want money with these windmills. Anyway, but you know what was amazing. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2595.92s)]
*  He said almost tears in his eyes. We don't, they were getting decimated. We don't want a subsidy. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2602.08s)]
*  We just want to play, you know, a fair level playing field. And I said, that's a lie. I said, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2608.08s)]
*  nobody's ever said that. And I have many, you know, because no one ever said that different things, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2614.48s)]
*  you know, they do all different things. It's probably the most dramatic. No one has ever said [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2619.36s)]
*  that because no one told that to Trump wanted was to be able to compete fairly. And the reason, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2623.44s)]
*  the problem we have is other countries, they treat us very badly in that way. Also, they really are. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2628.4s)]
*  And, you know, sometimes the worst countries are our so-called allies. I say so-called because in [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2633.52s)]
*  many ways they're not allies at all. They take advantage of us. They really take advantage, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2638.32s)]
*  but we're going to do Americans realize that oil prices are set by OPEC. No. And the greatest [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2643.52s)]
*  example of this is when OPEC set the oil prices and Biden begged the American oil and gas giants [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2649.84s)]
*  to like increase production as a way to offset costs. They straight up went on television and said, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2654.96s)]
*  no, exactly what happened. They folded and they agreed to buy $50 billion straight up. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2662.8s)]
*  You might've heard the story. I said, how much I went to the secretary of agriculture, how much [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2670.6400000000003s)]
*  did they buy? He said 15. I thought he said 50. So when they're ready to make a deal at 15 billion, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2675.44s)]
*  I said, no, I want 50. That's what they've been buying. He said, no, it's 15. I said, you said [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2683.6s)]
*  50. What the f was the question? I forgot too. I'm not going to lie. I totally forgot. And we got it. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2688.4s)]
*  We got it. And they buy a lot of energy and common sense. A lot of it's common sense. Everything. Oh, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2694.48s)]
*  my God. Oh my God. It was groceries. It was Barbara, the retired nurse who used to be a registered [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2701.12s)]
*  nurse who retired was like, what will you do about the prices of groceries? Wheels and walls. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2707.6s)]
*  You know, if I do, there's a gorgeous computer down here in about how he lower prices. He won't [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2714.8s)]
*  friend of mine is in that business. He hates it. He said, we come up with a new model and it's that [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2720.4s)]
*  greatest about three and a half weeks later, the damn thing is totally obsolete. The only thing that [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2725.28s)]
*  never gets obsolete is a wall and a wheel. And the wall is what we're talking about now. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2730.08s)]
*  And you know, we built hundreds of miles of wall. We then added more than I ever said I was going [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2736.48s)]
*  to do. And then we had that bad election result, that disgusting result. And they never put it up. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2742.24s)]
*  You know what they did with it? They sold it for five cents and it was expensive wall. It was exactly [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2748.08s)]
*  what the border patrol wanted with the anti-climb plate on top, which I always hated because I [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2752.72s)]
*  didn't like the look of it. But you know, they demonstrated it. We had mountain climbers and a [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2757.76s)]
*  couple of drug climbers to these guys are amazing. They can, they put a hundred pounds of drugs on [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2762.6400000000003s)]
*  the back and they go up the wall like it's nothing, but they couldn't get over the plate. So all of a [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2767.2000000000003s)]
*  sudden I said, okay, I'll put the plate on. I didn't like it. I liked it better without the plate, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2771.6000000000004s)]
*  but it didn't work quite as well. So this is what we did. We had it, bro. He's still talking about [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2775.28s)]
*  grocery prices. You don't have to be a genius to know remain in Mexico is a very good thing. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2781.36s)]
*  And you think that was easy to get. I think Tijuana, Mexico was probably the fastest growing [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2786.24s)]
*  city in the history of the world. Okay. That hundreds of thousands, they couldn't come in. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2791.6s)]
*  When they got in, they let everybody pour into our country. The border, just to finish with the [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2796.16s)]
*  border. When I talk about energy, to me, it's exciting, but to a lot of people, it's not, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2801.04s)]
*  but it gets exciting because we'll bring down your costs, all that. But what people want to hear, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2805.92s)]
*  and I believe when I got elected, I believe it was the border. There was the biggest thing and [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2810.3199999999997s)]
*  I fixed it and I did a great job. And I wanted to mention it in 2020. And my people would say, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2814.32s)]
*  sir, nobody cares about the border. They don't care because I had it fixed. Now I got to fix it [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2819.36s)]
*  again. I believe the border is of the greatest interest. When you look at, when you look at, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2824.4s)]
*  when you look at what's happening in Aurora, okay. Take a look at Aurora. When you look at [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2830.2400000000002s)]
*  what's happening in Ohio, the great state of Ohio, I love it. I'm way the hell up. I wish I was up [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2835.76s)]
*  18 points in your state, but we are up. We are up. I think when people hear what I have to say, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2842.08s)]
*  I don't know how you can possibly lose it. You, I'll tell you this and I'll say this for Michigan. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2847.6s)]
*  If I don't win, you will have no auto industry within two to three years. It'll all be gone. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2852.96s)]
*  And I know you've got a little bit of an increase. It doesn't mean that's the small stuff because [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2859.2s)]
*  it's just a temporary thing because you will not have any manufacturing plants. China is going to [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2863.2799999999997s)]
*  take over all of your business because of the electric car and because they have the material. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2868.4s)]
*  We don't, what we have is a thing called the gasoline. We have gasoline. We have so much [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2873.44s)]
*  gasoline. We don't know what to do. They don't have gasoline. So why are we making a product [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2877.84s)]
*  that they dominate? They're going to dominate. You will not have a car industry left, not even [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2882.88s)]
*  a little bit of a car industry. So, and you're going to have electric cars, but you're going to [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2888.8s)]
*  have 7%. You're going to have 9%, whatever it may be. And maybe someday the technology becomes so [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2893.28s)]
*  good that you can do more. I mean, you know, it's fine. But right now the battery technology [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2899.84s)]
*  isn't there for long term. I always say, I love the electric car, but they don't go far enough. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2904.4s)]
*  And they don't do well. You know, in Iowa, it was 20 degrees below zero when we had our great success [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2909.52s)]
*  in Iowa. We had a great, and there were cars all over the place. I said, what's wrong with those [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2914.96s)]
*  cars? They don't work well in cold and they don't work very well in heat, but Elon's going to figure [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2919.2s)]
*  it out. Cause he's great. He gave me the greatest endorsement. He, he figures everything out. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2924.8799999999997s)]
*  Right now he's got other things to think. He's got to get a rocket up to get to them. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2930.24s)]
*  I said, Elon, let's get going. No, they're relying on. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2935.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm transitioning from your dad to your mom. I'm both now. I'm also transitioning to the top of [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2939.2s)]
*  the hour ad break, baby. After I'm done topping your dad and topping your mom, I'm going to serve [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2944.64s)]
*  the top of the hour ad break, which comes to the top of the hour. You no longer want to see those [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2950.3199999999997s)]
*  ads. All you need to do is subscribe for $6 or for free. Here's the three minute ad break now, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2954.64s)]
*  bitch. I'm a local contractor in this town. He's a cool looking guy. I'm a local contractor in [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2961.12s)]
*  this town and I live here my whole life. And I'm going to tell you, I'm kind of concerned about [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2966.16s)]
*  crucial Kamala's tax increase. Can you outline for the people what you plan on doing about taxes? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2971.84s)]
*  Great. It's a great question. Look, she's going to double up your taxes. She wants to terminate [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2978.7200000000003s)]
*  Wow. Tax cut. Just that is going to finally answer the question directly. That's weird. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2983.1200000000003s)]
*  That one more. I mean, he's lying, but still I have it so that like, if you're a farmer or a [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2988.48s)]
*  small business, that's how you set the expectations low. They're going to give everything. You know, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2993.36s)]
*  a lot of people don't realize I've been, a lot of people didn't talk about it, but if you have a [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=2997.68s)]
*  small business, if you have a farm someplace, a lot of farmers, they have beautiful land, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3002.88s)]
*  but they don't have the cash and they leave it to their children and they're so proud of their [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3006.96s)]
*  children and the children end up going bankrupt because they have to borrow money to pay off the [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3010.24s)]
*  estate tax. There is no estate tax and that's something that nobody even talks about, but [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3015.44s)]
*  that's helped. That's saved a lot of families from having to sell their farm or losing their farm. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3020.96s)]
*  But she's got one thing that's incredible and unrealized capital gain tax that will drive [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3027.92s)]
*  every business out of the United States. So what that is is I don't know how they can possibly [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3034.88s)]
*  administer. The only ones that are going to make money are appraisers and accountants. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3040.96s)]
*  So they're taking a business might not have a lot of money, but it might have great land [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3045.6s)]
*  and they're valuing it. And what was it this year compared to next year? You got to put down a [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3050.0s)]
*  value and then you got to go out and you have to pay tax even though you haven't sold anything. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3054.8s)]
*  It's the craziest thing I've ever heard and I don't know how any rich person or any person [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3058.8s)]
*  that's in business can even think of supporting her. It's the craziest thing I've ever heard. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3064.5600000000004s)]
*  So and they're going to raise the capital gains tax really a lot. Now as far as regular people [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3069.92s)]
*  are going to have to pay a lot more tax. Your taxes she said 70 to 80 percent. Some people will pay [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3076.1600000000003s)]
*  70 80 percent. You have to understand a lot of these people are international business people. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3081.44s)]
*  A lot of these companies are international. They don't care if they're here or someplace else. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3086.56s)]
*  They go for the best deal. They go for their shareholders. If they raise the taxes like that, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3090.64s)]
*  they go to other countries. You don't understand every auto worker has 13.6 million dollars [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3095.92s)]
*  saved up by the time they die, which is why the estate tax is really a big deal for them. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3102.16s)]
*  These are all regular auto workers. It's funny because like they're obviously not regular old [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3107.68s)]
*  auto workers. Maybe some of them are like jet ski dealership owners or whatever. But like [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3113.36s)]
*  most of those people are still absolutely not hitting the tax bracket that Trump is talking [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3117.7599999999998s)]
*  about. But they're over here going crazy. They're like hell yeah brother. Thank you. Please, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3125.6s)]
*  please give more tax breaks to Elon Musk and Jeffrey Bezos. I love them. And mark my words, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3132.48s)]
*  if for some reason some tragedy happens, because it would be a tragedy beyond the auto business [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3140.3199999999997s)]
*  for the whole country. I really believe that if a tragedy happens and we don't win, there will be [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3145.2799999999997s)]
*  zero car jobs, manufacturing jobs. It will all be out of here. And that includes South Carolina. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3150.8799999999997s)]
*  That includes other places that are competitors of yours. You won't be making cars here anymore. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3156.56s)]
*  You won't be making anything in our country anymore. We're going to bring it all back. But [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3161.52s)]
*  the one and I say this and I said it to another state the other night and I said this is not a [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3165.52s)]
*  good thing to say to another state. But I said Michigan's going to be the most fun because you [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3170.88s)]
*  have you're so set up for greatness. All you need is somebody smart at the top to say you can't [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3175.92s)]
*  flood our market with cars. You just can't do it. And if I say you have to pay 100 percent, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3182.4s)]
*  you know China pays a big but I didn't do the big number yet. But if I say you have to pay 100 or [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3189.44s)]
*  200 percent, it doesn't matter. Because I'm going to say second sense. I hope you don't mind this. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3194.56s)]
*  However, if you build your plant in Detroit or if you build it in Michigan or if you build it [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3200.2400000000002s)]
*  anywhere in the United States for that matter, it seems to be the right location. But we're going [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3205.36s)]
*  to have more fun. So I'm telling them about Michigan and I'm saying, you know, this story [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3210.48s)]
*  is getting a little bit long because I'm talking about Michigan. I happen to be in another state, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT0hOuiEy4&t=3215.04s)]
