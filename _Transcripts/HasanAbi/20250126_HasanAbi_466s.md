*  flights. Yeah. So I guess the point at contention here is the military plane being used. So [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=16.52s)]
*  he was like, we don't want military planes to be used. You need to use civilian planes [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=23.6s)]
*  and commercial aircraft. You can't use military planes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=27.8s)]
*  All right. Let's get to the news. The sun's coming out. Jesus Christ. Here on live now [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=30.88s)]

*  Trump is now ordering action to be taken against the country of Columbia saying, quote, I was [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=45.96s)]
*  informed that two repatriation flights from the United States with a large number of illegal [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=52.56s)]
*  criminals were not allowed to land in Columbia. This order was given to a president who is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=58.68s)]
*  already very unpopular amongst his people, his denial of what a funny thing to say while [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=65.16s)]
*  you're in the process of like enforcing your will upon this person. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=71.64s)]
*  Like I find this, I find this kind of funny where he's like, Oh, this like stupid ass [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=78.4s)]
*  socialist president. Nobody likes them. Okay. Well your actions are probably even less popular [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=85.12s)]
*  from the perspective of Colombians where you're like, Hey, these, these people that have done [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  crimes in the United States of America, they're your responsibility now. Like I suspect that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=98.68s)]
*  the Colombian president saying no to that, saying no to this, like deportation, like [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  saying no to receiving these, these deported people is probably somewhat a popular move, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=112.91999999999999s)]
*  right? Like who the fuck is like, Oh yeah, please give me all the criminals that did [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  crimes in your country. You don't have to like directly send them in the way that Trump [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=123.0s)]
*  claims that is how it goes. But Oh my God, my fucking hair. I'm going to, I'm just going [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=127.28s)]
*  to jump in. They said no, because it was a military plane. Okay. I got you tripping on [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=132.92s)]
*  the hair. No. When I wake up in the mornings, my hair just looks like dog. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=139.52s)]
*  This flights has jeopardized the national security and public safety of the United States. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QCLCLVgy8&t=143.2s)]
