# U.S. Foreign Policy Is A Disaster | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs)
*  Also, that's not even true. There is a tremendous amount of trade happening in the red sea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=0.0s)]
*  Again, if you actually look at the, if you actually look at the ships that are passing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=5.14s)]
*  through, they're just Russian ships and Chinese ships that the Houthis are allowing to pass [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=9.14s)]
*  through. And I'm certain that some of those ships are going to Israel for the record. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=15.72s)]
*  Like there's no way that Russian ships and Chinese ships are not going through the red [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=21.1s)]
*  sea. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=28.1s)]
*  We're close, but we're not close enough. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=34.42s)]
*  Let's talk about what we've heard from and seen from President Trump online, who now [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=36.18s)]
*  says he wants to deal with President Putin quote differently through banking or secondary [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=40.7s)]
*  sanctions. Will President Trump follow through with imposing new sanctions against Russia? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  Well, first of all, I'm not going to, the president, we have multiple options, frankly, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=52.86s)]
*  to address this and to deal with all of this, but we don't want to get to that point. This [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=57.02s)]
*  is still not the time. I think what the president is saying and has been saying for some time [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=60.5s)]
*  now is he is aware that he has these options. People ask him about it all the time, but [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=64.22s)]
*  what he really wants is a peace deal. He wants the dying and the to stop. This is a terrible [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=68.86s)]
*  war. It's cost the lives of thousands of people, billions of dollars and generational destruction [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=74.06s)]
*  on the Ukrainian side. We want the war to end. You saw yesterday at the Pope's mass, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=79.26s)]
*  it was talk about war and how it needed to stop the Pope, the late Pope who's celebrated [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=84.38s)]
*  for being a peacemaker and trying to talk about these things. We should all be happy [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=89.02s)]
*  that we have a president of the United States and Donald J. Trump who wants to end and prevent [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=93.38s)]
*  wars. And that's what we're trying to do here. Ultimately, look, if it doesn't happen, it [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=97.78s)]
*  doesn't come to fruition, then as a nation state, there are options that we have for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  those who we hold responsible for not wanting the peace. But we'd prefer not to get to that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  stage yet because we think it closes the door to diplomacy. Well, you know, the president [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  has made a number of demands against Ukraine. Just last month, the president told me he [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=113.58s)]
*  might impose penalties against Russia. I guess given the frustrations that he is voicing, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=118.42s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, why hasn't he imposed sanctions yet? Well, because I think we're still hoping [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  to see that this effort works out in diplomacy and that we can bring these two sides closer [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=129.18s)]
*  together. I mean, the minute you start doing that kind of stuff, you're walking away from [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=134.06s)]
*  it. You're walking away from it. You've now doomed yourself to another two years of war [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=137.86s)]
*  and we don't want to see it happen. I think what's important and really weighs is there [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=141.66s)]
*  is no other country, there is no other institution or organization on the earth that can bring [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=145.5s)]
*  these two sides together. No one else is talking to both sides but us. And no one else in the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=150.06s)]
*  world can make something like this happen but the president. This is a very significant [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  responsibility and a really important opportunity. And we want to make sure that we work it all [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  the way through, that we don't walk away from something that can actually work or that can [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=163.77999999999997s)]
*  lead to peace, but we also don't want to continue to spend time on something that's not going [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=168.9s)]
*  to get us there. So throughout this process it's about determining do both sides really [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  want peace and how close are they or how far apart they are after 90 days of effort here, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=177.22000000000003s)]
*  over 90 days of effort. That's what we're trying to determine this week. There are reasons [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=182.54000000000002s)]
*  to be optimistic and there are also reasons to be concerned. It's complicated if this [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=186.3s)]
*  was an easy war to end, it would have been ended by someone else a long time ago, but [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=190.58s)]
*  right now the only one who can bring these two sides together to end this war is our [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=194.22000000000003s)]
*  president, President Trump, and we're doing everything we can to see if we can get that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=197.86s)]
*  done here over the next few days. Let me ask you about some of the language you've taken. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=201.78s)]
*  Just three years ago you co-sponsored a Senate bill barring the United States from recognizing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=206.34s)]
*  Russian claims to any portion of Ukraine's land. Let me read you part of what you said, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  quote, Vladimir Putin is the real aggressor in this war and he is attempting an unjustified [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=217.9s)]
*  of a sovereign democratic country. The United States cannot recognize Putin's claims or [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=223.82s)]
*  we risk established. Damn. I mean, why you gotta, why do you gotta go and do that? Why [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=229.5s)]
*  you gotta go and show old takes? That was before I was a part of the Trump admin. You [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=234.5s)]
*  know what I mean? That's it's kind of up pushing a dangerous precedent for other authoritarian [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  regimes like the Chinese communist party to imitate. What message does it send to China [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=245.78s)]
*  and other adversaries if the United States allows Russia to keep the land it's illegally [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=251.06s)]
*  claimed? Well, first of all, I would say that right now there's a lot of press reports about [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=257.34s)]
*  this, that, or these concessions or that concessions. A lot of things have been discussed and the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=261.34s)]
*  reason why those things are being discussed is very simple. Not because we're going to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=264.74s)]
*  force anyone to do anything or pressure anyone to do anything like this, but because we need [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=267.86s)]
*  to understand what are the options to bringing about an end to the war. We need to be grown [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=272.14s)]
*  up some realistic here and any negotiated end to a war, both sides get something and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=276.98s)]
*  both sides have to give something up. That's a reality without speaking specifically about [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  that or another. You wrote that you talk about that was back in September of 2022. Since [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=284.82s)]
*  September of 2022, this war has continued. Thousands of more people have died, generational [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=290.16s)]
*  destruction that Ukraine's going to spend two generations rebuilding from. This is a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=295.98s)]
*  war that needs to end now. And so in order for this war to end, there are things Russia [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=300.22s)]
*  wants that it will not get. And there are things Ukraine wants that it will not get. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=304.3s)]
*  If it wasn't the case, that would have been done a long time ago. No one here is claiming [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=307.98s)]
*  that one side is going to unconditionally surrender to the other and bring this to an [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=311.18s)]
*  end. But that's why diplomacy can be difficult and time consuming. But it is the only way [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=314.74s)]
*  to end this conflict. There is no military solution to this war. The only solution to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=319.78s)]
*  this war. The only, the only way to go about this 100% is to bring China to the table. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=324.06s)]
*  Revolutionary talk from CCB agent, Mark Carney, just as any revolution needs his children [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=329.62s)]
*  unchecked market. Fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=335.06s)]
*  term dynamism of capitalism itself. Market fundamentalism, the belief in the power of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=338.5s)]
*  the market, the self correct to allocate resource efficiently and to serve the public interest [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=342.94s)]
*  has led to a world where he worshiped the altar of the market. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=346.82s)]
*  Okay. I think that was literally the Pope that said that by the way, like the former [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=350.1s)]
*  That was not Mark Carney. That was Pope Francis chatter is with you. That was literally a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=356.26s)]
*  quote from Mark Carney. I'm not joking. I'm almost certain that this was, wait, isn't [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=361.98s)]
*  this literally what the Pope said? Hold on. Oh my God. Wait, he did say it. Hold on. This [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=367.22s)]
*  is from a book, just money, how Catholic social teaching can redeem capitalism. Okay. I mean, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=373.7s)]
*  it's still like social democratic thought, I guess, but let's see market fun, market [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=381.7s)]
*  fundamentalism, sometimes called neoliberalism drill, the world economy, the enormous dammit. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=389.38s)]
*  No, that's not the one Mark Carney, governor of the bank of England said in the summer [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=393.74s)]
*  of 2014, just as any revolution eats his children, unchecked market fundamentalism can devour [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=397.86s)]
*  the social capital essential for the longterm dynamism of capitalism itself. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=403.46s)]
*  Mark Carney. Yeah, I mean, maybe he's a Keynesian economist. Maybe that's why Jeff Sachs likes [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=408.5s)]
*  him. Also, he's not going to be even remotely socialist. Don't be delusional, please. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=413.54s)]
*  Wars and negotiated settlement, where both sides are going to have to give up something [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=417.54s)]
*  they claim to want, and are going to have to give the other side something they wish [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=420.86s)]
*  they didn't. That's how you end wars. And that's what we're trying to achieve here. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=424.04s)]
*  So more people won't die. There are people who will die today in this war, because there [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=428.26s)]
*  is no peace. We don't want to continue to have to say that every time you turn on the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=433.1s)]
*  news and they say, well, another missile strike, another, all these things will continue to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=437.14s)]
*  happen. This could get even worse in the months. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=441.06s)]
*  Meanwhile, an F 18, I believe was downed by accident due to the Houthis consistently [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=443.21999999999997s)]
*  pressuring the American Navy by simply existing and becoming, I guess, you know, robust bombing [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=454.5s)]
*  targets. An F a 18 fighter jet and tow tractor fell overboard the USS Harry Truman today [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=465.18s)]
*  and a sunk in the Red Sea per the Navy. A US official said that initial reports from [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=472.86s)]
*  the scene indicated that the Truman made a hard turn to evade Houthi fire, which contributed [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=478.42s)]
*  to the fighter jet falling overboard. A $70 million baby. That's a add that to the toll [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=482.1s)]
*  after losing 21 MQ nine Reaper drones, $30 million a pop, I believe the U S has now lost [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=489.3s)]
*  an F 18 jet in a failing war to defend Israel's ability to commit genocide in Gaza. The U [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=495.58s)]
*  S has failed to restore freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, can not suppress Yemeni missiles [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=500.18s)]
*  or drones and is massacring civilians. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=503.86s)]
*  Also that's not even true. There is a tremendous amount of trade happening in the Red Sea. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=507.54s)]
*  Again, if you actually look at the, if you actually look at the ships that are passing [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=511.58s)]
*  through, they're just Russian ships and Chinese ships that the Houthis are allowing to pass [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=515.58s)]
*  through. And I'm certain that some of those ships are going to Israel for the record. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=522.14s)]
*  Like there's no way that Russian ships and Chinese ships are not going through the Red [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=527.5s)]
*  Sea. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=534.5s)]
*  I'm waiting for onslaught. A lot of fish it out and sent to Iran for cloning Yemeni F [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=535.5s)]
*  18s in 10 years, like the beast of Kandahar. I doubt that that'll happen. They go to ports [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=538.98s)]
*  closer to Egypt and unload the cargo there. Yeah, here, here is the Marine vessel traffic. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=544.3s)]
*  Turkish crew on board destination, Singapore destination Suez zoom to China, please. What [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=551.9s)]
*  do you mean compare us to China ports? I mean, there's still a ton of traffic. The tactic [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=558.9s)]
*  of not trying to beat the U S but just make them, but it's unbeatable. Not going to lie. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=564.38s)]

*  We're waiting and conservatives up to that. Let me let me fast forward to the future. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=695.64s)]
*  I hope to see. Right across the country. But we will see. Right. This is early. What we're [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=700.64s)]
*  going to see now is a whole lot more data coming in. I'm going to go quickly. Just [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=706.64s)]
*  like 30 seconds to you. The only interesting thing with the vote is going away that common [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=709.64s)]
*  wisdom would suggest this is way down by about four percentage points by the numbers. It's [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=711.76s)]
*  all down to Jonathan Robes. As has the People's Party vote in this writing the Bullarm Fabrication [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=714.04s)]
*  yard that built the Hibernia project. There's an oil refinery there. So it's trades people [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=718.88s)]
*  and and traditional offshore industrial base. So the NDP class is more that blue orange [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=723.6s)]
*  thing rather than the orange red. So that's how it's playing out at least right now. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=728.94s)]
*  That's what Jason Kenney was warning us about or telling us about. Yeah. Okay. Good. So [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=732.7800000000001s)]
*  a good thing to keep in mind as we get ready to bring you a whole lot more information [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=736.5400000000001s)]
*  this is where the bulk of your votes are going to be counted now almost nine thirty eastern [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=741.34s)]
*  polls are going to close between Quebec all the way to the Rocky Mountains and two territories. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=746.1s)]
*  This is when your say will start to determine who is going to form government as we come [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=751.72s)]
*  out of Atlantic Canada you can see where the results are at the bottom of your screen [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=756.5s)]
*  polls now close in much of the country. Polls have now closed in most of Canada and that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=759.9s)]
*  means we're about to get the biggest waves of results we'll get tonight from Quebec Ontario [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=766.72s)]
*  Manitoba Saskatchewan Alberta the Northwest Territories and Nunavut 266 more seats will [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=772.44s)]
*  be added to the count. Many of these are key battlegrounds of this election writings you [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=779.8s)]
*  need to win to form government. Okay so that is what is to come let's look at where we [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=784.76s)]
*  are to Canada the Liberals leading and elected in 22 the Conservatives with 10 and the block [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=793.4s)]
*  there we're not going to talk too much about it we believe some early results were put [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=800.0s)]
*  in for one riding in Quebec but there is one riding where the block is leading and that's [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=803.56s)]
*  in Gaspésie-les-Medelins but you can see there this is not exactly the way the Liberals [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=808.06s)]
*  wanted the evening to start it's an encouraging sign for the Conservatives but remember it [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=813.4s)]
*  was just three months ago that the Liberals thought that they were kind of hopeless not [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=818.48s)]
*  only informing government but certainly in losing a lot of seats in Atlantic Canada so [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=822.52s)]
*  that is part of the story as well the recovery of the Liberals that we've seen after Mark [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  Carney took over Ian Henemancik. There are two ridings in New Brunswick right now where [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=831.12s)]
*  our decision desk is not in a position where it can project a win and one of them is Miramichi [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=835.48s)]
*  Grand Lake we told you at the beginning of the evening that this could be close it is [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=841.86s)]
*  the one riding that four years ago flipped in that case from the Liberals to the Conservatives [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=845.82s)]
*  the lead has gone back and forth and as you can see just 472 is the lead for Mike Dawson [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=850.46s)]
*  over Lisa Harris and the other one I want to show you which is still in play is Mattawaska [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=856.94s)]
*  Restigouche still lead here for the Liberals but the last you know one of the interesting [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=862.74s)]
*  things when you look at the numbers here for Mattawaska Restigouche is that the Liberal [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=868.6s)]
*  candidate is not the incumbent is performing at about the same level that Renee Arsenault [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=872.4s)]
*  did the last three times it is the Conservative vote that has really surged compared to last [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=877.5600000000001s)]
*  time and so relatively close closer I think Rosemary than a lot of people expected so [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=883.2s)]
*  these are the two ridings in New Brunswick which are still at this point in the evening [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=888.36s)]
*  in play. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=892.6s)]
*  Thank you for that Ian polls now closed in an additional 266 ridings meaning that we [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=893.9200000000001s)]
*  are going to get a lot of information very quickly about where Canadians are at want [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=901.32s)]
*  to bring in at issue if I can just for a moment to get a sense Chantal of what you're going [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=905.4s)]
*  to watch for now as so many more polls have now closed. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=910.32s)]
*  Well obviously what happens to the Black Quebecois vote whether it's going to be down as was [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=913.72s)]
*  predicted or whether the block will hold its ground the only writing that we actually have [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=920.12s)]
*  numbers for Gaspésie Lysée de la Madeleine and I'm not even sure that we're getting [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=925.32s)]
*  the entire numbers because a section of the writing is actually on the same time zone [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=929.76s)]
*  in the same time zone as the rest of Quebec I see so but this writing which we will get [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=937.8s)]
*  a result more definitive result early is significant it's actually two writings because [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=943.64s)]
*  of redistribution a former black writing and a liberal held writing so someone is going [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=950.24s)]
*  to lose a seat here and if the black keeps the seat as opposed to the liberals it may [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=956.28s)]
*  be that they'll have a better night than they would have otherwise but the big area [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=962.56s)]
*  for the liberals is in and around Montreal and that is also true of the black with some [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=967.72s)]
*  battles in Quebec City mostly against conservatives. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=976.32s)]
*  Okay I'm going to come back to you Andrew in just a minute but Ian's got some results [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=980.24s)]
*  because you can see the numbers on your screen moving there. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=983.2s)]
*  Yeah counting super quickly in Battleford's Lloyd Minster Meadow Lake in Saskatchewan [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=985.44s)]
*  we already have a few of the votes counted and there are a couple of things that are [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=990.72s)]
*  notable about the results to this point first of all this is a writing where you'd expect [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=995.08s)]
*  Rosemary Falk to go to win she has already and her vote vote share in 2019 was 78 percent [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1000.8s)]
*  in 2021 69 percent and it's even greater at this point it's in the 80 percentage range [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1008.04s)]
*  and one of the reasons for that may be that Meadow Lake Saskatchewan is now part of this [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1014.04s)]
*  writing a lot of conservative supporters there and I mentioned Meadow Lake because it used [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1019.2s)]
*  to be part of the Desnethe Missounepe Churchill River riding the fact that it's now moved [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1023.6s)]
*  in redistribution Rosemary is good news potentially for the liberals it makes that more likely [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1029.24s)]
*  a place where the liberals could pick up and the liberals have not won a seat in Saskatchewan [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1035.76s)]
*  since 2015 the the conservatives have won all of the Saskatchewan writings in 2019 and [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1041.28s)]
*  2021. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1049.24s)]
*  Catherine Collin I believe has some early results. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1050.24s)]
*  We've got some early results coming in from Quebec let's start with a new writing Les Pays [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1052.2s)]
*  d'en-haut where you can see Rosemary this is an area now again only two polls reporting [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1056.2s)]
*  but based on redistribution this is an area we'd expect to go block but the liberals have [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1062.2s)]
*  a candidate a local mayor in the riding who is going to have a little bit of name recognition [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1066.4s)]
*  let's move on to Chico Temi Le Fior this is a block conservative fight so interesting [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1070.4s)]
*  to see the liberals in the middle of that mix but again only one poll reporting we [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1076.28s)]
*  will move on to Terban where the block incumbent Natalie Sinclair Dengenye is in the lead and [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1082.04s)]
*  another really exciting riding to watch. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1088.04s)]
*  Oh so exciting. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1090.04s)]
*  President Putin has never acknowledged Ukraine's right to exist so why do you trust that he [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1091.04s)]
*  won't invade Ukraine again or another European country? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1102.32s)]
*  I don't think peace deals are built on trust I think peace deals have to be built on verification [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1109.8400000000001s)]
*  have to be built on facts have to be built on action have to be built on realities so this is [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1113.8400000000001s)]
*  not an issue of trust it's an issue of building in these sorts of things verification security [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1118.8400000000001s)]
*  guarantees things that have been discussed in the past all these things are being talked about [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1124.64s)]
*  here all of these things but right now it's not the time if we're trying to bring two sides [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1128.44s)]
*  together the last thing you want to do is give some side one of the two sides an excuse to walk [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1133.64s)]
*  away from this effort we're just trying to achieve peace at the end of day let me remind everybody [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1139.04s)]
*  what we are trying to do is end a war that has cost a lot of money to us to our allies cost a lot [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1143.04s)]
*  of lives destroyed a lot of lives forced people by the millions to leave their country millions of [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1148.44s)]
*  Ukrainians that no longer live in the country and have not been able to come back we just want all [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1153.24s)]
*  this to stop and we're trying to find whether we can play a role to make that happen I hope [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1157.44s)]
*  everyone should hope that we're successful instead of rooting against President Trump everyone [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1161.84s)]
*  should be hopeful that President Trump can bring this war to an end because it truly at this point [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1166.44s)]
*  is not good for anybody it may not work out peace deals are hard but we are trying and I think the [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1170.44s)]
*  president deserves credit for spending this much time and this much energy and and these many [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1175.44s)]
*  resources to try to bring about this this outcome of peace all right mr. secretary let's turn to [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1180.24s)]
*  China and the president's trade war president Trump said he has spoken directly with President [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1185.48s)]
*  Xi Jinping Chinese officials though say that no talks have taken place about a trade war can you [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maza86n6vYs&t=1190.88s)]
