*  resistance groups are going to exist as a direct consequence of the much larger much greater evil [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  of Israel and the United States of America it is the reality you don't have to agree with all of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=128.04s)]
*  their methods or even their domestic affairs but the reality of the matter is like if you don't [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=134.51999999999998s)]

*  the state that's the doing the apartheid and also doing it on top of that it's the state doing the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=177.48s)]
*  apartheid and doing the okay yeah violence begins violence there's going to be an inevitable [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=182.28s)]
*  reaction to the 76 years of occupation it's no different than demanding that you condemn the Nat [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=187.24s)]
*  Turner rebellion or demanding that you condemn the Haitian revolution demanding that you condemn the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=192.84s)]

*  it's just a way to try and desperately move the conversation back into a place where Israel is [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=206.12s)]
*  seemingly the victim it's bullshit yeah kneecap lame sellout pussies okay everybody needs to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=214.04s)]

*  violence because it's a violent misanthropic system any human being living under at some [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=424.52s)]
*  point will either die a terrible silent death or rebel and often take innocent people with them [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=433.88s)]
*  the criminals here are not hamas not even the israeli settlers who are palestinians [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=443.47999999999996s)]

*  and not the occupiers so this is so funny it would be like i know is objectively cowardly to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=487.72s)]

*  role in i don't know the the israeli regime like many people don't realize that the dynamic is when [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=503.08000000000004s)]
*  you're a public figure the dynamic is obviously different you have to play a a balanced role [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=512.04s)]

*  just like it's literally the same thing the reason why you don't say that in your place of work [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=523.72s)]
*  is for the same reasons why they had them back down you know what i mean and and that is when [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=530.2s)]
*  they as artists they have a lot more leeway but they're still still artists who are in the uk [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=535.32s)]

*  made i know a distressingly large number of arabs that support hamas because they harm jews yeah [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlE9l_L2MvI&t=556.3599999999999s)]
