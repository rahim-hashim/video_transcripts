# Anti-Semitism Scandals Are Getting Crazy | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA)
*  his knees, hands up in the air. I think it was a, a former policeman or was literally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=0.0s)]
*  a, I think currently a cop or he was just like an off duty cop or something. Okay. And [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  this dude went up and with his w when he was on his knees with his hands in the air, speaking [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=14.76s)]
*  in Hebrew, saying he's Jewish. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=21.66s)]
*  All right, let's talk about South Florida. South Florida man shot two Israelis. Cops say. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=24.6s)]
*  Now this is somewhat of a ridiculous story because initially, initially they thought [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=34.2s)]
*  that the two Israelis were shot. They thought that they were shot by someone who is of Palestinian [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=42.84s)]
*  descent. Okay. The victims who were Israeli tourists right after being shot took the social media, the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=50.76s)]
*  chant to Arabs. Okay. Anyway, let's watch the story and let's figure out if it was actually a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=57.28s)]
*  Palestinian person who shot these Israeli tourists. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=63.96s)]
*  You'll only see on local 10 to more than a dozen times while driving on Miami beach. Tonight we [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=66.56s)]
*  hear from those victims. Local 10 crime specialist, Bridget Matters live on Miami beach with the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=72.92s)]
*  exclusive Bridget. And it's truly a miracle that these two were not seriously hurt. They say that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=78.08s)]
*  while they were driving, they were randomly attacked a man shooting off as many as 17 shots at [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=85.6s)]
*  their car. This is the mug shot for 27 year old Mordecai Brafman. He's accused of shooting at two [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=92.16s)]
*  men in my, I'm glad I, I'm glad I preface this with, with the guys were like, Oh, Palestinian [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=99.88s)]
*  terrorists attacked us, which is crazy because the article itself, I think like what they posted it [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=108.84s)]
*  that literally features a guy who shot them and his name is Mordecai, which is not a common [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  Palestinian name. Okay. Just gonna put that out there. All right. Mordecai Brafman 28. Why does [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=125.08s)]
*  he look so smug in the mug shot? I do not know. Oh, I think he thought that they were Palestinian too. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=134.36s)]
*  Miami beach. That's the reason. Ironically enough evening, there was a truck passing next to him. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=141.96s)]
*  Yeah, they know. He just randomly started shooting it. Ari Rive was shot in the shoulder. He spoke [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=147.96s)]
*  to us with help from his cousin to translate. He says he and his father were randomly attacked [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=155.4s)]
*  while driving off Alton road, the two visiting from Israel video shows their car riddled with [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=160.52s)]
*  bullets. Police say 17 shots were fired. He put the window down from the driver's seat and just [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=166.44s)]
*  blasted them. Ari was hit in the shoulder. The bullet still lodged in his body following the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=172.92s)]
*  attack after they took off. He tried shooting them from the back of their car. Bullet went through [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  right next to him, right next to his ear because he was the driver and him. He was holding his [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  dad's head because he thought that that got shot in the head. Surveillance video shows the men [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  trying to get help from a nearby business. The suspect was quickly arrested and the arrest [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  form it says Brafman. He saw two Palestinians and shot and killed both. That's why he has that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=200.44s)]
*  f**king smug ass face in the mug shot by the way. It is literally the real life Spiderman pointing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=206.6s)]
*  finger at each other meme. This dude, okay, this dude thought he saw a bunch of Mizrahi Jews, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=214.44s)]
*  okay, who were literally visiting from Israel and thought, oh, look at these goddamn Arabs [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=221.88s)]
*  they must be Palestinian Arabs. They must be, they must be Muslims. And he just started in the most [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=230.76s)]
*  Florida man way possible blasting. Yeah. 17 shots, 17 close range shots and only one hit his IDF for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=238.44s)]
*  sure. Oh yeah. Yeah. My man said, Oh my bad. I thought we were in f**king the West bank. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=245.24s)]
*  He said to himself, sorry, I was going to spit, but it was too far for me to spit. And some of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=253.16s)]
*  the spittle might actually get caught in my own car. So I chose the blast instead. The other side [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=259.56s)]
*  of the story that's crazy is they also thought that the dude shooting them was Palestinian or Arab. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=265.72s)]
*  My father and I went through a murder attempt against anti-Semitic background. They tried to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=273.96s)]
*  murder us in the heart of Miami, but the creator of the world is with us. So he didn't go. I want [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=277.8s)]
*  to say thank you to everyone for their support. And it is not taken for granted with Israel live [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=282.36s)]
*  to the Arabs. Y'all are so brain dead, dude. What an insane situation. Now I don't know if [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=288.12s)]
*  Mordecai Brafman is Israeli or if he's a homegrown American Zionist sociopath. Okay. But we at least [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=296.2s)]
*  know the victims were Israeli, but it doesn't change the reality that both of the parties [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=308.36s)]
*  involved thought the other party was Arab. Well, I guess the Israelis were Arab. They were Arab [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=314.36s)]
*  Jews, but you know, that doesn't stop them from not thinking they're Arab ethnically and then saying [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=319.56s)]
*  to the Arabs regardless. Oh my God. So is anybody Arab in this scenario? Technically the Israeli, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=326.12s)]
*  the Israelis that are visiting are Arab Jews. But of course, if you say that, then they get very [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=333.24s)]
*  mad at you because sorry, that's just how it is. It is the Zionism is a ethno religious supremacist [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=338.76s)]
*  attitude that dictates that if you're Jewish and Arab, then you're not Arab. Arab is a pejorative. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=346.92s)]
*  Mordecai is an American pro-Israel supporter. Oh, this is one of our boys. Okay. He's a homegrown, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=352.84s)]
*  makes sense. Pro American pro-Israel supporter fired 17 rounds at a father and a son in Miami [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=360.52s)]
*  Beach, wounding both believing he had them. He reportedly told the police I killed two Palestinians. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=365.4s)]
*  Yeah. He thought he shot and killed them. The suspect was quickly arrested and the arrest [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  form it says Brafman told detectives he saw two Palestinians and shot and killed both the victims [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=376.2s)]
*  and the suspect. Father and son say it was a miracle. Neither were seriously hurt. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=382.67999999999995s)]
*  The same. God gave him life as a gift and he's still alive. So he's happy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=387.0s)]
*  The two say they're thankful for a security guard at one of those businesses that helped them and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=398.12s)]
*  called 911. As for the suspect, he's facing a second degree attempted murder charge. We're [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=404.68s)]
*  live on Miami Beach tonight. Bridget matter, locals, hand news, incredible stuff, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=410.6s)]
*  incredible stuff. Like what do I say about this? This is the type of shit Mordecai was on. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=415.24s)]
*  Mordecai Brafman follows only eight people on Instagram. This is one of the, this is one of them, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=423.64s)]
*  the Jewish marksman and account promoting Jewish vigilantism, proud Jew husband, father and serious [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=429.0s)]
*  American firearm shredding and guidance for serious citizens. Bring them home. Now let's be clear. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=435.32s)]
*  Untrained protection is no protection at all. The Jewish community needs defenders, not just gun [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=440.52s)]
*  owners. I mean, this was, yeah, this is the famous case that I'm talking about. Ironically [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=444.04s)]
*  IDF reserve is charged with manslaughter after civilian who stopped terror attack. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=450.12s)]
*  Aviad Frisia is charged with manslaughter for Yuval Kestelman, a civilian who stopped the terror [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=454.44s)]
*  attack in Jerusalem. Frisia mistook Kestelman for an attacker firing despite clear signs. He [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=459.88s)]
*  posed no threat by the way, they released them initially. And then people were like, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=464.52000000000004s)]
*  what the are you doing? Oh, there's a ton of JDL fanboys in South Florida area. This isn't surprising. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=469.96s)]
*  Yeah. The dude he shot was on his knees, hands up in the air. I think it was a, a former policeman [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  or was literally a, I think currently a cop or he was just like an off duty cop or something. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=484.28s)]
*  Okay. And this dude went up and shot and killed him with his, when he was on his knees with his [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=491.32s)]
*  hands in the air, speaking in Hebrew, saying he's Jewish. How can a guy who was literally [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=498.28s)]
*  shopper looking to Arab immediately go on the line and write to Arabs? No, that's how it happens. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=502.44s)]
*  Anti-Semitic incident in Miami. They literally write who the shooter is, but they still call [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  it anti-Semitic on Hebrew news.com anti-Semitic incident in Miami. He shot Palestinians and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=513.0799999999999s)]
*  revealed that he had hit Jews with a Kipa. Check this one out. Mordechai Brafman, a frequent [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=518.1999999999999s)]
*  customer of bagel time cafe said his heart breaks for his community. It's absolutely abhorrent to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=523.24s)]
*  see this kind of vandalism for not only showing private Israel, but private the United States said [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=527.64s)]
*  Brafman. Brafman said there are months that he eats breakfast and lunch at the restaurant every [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=531.16s)]
*  day and cannot believe what people are capable of to see this level of fragmentation is, is very, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=535.24s)]
*  very unfortunate at Brafman. When he found out that the cafe he frequents, the Miami beach bagel [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=541.08s)]
*  shop faced a third act of hatred. The act of hatred was a man tearing down and stealing the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=546.28s)]
*  American flag. It's anti-Semitic. The mistake Jews for Arabs. Don't you understand? Oh true. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=553.4s)]
*  That's what they meant. Except they were Arab. They're just Jewish Arabs. They're Arab Jews. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=558.12s)]
*  They were there Mizrahi. Anyway, however bad you thought the daily telegraph anti-Semitic stunt was [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  is probably way worse. And here's proof. See for yourself why this needs to be reported. Oh, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=571.16s)]
*  this is the Australian story that I wanted to talk about. What it wasn't this like the, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=575.16s)]
*  wasn't this the, what do you call it? There are claims tonight of a media stunt intended [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=580.76s)]
*  to catch out a Palestine supporting Sydney restaurant. The owner of Cairo takeaway in [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=586.36s)]
*  the inner west says his staff were targeted by a hidden camera setup in a bid to get them saying [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=591.8s)]
*  something inflammatory relating to the conflict in Gaza. What began as a simple takeaway order, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=598.52s)]
*  a cup of hibiscus tea for the man in the white shirt and hat ended in confrontation. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=605.96s)]
*  Is there any evidence the parties involved are Zionist? Does evidence not point to the man who [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=611.96s)]
*  was manning the gun that fired passive voice intended by the way, isn't as mon is what I [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=615.4000000000001s)]
*  can't understand what kind of joke you're trying to make there. Yes. The, the American Jewish guy [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=621.24s)]
*  that thought that he saw Palestinians and thought that he killed them was pro-Israel. Yes. It's not [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=628.68s)]
*  simply because he's Jewish that I'm making this assertion. I'm making this assertion because he [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=637.8s)]
*  shot two Arab looking people thinking that they were Palestinians. And he also shot them and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=643.4s)]
*  thought that he killed them outside. And I'll do exactly what you did to me filming. Danielle [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=650.1999999999999s)]
*  Gusmorelli is a reporter from the daily telegraph with her is a camera crew and a Jewish man who [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=655.64s)]
*  ordered the tea. Workers at Cairo takeaway in Newtown say a staff member served him just like [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=662.36s)]
*  they would any other customer, but he tried to provoke them. Employees were too afraid to speak [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=668.12s)]
*  on camera, but told 10 news first, the customer said, am I upsetting you being here? And she said, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=673.8s)]
*  I'm just asking you what you, he says, because I'm Jewish. Staff claim when the waitress walked [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=679.88s)]
*  away outside, she became aware the customer was with a camera crew and she began filming. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=686.2s)]
*  What's alleged to be an organised stunt that didn't go to plan. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=699.88s)]
*  We are a small corner restaurant in Newtown that is proud to stand in solidarity with this community, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=704.36s)]

*  literally nothing in the media at the same time. Well-known Lebanese artists meant to represent [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=956.44s)]
*  Australia. Venice Bayan now was dropped breaking all normal processes is so strange, dude. It's [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=960.6s)]

*  I guess it's like very similar to the way that conservatives operated for years [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=995.08s)]
*  to create perceived victimhood. This is all this is. People who are pro Israel are just fucking [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=1000.12s)]
*  conservative. That's it. And they cry, bully in the same exact fucking way. It's the same shit. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=1008.6s)]

*  on the other hand is that when white conservative men do this, everybody goes, okay, dude, shut the [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=1026.2s)]
*  fuck up. Like stop crying. Okay. The fuck are you talking about? But because antisemitism is a real [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=1032.04s)]
*  issue. Okay. And Jewish people are still in the Western world, a marginalized identity. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=1040.28s)]
*  There was a lot more motion in progressive circles that, uh, towards this sort of thing. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=1046.52s)]
*  And people actually do treat it seriously and not regarded in the same fucking way that they would [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=1052.52s)]
*  if it was like a white Christian guy being like Christianity is under attack. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=1058.8400000000001s)]

*  Jewish Zionists do not fucking recognize is that you're just undermining a very real problem with [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=1077.56s)]
*  antisemitism by diluting the pool with ridiculous bullshit like this. And I don't know why ultra [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ymzIwA6wA&t=1084.84s)]
