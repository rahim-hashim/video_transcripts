**HasanAbi:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g)
*  Oh my God, dude had 150 pipe bombs in his house. I don't care about his political affiliations in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=0.0s)]
*  this situation. Are you serious? Like this is the one thing that the FBI is supposed to do [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=8.88s)]
*  is just like apprehend guys like this. So they don't turn around and say, Oh, we had him on our [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  radar. All right. There's one more story that I want to cover that I think is not getting a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=21.6s)]
*  lot of attention in the sea of all of these, like in the sea of all these other stories about, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=31.44s)]
*  you know, exploding Teslas and the NOLA attack. The FBI found 150 homemade bombs at Virginia [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  home during search in December. Prosecutors say in Norfolk, Virginia, federal agents found one of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=42.88s)]
*  the largest stockpiles of homemade explosives they've ever seized when they arrested a Virginia [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=49.04s)]
*  man on a f***ing arms charge last month, according to a court filing by federal prosecutors. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=53.68s)]
*  Investigators seized more than 150 pipe bombs and other homemade devices. When they searched the home [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=58.4s)]
*  of Brad Spafford, Northwest of Norfolk in December, the prosecutor said in a motion filed Monday, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=63.84s)]
*  prosecutors wrote that this is believed to be the largest seizure by number of finished explosive [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=71.52s)]
*  devices in FBI history. Most of the bombs were found at the detached garage at the home of the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=76.56s)]
*  Isle of Wight County, along with tools and bomb making materials, including fuses and pieces of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=83.52s)]
*  plastic pipe. According to court documents, the prosecutor also wrote several additional apparent [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=89.68s)]
*  pipe bombs were found in a backpack in the home's bedroom, completely unsecured in the home. He [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=93.76s)]
*  shares with his wife and two young children. Spafford 36 was charged with possession of a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=98.16s)]
*  firearm in violation of the national f***ing arms act. Law enforcement officers alleged he owned [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=104.64s)]
*  unregistered short, an unregistered short bearer rifle. Prosecutors have said he faces numerous [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=109.44s)]
*  additional potential charges related to the explosives. Defense attorneys argued in a motion [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=114.24s)]
*  Tuesday that authorities haven't produced evidence that he was planning violence. Also noting that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=120.48s)]
*  he has no criminal record. Further, they questioned whether the explosive devices were usable because [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=124.72s)]
*  professionally trained explosive technicians had to rig the devices to explode them. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=129.68s)]
*  There's not a shred of evidence on the record that Mr. Spafford ever threatened anyone [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=134.96s)]
*  and the contention that someone might be in danger because of their political views and comments is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=139.36s)]
*  nonsensical. The defense lawyers wrote messages were left Wednesday, seeking further comment from [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=144.08s)]
*  the defense lawyers who signed the motion. The investigation began in 2023 when an informant told [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  authorities that Spafford was stockpiling weapons and ammunition according to court documents. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=154.08s)]
*  The informant, a friend, told authorities Spafford had disfigured his hand in 2021 while [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=158.16s)]
*  working on homemade explosives. The informant, a friend, probably a federal agent, prosecutor said [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=162.72s)]
*  he was he has only two fingers on his right hand. The informant told authorities that Spafford was [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=168.4s)]
*  using pictures of the president and apparent reference to President Joe Biden for target [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=173.04s)]
*  practice and that he believed political assassination should be brought back. Numerous law [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=178.16s)]
*  enforcement officers and bomb technicians searched the property on December 17th. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=183.6s)]
*  The agents located so here say guys, it's illegal to have 150 finished pipe bombs in your house. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=188.4s)]
*  Like what do you mean? Like what do you mean? So here's it doesn't matter if he was going to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=196.16s)]

*  pot bombs in the privacy of my own home, I should be able to do so. What the hell's going on? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=207.28s)]
*  Sick of the goddang nanny state. God forbid men have hobbies. The informant told authorities [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=214.8s)]
*  is here say I know his intent to kill the president while alleged play no role in the fact [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=220.56s)]
*  that he had 150 finished pipe bombs chatter. That's my point. Like that is already illegal on its own [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  chatter. Not whether or not he wanted to kill the president or not. Bro was out there crafting like [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=238.96s)]
*  he wanted to make sure he could hit the higher point in his skill tree. Yeah. He wanted to he [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=246.72s)]
*  wanted to develop explosive ordinance expertise. He's like, I'm sorry, I got this rough style [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=251.28s)]
*  craft bench and honestly, I wanted to get to get to the third tech tree, you know, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=258.16s)]
*  once I started making it, I couldn't stop. You know, there's a glitch right now on the server [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=264.32000000000005s)]
*  where for for every 50 pot bombs, you get extra credit. You are defending the FBI right now. Oh, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dude had 150 pipe bombs in his house. I don't care about his [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  political affiliations in this situation. Are you serious? Like this is the one thing that the FBI [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=284.56s)]
*  is supposed to do is just like apprehend guys like this. So they don't turn around and say, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=291.12s)]
*  oh, we had him on our radar. Like, usually, they turn around with guys like this and say, oh, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=297.6s)]
*  he was on our radar. We didn't realize he was going to use 150 pipe bombs. It's like the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=306.08s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security. Okay. Is an institution. It's relatively new and it shouldn't [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=312.16s)]
*  exist. But before the Department of Homeland Security, you had INS. Also, I have, you know, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=318.72s)]
*  issues with that as well. But before the Department of Homeland Security, sex tracking still happened. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=324.88000000000005s)]
*  Okay. And the FBI was in charge of it. Now the Department of Homeland Security under [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  ICE takes care of sex tracking incidents. Okay. It investigates and prosecutes sex traffickers. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  Do you think that I'm against that function of the federal government? No, I am not. Just because I [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  am against ICE on principle does not mean that I don't think that there needs to be a federal [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  government agency that is in charge of investigating and prosecuting and putting behind bars people who [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  engage in sex trafficking, for example, or in this case, if someone is building 150 pipe bombs [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=366.4s)]
*  in their home, it's good that the federal government goes, Hey, that's illegal. We're [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=373.28s)]
*  arresting you. Wow. Controversial opinion. I know I had to take the glasses off for this one because [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  I could, I didn't want to read chat any longer. You know what I mean? I was just, this one cooked [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=385.2s)]
*  me a little bit. I'm not going to lie. This one, this one took a lot out of me. I must, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=390.64s)]
*  I must be just like jank going right wing on my right wing arc. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=395.76s)]
*  Okay. Anyway, numerous law enforcement officers and bomb technicians searched the property on [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=406.96s)]
*  December 17th illegally in direct violation of his fourth amendment and second amendment rights. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=417.12s)]
*  By the way, I call that unlawful search and seizure brother in direct violation of the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=423.76s)]
*  first amendment, second amendment rights. My second amendment is there to protect the first. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=429.68s)]
*  That's why I need the got dang pop bombs. Anyway, agents located the rifle and explosive devices, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=434.16s)]
*  some of which had been hand labeled as lethal and some of which were loaded into a variable [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=439.2s)]
*  wearable vest. I wonder what he was going to do with the 150 pipe bombs, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=445.2s)]
*  some of which were loaded onto a wearable [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=451.52s)]
*  technicians detonated most of the devices on site because they were deemed unsafe to transport, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=458.32s)]
*  though several were kept for analysis at a hearing Tuesday, federal magistrate judge [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=462.4s)]
*  Lawrence Leonard determined that Spafford could be released into house arrest at his mother's home. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  But agree to keep him detained while government files further arguments. I'm sorry. What? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=476.15999999999997s)]

*  What? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=497.62s)]
*  In response, prosecutors reiterated why they believe Spafford is dangerous, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=504.42s)]
*  writing that while he is not known to have engaged in [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=507.94s)]
*  any apparent violence, he has certainly expressed interest in the same. Through his manufacture of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=518.1s)]
*  pipe bombs, Mark lethal, his possession of riot gear and a vest loaded with pipe bombs, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=524.18s)]
*  his support for political assassinations and his use of the pictures of the president for target [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=530.18s)]
*  practice. Dude, there are certain first time offenses that you are, you know, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=534.9s)]
*  allegedly engaging in that require you to not be able to go out in public. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  Okay. This, I believe fits that bill. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=554.9s)]
*  As opposed to not that far away in Florida, a judge [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=564.66s)]
*  refute a judge put a hundred thousand dollar bail on a woman having a phone call. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=572.0999999999999s)]
*  A claim denials phone call. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=580.8199999999999s)]
*  Like, you could let Luigi out right now. Tomorrow. I wouldn't feel unsafe. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=584.66s)]
*  This guy roaming the streets. Everybody should feel unsafe. What the hell? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=612.1800000000001s)]
*  You are to the right of the FBI on this issue. Yeah, I am [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=622.74s)]
*  because I secretly think the FBI is like, no, no, no, that that's our guy, dude. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=629.22s)]
*  Dude, you're letting him out. I mean, you're not letting him out. Dude, come on. Come on, judge. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=634.82s)]
*  That's our best. That's the next guy. That's the next job bar right there. What are you doing? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=647.38s)]
*  We haven't even activated him yet. He was a Republican, so he should be able to go home. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=656.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Excuse me. He has a wife and children. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=662.1s)]
*  There's a lot of dangerous bomb making materials in his. There's a lot of dangerous bomb making [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=672.1800000000001s)]

*  Oh my God, he's out. He's out on bond in our own backyard. We're hearing new details on an FBI raid [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=691.7800000000001s)]

*  even met him. They told me he and his family moved to this house behind me just a few months ago. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=749.38s)]
*  Those who spoke with me did not want to appear on camera. They tell me Spafford and his family [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=754.5s)]
*  kept to themselves after moving to the 20 acre farm last fall. A friend of the suspect acted [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=759.3000000000001s)]
*  as an informant for the FBI for more than a year. They told agents Spafford was stockpiling weapons [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=764.34s)]
*  at one point, blowing three fingers off his hand while making homemade explosives. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=770.1s)]
*  The informant said Spafford used pictures of president Biden for target practice, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=774.9s)]
*  alleging he hoped a shooter doesn't miss Kamala. They also told the FBI that Spafford and his [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=779.22s)]
*  friends are preparing to do something Spafford cannot do alone. In mid December, the FBI swarmed [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=785.0600000000001s)]
*  in with the helicopter. I mean, don't investigate the friends either. I think I wouldn't. I think [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=790.9s)]
*  they're all fine. They're just good old boys, you know, hanging out, having fun. What's wrong with [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=797.62s)]
*  you? You're weird for thinking it. Yeah. You should wait until they actually do something [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=803.3s)]
*  and then you can have an incredibly violent siege campaign on whatever compound that they live in [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=815.78s)]
*  with their families and then gas the entire family and kill all the children and the dogs [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=823.3s)]
*  alongside the people in a shootout. And then you can pat yourself on the back. Like, yeah, we did [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=829.9399999999999s)]
*  it only after the bombs have exploded, of course. And you can tell the media, Hey, he was on our [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=836.02s)]
*  radar by the way, but we let him go. After parked in the field across the road and several agents [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=842.5s)]
*  wrote, I know FBI informants are sus. I know they are notoriously corrupt. I know [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=852.98s)]
*  the dude still had 150 pipe bombs in his house. Hello. Like I don't care about the, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=859.62s)]
*  he wanted to kill Biden stuff. Okay. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=870.98s)]
*  That's it for me. Listen, I have, I have a, a fairly high bar to clear [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=883.38s)]
*  in terms of what I think constitutes a grave threat to the public. Okay. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=894.5s)]
*  And for me, what I personally believe constant grave threat to the public is when you [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=907.6999999999999s)]
*  make your 149th pipe bomb and you go, gotta get one more just to round it out. Okay. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=912.98s)]
*  That's it. You do that. And I'm like, maybe you should be in jail. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=930.6600000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. If the dude was even one shade browner than he is, he would currently be shipped off to [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=936.26s)]
*  the Colorado ADX Florence facility. Okay. The sit in the isolated cell, never to see daylight ever [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=945.9399999999999s)]
*  again for the rest of his life. But when you're a white guy and a Trump supporter, they just let you [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=955.54s)]
*  walk after the bomb. Okay. So I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=959.14s)]
*  After making 150 pipe bombs, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=965.86s)]
*  that is crazy. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=977.06s)]
*  Maybe I just like collecting pipe bombs. Have you thought about that? Maybe have a bad go [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=984.9s)]
*  for problem on my golf course that I'm the groundskeeper of. I know you said this jokingly, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=998.0s)]
*  but there's a real possibility that this makes his way up to the SCOTUS. No, this is one [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=1005.3s)]
*  of those things where they will let it go. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=1008.98s)]
*  I don't think they're going to use, I mean, they can try and defend it, but I don't think [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=1012.46s)]
*  a lower court will take it up. Like it is not going to, they're not winning the appeals [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=1016.74s)]
*  on this. That's crazy. Like there's a couple of things that the Fed or even the federal [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=1021.98s)]
*  government doesn't mess with. And that's, I think pipe bombs is one of them. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=1034.1000000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kja58pDk29g&t=1037.54s)]
