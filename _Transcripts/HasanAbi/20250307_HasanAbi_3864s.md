# Trump Threatens Hamas And All Of Gaza | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o)
*  So, all right, I'll read it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=0.0s)]
*  When Trump aid sounded out Israeli officials in early February about the possibility of [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1.84s)]
*  engaging directly with Hamas, the Israelis advised them not to do it, particularly not [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=5.72s)]
*  without preconditions. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=9.96s)]
*  Israel found out through other channels that the US was moving ahead anyway. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=11.4s)]
*  Netanyahu has avoided publicly criticizing Trump since Axios revealed the unprecedented [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=14.48s)]
*  And this morning, a top Hamas official spoke to see, all right, we're going to, we're going [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=19.84s)]
*  to talk about, dude, that's crazy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=28.6s)]
*  That's a crazy thing that I never thought I would ever hear a top Hamas official talk [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=30.4s)]
*  to CBS. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=33.92s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=34.92s)]
*  That there's a crazy thing to hear, man. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=35.92s)]
*  Wild. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=39.64s)]
*  Another, another sign of the changing times community gift to subs implies the existence [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=40.64s)]
*  of streamer gifted subs. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=47.2s)]
*  Will you be gifting subs too soon? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=48.36s)]
*  No, I welcome the oilers gifting the subs. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=50.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=54.96s)]
*  CBS are all terrorists and bathizers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=55.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure they'll, they'll come after CBS sometime soon. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  They'll be like, wow. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=60.36s)]
*  CBS is Hamas. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=61.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=62.36s)]
*  CBS is also, yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=63.36s)]
*  CBS is Hamas is true. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=64.36s)]
*  It's correct. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=65.36s)]
*  Cancel CBS, CBS news about talks to extend the ceasefire in Gaza after president Trump's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=66.36s)]
*  chief envoy, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=72.84s)]
*  Thank you for the tank of the subs hype train level three, baby. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=74.08s)]
*  Explain what the president meant by his so-called last warning to Hamas. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=78.36s)]
*  Deborah Pata has more on Steve Witkop's comments to reporters at the White House. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=82.72s)]
*  I think there's going to be some action with a hundred big ones. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  It could be jointly with the Israelis. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  It's out of fear right now, but I think Hamas has an opportunity to act reasonably, to do [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  what's right and then to walk out. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=98.84s)]
*  But senior Hamas official, Moshe al-Masri says they have no intention of leaving. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=101.36s)]
*  Well, they don't want to rule Gaza after the war. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=106.12s)]
*  They will not disarm. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=110.0s)]
*  He said until there is a Palestinian state. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=111.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's insanely valid. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=114.88s)]
*  The most valid statement of all time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=117.3s)]
*  Like what, what are we doing here? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=120.24s)]
*  What kind of, I mean, it's, it's valid for Ukraine to have a similar, it's valid for [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine to say the same exact thing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=127.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=130.0s)]
*  Just as, just as it is valid for Palestinians to say the same exact thing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=131.0s)]
*  Hamas is a legitimate resistance movement, he said, and we won't abandon our weapons. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=138.04s)]
*  The U.S. has designated Hamas a t***ed organization. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=146.28s)]
*  Al-Masri says the only way to free the remaining hostages is through negotiations to end the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=150.56s)]
*  war. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=157.12s)]
*  The uncertainty has left many hostage families raging against their prime minister, Benjamin [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=159.12s)]
*  Netanyahu, whom they blame for failed peace talks. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=165.0s)]
*  Nama Weinberg, whose cousin was f***ed in captivity, had this message for president [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=169.24s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  Don't cooperate with Netanyahu. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  Don't be the one that would be responsible for the death. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  That's crazy that they're showing this on American news. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  This is like, for the past 16 months, if I were to ever bring this up, it had to be [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=187.76s)]
*  from like, Haaretz. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it is, I mean, a huge chunk of it now just seems that it's like Hamas is talking [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  to them, we're allowed to take seriously the idea that there's like pressures on this conflict [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=200.48s)]
*  that exist outside of like, whatever f***ing like Netanyahu and the White House agreed, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=204.98s)]
*  agree is allowed to be discussed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=210.12s)]
*  And like, by the way, it's not because like, again, like Trump and Netanyahu have suddenly [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=211.6s)]
*  created this space on their own initiative for like this sort of thing to exist. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  It's like the combination of, I mean, the fact that like, I mean, just how events have [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=219.56s)]
*  played out, like where they're at at the state of the conflict, where they're at with like [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  the state of the conflict in Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=228.64s)]
*  They're also talking about how Israel is f***ing up the bag a little bit. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  So that's like, there's also that too. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=234.28s)]
*  There's like a nature. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  There's, I'm not waiting for the New York Times to write that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  Once the New York Times starts writing about it like that, though, it's over. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=245.12s)]
*  Israel is done. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=246.12s)]
*  They might as well, they might as well shutter the operation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=247.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=249.12s)]
*  Like this is the last bastion of, of, of unfettered unrestricted Hasbro. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=250.12s)]
*  So we'll see RIP ad block. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=257.84s)]
*  I know, dude, look at Bob's furniture. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=259.68s)]

*  Yeah, I mean, actually, who the fuck did you say that about anybody? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=408.52s)]
*  Also, Trump is Trump is never really liked Benjamin and Yahoo anyway. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=413.36s)]
*  It's not like I don't think that there is any I don't think that they have any love [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=417.72s)]
*  between them money that he gets from Miriam Adelson. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  He doesn't give a shit. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=426.36s)]
*  And also, like I mentioned, Yahoo is there's a really good documentary that I watched. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=427.24s)]
*  I think it's called a King Beebe or something. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  It was it's an Israeli documentary, but it's just like it really like it tells the story [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=436.16s)]
*  of Beebe, like, you know, his own background, whatever. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=440.08s)]
*  But it ends. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=442.88s)]
*  Nobody likes this piece of shit. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=443.76s)]
*  Nobody ends with Trump and Melania coming to Beebe's house for dinner. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=445.4s)]
*  And like, and they're all like, and it is such a one way like glazing. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=451.52s)]
*  Yeah, it is like a crispy cream factory in there. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=458.88s)]
*  And the impression that you get of it is that like they're both men who, like on the whole, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=460.12s)]
*  are extremely conscious of like who wears the pants in the relationship. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  The problem, though, is that like eventually, as is evidently now happening, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  that like Trump was going to run into eventually wanting to do something for himself [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=473.44s)]
*  and for his administration that would conflict with Netanyahu. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  And whereas Biden was like, oh, you know, we'll give you anything. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=480.24s)]
*  We'll roll over. Like, you know, like whatever. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=484.92s)]
*  Like, that's just not Trump's approach, like setting, you know, like it's I mean, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=487.08000000000004s)]
*  it's a crazy world we live in, but it's the truth. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=491.04s)]
*  It's undeniable. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=493.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=495.12s)]
*  like maybe Trump's pettiness might work in the in favor of Palestinians, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=497.44s)]
*  but it doesn't seem to be the case because every time Benjamin [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=502.84s)]
*  anyhow undermines Donald Trump, he just throws a flashbang [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=505.76s)]
*  in the middle of the conversation by being like, I'm going to kill all the Palestinians [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=510.64s)]
*  that I'm going to kill super hard, harder than anyone's ever killed them before. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=513.96s)]
*  Like every time Benjamin and you over [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=518.0s)]
*  instead of doing the Biden thing, which is to be like, oh, I'm going to give him a stern [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=520.56s)]
*  talk and do he just does the reverse Brandon, I guess, which is I'm [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=525.2s)]
*  I'm going to be more brutal than anyone's ever, ever seen before. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=530.5200000000001s)]
*  That's what he did. That's what he did when this initially leaked. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=535.4000000000001s)]
*  That's when Donald Trump came out with that truth social post where he was like, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to pummel Gaza into the ground type shit. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  Like every time, every time [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=545.88s)]
*  there's any information that like undermines Trump, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=548.88s)]
*  he goes he goes in the opposite direction. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=553.6s)]
*  So I'll read it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=556.36s)]
*  When Trump aid sounded out Israeli officials in early February [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=558.0400000000001s)]
*  about the possibility of engaging directly with Hamas, the Israelis advised them not to do it, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=560.9200000000001s)]
*  particularly not without preconditions. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=565.4s)]
*  Israel found out through other channels that the US was moving ahead anyway. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=567.24s)]
*  Netanyahu was avoided publicly criticizing Trump since Axios [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=570.84s)]
*  revealed the unprecedented US Hamas talks on Wednesday, saying only that Israel [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=574.52s)]
*  had made its opinion clear to the US. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=579.4s)]
*  But Netanyahu's closest confidant, Ron Dermer, who began his career [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  as a Republican political operative, he's been the Israeli ambassador to the US. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=584.9599999999999s)]
*  He's like the go between essentially for the US and Netanyahu. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=588.24s)]
*  Dermer was much less restrained a day earlier in a call with US hostage envoy [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=593.0s)]
*  Adam Bowler, the sources said the call happened several hours [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=597.24s)]
*  after Bowler met in Doha with Khalil Alhaya, one of Hamas's most senior [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=601.4s)]
*  political officials and the head of its negotiating team. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's it is Bowler's negotiations in Qatari capital began the week prior [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=608.52s)]
*  with a meeting with lower level Hamas officials talks for Senate on bringing home [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=611.92s)]
*  American hostage, Adon Alexander, 21, and the bodies of this is also like part of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  what's got to be grinding his gears is that like Trump is actually doing something [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=618.68s)]
*  to bring up. It's like that is that could create a I mean, it's you know, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=622.4799999999999s)]
*  I don't know how much Netanyahu is really scared about. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=626.52s)]
*  And I like I truly don't know. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=629.0s)]
*  Like if I and I don't mean like I don't know what the people around him's [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=630.52s)]
*  like biggest fears are domestically, like what they feel like. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=634.4399999999999s)]
*  Could threaten their power. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=637.56s)]
*  But it would strike me that like the American president outflanking you on [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=638.88s)]
*  bringing the Israelis home does seem like something that could have political [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=642.1199999999999s)]
*  consequences in the right context. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  The US measures of Hamas was releasing the US hostage would go a long way with Trump, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  who would then press for a broader deal that could involve a long term, true safe [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=652.2399999999999s)]
*  passage out of Gaza for Hamas leaders, the release of all remaining hostages [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=655.2399999999999s)]
*  in the end of the war. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=658.1199999999999s)]
*  This part is really funny to me because that right there is again [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=659.2399999999999s)]
*  like Western thinking where they still have not learned the lessons at all, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=665.8s)]
*  where they're like, no, no, no, these guys want to escape. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  They want to they want to really they have like telling a palestinian. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=672.4399999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, you know, Sinwar was a was a look at him. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=676.7199999999999s)]
*  He's such a schmuck for getting like caught. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Or or when they when they were lying over and over again about like [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=681.56s)]
*  Yahuasin war being like he's probably in Doha by now or he's he's on the escape [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=685.76s)]
*  through the tunnel there. He's having like he's sipping caperini is like the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  one thing that Palestinians won't do is fucking leave. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=694.88s)]
*  OK, it's it's that's the thing that they just cannot comprehend. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=700.4s)]
*  It's so like I get why an Israeli person like an Israeli politician would think [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=704.84s)]
*  that I get why an American politician would think that because they're like, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=710.96s)]
*  why the fuck would I get into trouble? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=713.84s)]
*  Why would I put myself in the line of fire? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=715.4s)]
*  These guys don't want to leave. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=718.32s)]
*  OK, that's why Yahuasin died fighting rather than [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=720.4s)]
*  chained to multiple hostages as the Israeli media previously had claimed. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=725.12s)]
*  As though this is as though Israel as though Israel shows restraint [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=730.76s)]
*  in terms of killing their own hostage. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=734.92s)]
*  I got to say, though, like it is again, like not to just constantly like [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=736.72s)]
*  seem like I'm praising Trump and relative to Biden on this stuff. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=741.0s)]
*  But it is just crazy how the eye of the Trump administration is like [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=743.76s)]
*  we need to bottle this shit back up. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=747.88s)]
*  And, you know, even though we love Israel and we love, you know, what, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=749.84s)]
*  you know, we love Zionism, we love the Settler Project or whatever. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=753.92s)]
*  But the idea of like this war is a thing that like they've got to, you know, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=756.5999999999999s)]
*  put, you know, put the cork on is like such a different approach [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=759.88s)]
*  to how like the first year of plus of this conflict was was being managed [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=764.56s)]
*  from the US and that's because that's how it was happening. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=770.16s)]
*  They were managing it. They weren't even there was not even I mean, it's it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  It feels so psycho just how many arguments we had with people over, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=775.8s)]
*  you know, the extent to which like, oh, can Biden really apply pressure or whatever? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=780.84s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, I mean, take a look at what God damn Donald Trump is doing. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=784.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=788.92s)]
*  I it's I do think I do think that Trump's petty [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=790.4s)]
*  narcissistic nature might actually cause a little bit of a dent [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=795.6s)]
*  in the seemingly impossible to shake allegiance that we have to Israel, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=800.72s)]
*  like because it's previous reports have shown that Trump is not exactly super [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=806.3599999999999s)]
*  fond of Netanyahu. There was a point where when Netanyahu, I think, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=812.0799999999999s)]
*  celebrated the Biden victory that he like even called him a fucking asshole or [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=814.5999999999999s)]
*  something. So. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=818.52s)]
*  You know that, but this is where it's like that and like his his interest in like [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=820.7199999999999s)]
*  gaining momentum domestically by being like, see, I I I brought out an American [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=824.92s)]
*  captive like I'm doing, I'm the peacemaker. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=831.1999999999999s)]
*  And also, I think it's from the perspective of just like when you when you [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=834.04s)]
*  don't have an outcome of like we need to give Palestinians freedom, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=837.12s)]
*  which is not fucking Donald Trump's perspective. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=840.72s)]
*  But the idea is like instead, what are the deliverables here? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=842.88s)]
*  What are the things that I can actually get out of this? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=847.0s)]
*  What can I demonstrate as like a political victory on the broad category of [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=849.8s)]
*  Israel-Palestine shit, you know, that both sides, Republican and Democrat, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=855.32s)]
*  would prospectively like, you know? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=860.52s)]
*  And to me, that's that's more or less what the guy I mean, that seems at least on [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=862.12s)]
*  this specific narrow part of it, because obviously it doesn't seem like Trump is [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=866.52s)]
*  doing anything to restrain Israel when it comes to the Syria shit. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=869.88s)]

*  restrained. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=876.16s)]

*  from GOP rivals. There's that moment, too, where Trump at a rally said Netanyahu [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  let us down just before the US killed top Iranian general, like this was before [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=913.84s)]

*  And that problem wouldn't be around. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1298.8000000000002s)]
*  We'll rise. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1300.72s)]
*  So then they would say they hate Nazis. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1301.8000000000002s)]
*  And then the mother would disappear. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1303.92s)]
*  So I don't get, you know, it is true. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1307.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, like it's not. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1310.72s)]
*  I've said this story before, so you'll forgive me. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1312.28s)]
*  My parents, as you know, they passed to the Nazi Holocaust. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1316.44s)]
*  OK. And then the rest of it is his own, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1319.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, his parents is like opinion about the German people as a whole. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1322.32s)]
*  I mean, I'll give I'll give like a personal example. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1327.08s)]
*  Like the first time I went to the West Bank, it was I remember [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1329.44s)]
*  having somebody was like translating and [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1333.92s)]
*  and then, you know, somebody like a like somebody was translating. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1337.88s)]
*  And you can still tell that it was like [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1342.6000000000001s)]
*  like like the shorthand of like talking or referring to Israelis as Jews and so on. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1346.3200000000002s)]
*  It was it like it was uncomfortable to me. Yeah. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1351.0800000000002s)]
*  But then, you know, I had like it was the first time I'd considered like [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1353.68s)]
*  because I, you know, that had never been something I'd directly confront, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1357.76s)]
*  like, you know, experienced before, like it even found in media, frankly. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1360.2800000000002s)]
*  Like it really was like the first time that like a like it just I had [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1363.48s)]
*  been struck with it and I had to sort of think about it. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1367.5600000000002s)]
*  They're like, well, you know, like what are the I mean, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1369.96s)]
*  this has been expressed in many ways by people more eloquent than myself. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1373.2800000000002s)]
*  But like in what like in what world has this person encountered you [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1376.8400000000001s)]
*  in a different context and like, can I really, you know, to, you know, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1379.8400000000001s)]
*  Norm said it well, like, can I really get hot under the collar about this? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1384.1200000000001s)]
*  Like if I'm here in part because of like what people who wear the, you know, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1387.6000000000001s)]
*  operating under the aegis of that flag or are saying or doing like it is [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1391.8000000000002s)]
*  there is, yeah, the greatest, the greatest example of this is if you are a Jewish [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1397.2s)]
*  person living in France and someone draws a star of David outside of your house, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1402.0s)]
*  that is an entirely different context that is very clearly [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1406.88s)]
*  and deliberately signaling that an anti-Semitic act [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1411.44s)]
*  is most likely going to occur, right? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1414.88s)]
*  That in and of itself could even be interpreted as anti-Semitic, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1418.3600000000001s)]
*  understandably, whereas when [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1421.0s)]
*  when Jewish settlers in the West Bank spray paint the star of David [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1424.4s)]
*  outside of the house of a Palestinian villager, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1428.6000000000001s)]
*  that means that they are going to go there and they're going to blow up [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1432.6000000000001s)]
*  the fucking house with makeshift Molotov cocktails. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1435.8400000000001s)]
*  Or it's a sign like in Gaza, what you see now is like, you know, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1439.04s)]
*  I saw a photo of a before and after of a bookshop, the before lovely bookshop [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1441.88s)]
*  before the war, after the war, come back. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1445.68s)]
*  Everything's all fucked up, scattered all over the place. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1448.1200000000001s)]
*  There's an orange, you know, star of David spray painted onto it. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1450.2s)]
*  And it's like, I, you know, I think it's like it's I, I will say I can't. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1454.0s)]
*  Like, it's astonishing to me how not anti-Semitic Palestinians [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1461.2s)]
*  are as a people in general, in spite of everything, in spite of everything. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1465.28s)]
*  Exactly. In spite of everything. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1468.32s)]
*  Like, it's such a I in fact, like I am sort of constantly amazed at like the [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1469.92s)]
*  like the general amount of like nuance and appreciation for this. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1475.16s)]
*  That Palestinians have in spite of like the very active conflation [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1478.84s)]
*  that the Israeli government by its existence and actions, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1482.6s)]
*  you know, makes every second of their lives. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1485.9199999999998s)]
*  I do want to show you guys [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1488.0s)]
*  one thing that I think is very interesting as well, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1491.1999999999998s)]
*  because if you think that this like [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1495.12s)]
*  deflective conflation that the Israeli state uses to justify its cause [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1497.4799999999998s)]
*  is like purely defensive and and the consistent ways in which they [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1502.1999999999998s)]
*  claim that they're defending themselves and they have security concerns [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1508.32s)]
*  and anyone that actually has an issue with that is simply being, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1511.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, anti-Semitic or whatever. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1515.6399999999999s)]
*  There is there is a very similar example from Goebbels himself [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1518.28s)]
*  talking about how Germans have valid security concerns [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1523.2399999999998s)]
*  and that anyone that comes after the Nazi state for its actions [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1527.7199999999998s)]
*  are actually coming after. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1532.76s)]
*  Now, I want to I want to show that. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1534.9199999999998s)]
*  I think I remember this thing. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1536.84s)]
*  I think I can find it if you haven't. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1537.96s)]
*  Let me see. Yeah, I can't find it. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1539.32s)]
*  It was like it went viral recently. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1541.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1543.24s)]
*  It went viral on Twitter. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1545.24s)]
*  There's a near like more or less like this, this brief one. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1546.96s)]
*  Yeah, that that is the one yet. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1550.56s)]
*  National socialism today is Germany's guiding political idea and worldview. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1551.8400000000001s)]
*  The entire German nation affirms it to criticize national socialism today, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1557.4s)]
*  therefore means to criticize the entire German people. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1561.56s)]
*  This is. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1565.68s)]
*  Damn near verbatim, one to one identical to people saying [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1567.16s)]
*  all Jews are Zionists, if you're criticizing Zionism, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1572.24s)]
*  you're basically criticizing Judaism and criticizing all Jews. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1574.6399999999999s)]
*  And like also, it's not just like the ism of it, because like, like, like, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1579.12s)]
*  it's like Zionism as its practiced, which is that. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1583.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not you can't you can't do the concept of a Jewish of a homeland. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1586.68s)]
*  You can't do this. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1590.6399999999999s)]
*  You can't do this and assume that everyone around you is going to not [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1592.48s)]
*  see this as as a direct. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1597.68s)]
*  There is no separation. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1601.32s)]
*  I want a standard like this is a standard that applies everywhere. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1602.56s)]
*  This is like you see the same thing when like Azerbaijan [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1606.04s)]
*  like rolls into formerly Armenian Armenian territories [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1609.64s)]
*  and puts up their own cultural objects and displays them ostentatiously. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1612.6s)]
*  Like it's a it's a it's a thing that. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1615.96s)]
*  You're being quite Islamophobic for criticizing that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1619.28s)]
*  OK, Azerbaijan is a good you're being anti Turk. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1623.0s)]
*  I you're being Islamophobic. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1627.4s)]
*  I can hold space for that. Yeah. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1629.6s)]
*  Excuse me. I really messed up. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1631.6s)]
*  We can I think we can perhaps give it some space, but I I do. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1633.3600000000001s)]
*  I do think that there is like when it because when it does come down to it, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1637.84s)]
*  right, like it is about like the like there's just like a quality [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1641.4s)]
*  with this stuff where what they want, what people want in like [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1645.64s)]
*  the arguments about this is an exception. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1648.68s)]
*  They know what these images suggest. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1650.72s)]
*  They know the historical meaning of them, like the import that when you see [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1652.92s)]
*  this kind of shit, that it suggests like ethnic cleansing is going on. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1655.72s)]
*  Mass murder is going on. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1659.16s)]
*  But like, no, what they want is an exemption that is actually in this context. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1660.84s)]
*  Maybe it makes sense. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1666.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's more purchase and legs and like, which is the same defense [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1667.52s)]
*  who does anybody who does this shit, you just gets further, further, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1670.48s)]
*  further along than others are allowed to. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1674.28s)]
*  Israel has turned like thousands of years of Jewish history, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1676.2s)]
*  like and religious iconography into fucking different versions of the swastika. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1683.88s)]
*  And then they complain and say, how dare you? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1690.0s)]
*  Like, how dare you? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1693.76s)]
*  How dare you say these things? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1696.0s)]
*  How dare you get mad at us? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1697.8400000000001s)]
*  You must be anti-Semitic for behaving this way. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1699.44s)]
*  It's like, no, dude, they're anti you. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1702.44s)]
*  They're anti death and destruction. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1704.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1707.16s)]
*  And if you consistently present in the, if you consistently present your actions [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1708.76s)]
*  as though you are doing it for Judaism, if you falsely conflate Judaism with the [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1716.4s)]
*  violent aggressive actions of Israel, then yes, of course people are going to [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1720.8s)]
*  inevitably go, yeah, I guess this is, I mean, this is a shorthand. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1725.68s)]
*  I will say that like the biggest thing in this regard that like kind of like [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1728.76s)]
*  did damage that I still think about a lot and is the, like the women's lingerie [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1733.08s)]

*  Like, I feel like sometimes in order to understand where my interlocutors, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1821.52s)]
*  my naysayers, the people who smear me as anti-Semite are coming from, I have to [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1827.6799999999998s)]
*  like shut off my fucking brain to not recognize any of this shit. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1831.36s)]
*  You know, yeah, KSA is the biggest culprit of this, too, with stinky ass Wahhabism [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1835.72s)]
*  and the way that they make the way that they claim Houthis or Kufar. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1839.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're they just got all the smoke for the Shias. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1843.48s)]
*  Yes. I mean, this is like in America as a hand in that, though, Seymour [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1846.28s)]
*  Hirsch in like the 2000s, he wrote this awesome article for New Yorker. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1849.32s)]
*  I forget the headline. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1853.84s)]
*  I mean, the thesis of the article was that like you could look at America's [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1854.72s)]
*  policy in the Middle East and America's policy in the Muslim world. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1859.2s)]
*  And you could broadly say that America was trying to engineer a geopolitical [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1862.1200000000001s)]
*  realignment that favored Sunni Islamic countries over Shia Islamic countries. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1866.56s)]
*  And there is like, you know, it's obviously it's pretty it's a pretty simplified [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1871.6399999999999s)]
*  version of it. But when you use that kind of frame, what it does allow you to see [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1876.12s)]
*  is like, yeah, like the ways in which like American policy ends up encouraging [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1880.12s)]
*  these like really aggressively essentialist ideas of like Islam or Judaism [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1884.0s)]
*  and the people who practice them and like who they have to be to be treated as [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1888.76s)]
*  like authentic representations of it. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1892.72s)]
*  Yeah. Let me see where. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1894.6s)]

*  I'm just looking looking for the OG quote, like where the full on just type the quote in. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1899.04s)]
*  I am doing it in quotes. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1903.0s)]
*  This is not. Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1904.84s)]
*  This is Goebbels on the United States. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1906.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh, wow. That's a little on the nose. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1910.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Here. Look, here's Joseph. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1912.48s)]
*  Here's here is. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1914.84s)]
*  Joe, Joe, I want to I want to say this. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1917.76s)]
*  I want to say this for a science before we read. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1920.2s)]
*  We're reading this because we think it's bad. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1922.48s)]
*  I mean, we're not fans of Joseph Goebbels and we think it's bad. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1925.72s)]
*  Yeah, I can't hear. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1929.72s)]
*  The American press is the noble right to complain about Europe. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1933.1200000000001s)]
*  It makes vigorous use of this right, particularly when Germany is involved. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1935.28s)]
*  National Socialist Germany is a thorn in its eye. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1938.16s)]
*  The Third Reich has always been the target of its mockery. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1940.32s)]
*  Hate, hatred, lies and slanders is the 30th of January, 1933, especially from that part [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1942.28s)]
*  controlled by the Jews. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1946.44s)]
*  The American press takes particular pleasure in criticizing Germany on the grounds [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1948.28s)]
*  of humanitarianism, civilization, human rights and culture. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1951.44s)]
*  True. It is every right to do so. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1954.92s)]
*  Its humanity is shown in most vivid form by lynchings, which is, again, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1956.44s)]
*  also kind of funny because, you know, they obviously [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1961.4s)]
*  tracked closely Jim Crow and whatnot because they were like, this is awesome. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1965.72s)]
*  We should do that. Precisely. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1970.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's also like you can see, like, isn't it interesting how like the disingenuous [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1971.68s)]
*  argumentation is like the eternal like argument, like arguing style of right wingers [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1977.24s)]
*  of all time. Yeah. Meth head debate perverts, a consistent, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1982.24s)]
*  a consistent through line throughout history that I just fucking hate. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1985.88s)]
*  Its civilization is shown in economic and political scandals that stink to high heaven. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1990.1200000000001s)]
*  Its human rights are displayed by 11 or 12 million unemployed who apparently [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1993.76s)]
*  chose to be so. And its culture exists only because it's always barren from older [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=1997.16s)]
*  European nations such as the nation of whatever. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2000.96s)]
*  He's like dunking on America. And then he goes, oh, I'm going to go to the [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2003.24s)]
*  And then he goes, the American press replies to our complaints by saying that it has [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2006.24s)]
*  nothing against Germany, only against national socialism. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2011.3600000000001s)]
*  That is a poor excuse. National socialism is today. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2014.3200000000002s)]
*  A national socialism today is Germany's guiding political idea and worldview. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2017.7600000000002s)]
*  The entire German nation affirms it to criticize national socialism today, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2021.7600000000002s)]
*  therefore means to criticize the entire German people. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2025.68s)]
*  Well, but here the thing is, is that like within Israel, right? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2028.92s)]
*  Like Zionism is and as like a like it's a like a like like the German [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2032.2s)]
*  German phrase for it or like how like they conceive of stuff like this, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2037.28s)]
*  like a Statsreisen, like it's a it's a it's a logic, it's an ideology of the state. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2040.4s)]
*  They supported the indoor like it's it's a accepted [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2044.88s)]
*  like reasoned in society. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2049.52s)]
*  But it's like the that what that speaks to, right, is like part of the problem of [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2051.96s)]
*  Zionism in the first place, because it ends up like creating this essential category, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2056.28s)]
*  staking what was previously not like again, like like what was like a population [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2060.64s)]
*  spread across, you know, I mean, like dozens of countries throughout the world, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2065.16s)]
*  but now essentially like in the post Holocaust world has staked [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2068.48s)]
*  the like category of Jews to the activity of the state here. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2073.08s)]
*  So it's like essentially realizing like fully affirming that logic [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2077.52s)]
*  that girl was laying out there. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2081.56s)]
*  Evan, who is Jewish? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2083.16s)]
*  You are literally a Jew hitting Nazi. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2084.68s)]
*  The real analogy here is I don't hate the Jews. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2087.4s)]
*  I don't hate Jews. I hate people who support genocide, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2089.6s)]
*  which is the equivalent of saying I don't hate Muslims. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2091.52s)]
*  I hate people who support genocide. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2093.08s)]
*  Do you see how supporting genocide is independent of religion? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2094.68s)]
*  Yeah, this was the original post. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2097.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't hate the Jews. I hate Zionists is the equivalent of saying [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2098.92s)]
*  I don't hate Muslims. The vast majority. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2101.2s)]
*  I hate the vast majority of Muslims. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2102.7999999999997s)]
*  It is it is like it's it's a real issue that like like like Jewish liturgy, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2104.44s)]

*  And so in the hands of people who like aren't willing to appreciate that, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2115.8399999999997s)]

*  How are you any different than these fucking Nazis? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2188.2s)]
*  You know, how are you any different than these groipers? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2192.12s)]
*  Liberal groipers is real. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2194.44s)]
*  I think it's crazy. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2196.72s)]
*  The liberal groipers, something Felix must have invented. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2198.48s)]
*  Yeah, he did. He he cooked. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2202.0s)]
*  He does talk about the liberal groipers. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2204.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think that's still what he's like. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2206.92s)]
*  I mean, he's he's a scholar of groipers, period. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2208.24s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he is a groper as a groper himself. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2211.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, same type of burger brains. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2214.04s)]
*  They don't care about war outside the borders of the USA. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2216.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like they also don't understand. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2218.8399999999997s)]
*  They also don't understand like war overseas [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2222.68s)]
*  is directly coming from your coffers, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2226.92s)]
*  money that could be spent on building roads. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2230.6s)]
*  OK, that's why I brought the Eisenhower [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2233.32s)]

*  I've talked about that before. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2238.1200000000003s)]
*  And it's not like Eisenhower was a good dude, you know? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2239.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, he talks about it's like he leaves the White House. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2241.84s)]
*  I mean, well, that's like a case, though, of like, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2244.32s)]
*  imagine a guy just like helped like murder an entire family in a house. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2246.4s)]
*  And like as he's leaving the house and like wiping the blood off his hands, he's like, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2249.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, we should really be concerned about, you know, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2253.6800000000003s)]
*  concerned about violence in our society. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2255.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, he's totally right. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2257.92s)]
*  But it's sort of like his credibility is a little annihilated. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2259.2000000000003s)]
*  By the time he's talking about it. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2262.76s)]
*  I mean, also, I think like the these types of people also just sort of like [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2265.44s)]
*  resent thinking about like the world as an interconnected entity and that like [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2269.56s)]
*  there isn't really a world in which like America is apart from the world [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2273.84s)]
*  and vice versa, that it's like, you know, our fates are [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2277.56s)]
*  are somewhat interconnected here. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2281.64s)]
*  Our media does everything in its power to make it seem as though [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2283.2s)]
*  that's just happening over there. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2287.4s)]
*  And that is by design. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2289.48s)]
*  So you don't recognize that what's happening over there actually harm you. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2291.12s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2296.08s)]
*  But that is also part of the reason why [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2298.48s)]
*  Americans can fancy themselves as a peace loving nation. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2301.44s)]
*  That is the that is the irony there, which gives a unique opportunity [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2306.6s)]
*  for a reasonable politician to come out and [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2310.92s)]
*  and truly advocate for a different vision of American foreign policy, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2314.48s)]
*  because the only person that presents themselves as a peaceful dove, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2319.36s)]
*  even though they clearly aren't, cannot be someone like Donald Trump. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2324.44s)]
*  And that is what has happened in at least in 2016. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2328.56s)]
*  And certainly this past election cycle. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2332.36s)]
*  And I kept reminding people of this reality over and over again, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2334.92s)]
*  as Kamala Harris was running around with Liz Cheney [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2339.44s)]
*  and simultaneously saying, we're going to have the most lethal military [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2343.44s)]
*  of all time. And liberals are coming here in my chat and be like, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2346.24s)]
*  what do you think the military does? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2349.64s)]
*  Stupid, of course, is supposed to be lethal. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2351.04s)]
*  It's like. And also it goes to like the idea that it's, you know, like, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2353.12s)]
*  I mean, one of the things to me that just sort of sticks out is that it's, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2356.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, what you were saying earlier, it's like, yeah, like when we do invest [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2359.48s)]
*  in these things, by the way, because they're happening elsewhere in the world [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2361.8799999999997s)]
*  and we feel a need to influence them, that's money that we are just sucking [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2365.24s)]
*  and sucking and sucking away from things that like require massive investment [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2368.64s)]
*  in both like human and financial terms. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2373.4s)]
*  I mean, we have plenty of shortages of I mean, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2376.56s)]
*  has anybody had a lot of fun getting a doctor easily lately? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2379.2000000000003s)]
*  Like it's just the whole so obviously out of whack. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2382.6s)]
*  I don't really know how somebody could like think about it [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2387.1600000000003s)]
*  on those kinds of practical terms and determine that like what we really need [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2389.84s)]
*  is to make sure that like Minutemen missiles are firing at the best capability [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2393.32s)]
*  for the next 50 years, as opposed to like having, you know, like lead out of the water. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2396.84s)]
*  This is, I think, a more honest approach. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2401.24s)]
*  What this guy is doing here is an infinitely more honest approach than the [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2403.4s)]
*  the crybaby perceived victimhood that I hear from liberal Zionists. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2407.44s)]

*  I'm not letting him make money off of things that he clips out of context. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2674.32s)]
*  Once again, the entire video in and of itself [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2680.44s)]
*  is an assortment of clips from your sex pest community. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2684.92s)]
*  OK. Me reacting to it would then [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2689.64s)]
*  give him another opportunity to just cut clips out of context as he has done [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2694.04s)]
*  since the video came out. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2698.2000000000003s)]
*  If he wants to, he can debate me. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2699.92s)]

*  I want to think like having like, you know, glanced at what was the [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2726.64s)]
*  the aforementioned video in full that he wants you to watch like it's like [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2729.92s)]
*  it's like three out of it's like three out of context. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2734.36s)]
*  Children stacked in a trench coat and called something more comprehensive. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2736.88s)]
*  Yeah, I showed I showed Noah a piece of it this morning [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2740.4s)]
*  because I'm still entertaining whether or not I'm still entertaining, whether or not [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2744.36s)]
*  I should do a response because there's so much so much like unfettered [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2748.2000000000003s)]
*  Hasbro in it. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2753.8s)]
*  Well, it's like a combination of that, plus like what you were saying, like [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2755.88s)]
*  inventive ways to take you out of context, increasingly inventive ways to take [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2759.6s)]
*  you out of like one of my favorite ones is when he he's like, I'm an easily tricked adult [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2764.56s)]
*  and Hassan actually tricked me into believing that he didn't have radical opinions. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2771.2s)]
*  And then he actually Hassan's commentary on liberals being able to be manipulated. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2775.8399999999997s)]
*  What if that means that he was easily tricking me? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2780.6s)]
*  He pulled up. He got an ice cream truck. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2785.04s)]
*  Yeah. He put on the music. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2787.16s)]
*  He came to my block. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2789.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, I played the ice cream song and there was no ice cream. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2791.2799999999997s)]
*  There was only a mass. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2795.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, he's like, I'm, I'm a I'm a fucking 40 year old adult [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2796.8399999999997s)]
*  who is the stupidest person you've ever met. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2802.72s)]
*  But of course, that's also not even correct, because like, it's not stupidity. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2805.9199999999996s)]
*  It's he is nefarious because he deliberately [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2812.12s)]
*  he deliberately cut the podcast. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2816.8799999999997s)]
*  Interview that he did with me, OK, in a way to make it seem as though I was telling him like, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2821.3199999999997s)]
*  oh, I just love like, you know, I just want things to be like Norway. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2826.4799999999996s)]
*  OK. And in that conversation behind me, as always, is a fucking USSR Yushanka [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2830.52s)]
*  and a matryoshka doll of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin in full in broad display. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2838.52s)]
*  OK, you can clearly see it. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2845.12s)]
*  What did Ethan do when he was retelling this conversation that took place? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2847.44s)]
*  He cut it. He cut it from the frame, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2853.88s)]
*  because even he realized that that would look really stupid. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2857.2400000000002s)]
*  He's lying about, you know, he never represented himself as a radical. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2862.84s)]
*  He never represented himself as a radical. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2866.16s)]
*  But let me just make sure that this Lenin thing, which, by the way, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2868.4s)]
*  will remain in the frame to other clips I cut to this video. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2872.92s)]
*  Let's make sure that one stays out of frame for this, because that would really [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2876.68s)]
*  make me look fucking stupid if I continued to say that Hassan was misrepresenting [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2880.44s)]
*  that he thought that he was something radical. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2885.84s)]
*  And there was like a giant thing of Lenin just to the right of his head. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2887.84s)]
*  Might make me look like a dumbass. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2892.0s)]
*  It undercuts his point, I don't know, which is ironic, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2895.36s)]
*  because if you go back to that podcast from like fucking how many years ago, from twenty, twenty one, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2898.0s)]
*  the reason why I had a conversation with him before we even started the Leftovers [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2902.68s)]
*  podcast together, where I very clearly explained to him my political positions [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2907.72s)]
*  a million times over was because I said America deserve nine eleven. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2912.72s)]
*  That entire conversation revolves around me describing to him the concept of blowback. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2919.7599999999998s)]
*  OK, yeah. Exactly. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2926.88s)]
*  No, I know being here for that is great, is extra funny. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2929.96s)]
*  I mean, here's the look, having like seen a bit of it, like my impression of it is that [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2932.96s)]
*  like because like the narrative arc of like Hassan is like master deceiver, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2936.7200000000003s)]
*  like it doesn't really make sense. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2941.4s)]
*  It does seem to me that instead, like what it is, is like an attempt to like retcon [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2944.64s)]
*  a reason that Ethan doesn't like, you know, like it is. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2949.0s)]
*  It's not it's like it's it's coming up with something that wasn't there [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2951.96s)]
*  that has to be like an explanation for how you got into, you know, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2956.68s)]
*  like how you made everybody really upset about how you made everybody call, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2961.44s)]
*  you know, like, say, Zionist is a slur or whatever. Yeah. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2965.0s)]
*  All of this is your fault and is very little to do [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2967.88s)]
*  with like the secular change in opinion toward this fucking issue. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2972.2000000000003s)]
*  As a result of October 7th, it is because of the brain worms [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2975.56s)]
*  that you have slowly but surely used to infect both your listeners [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2979.28s)]
*  and also the people you've duped into being, you know, like, it's like, yeah, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2983.0s)]
*  it's a fucking conspiracy that you've run. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2986.36s)]
*  It's a great it's a multi-year game. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2988.6400000000003s)]
*  Tom Ripley over here. Yeah, no, it's it's funny. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2990.92s)]
*  Like one of my favorite things that haters of mine do [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2993.6800000000003s)]
*  is when they will like go and find something that I've said on a podcast [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=2997.6400000000003s)]
*  or even on my own broadcast and go, oh, look, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3003.4s)]

*  We found we found a secret thing about Hassan and it's like, hey, dumbass, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3010.44s)]
*  I said it out loud on a fucking podcast. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3015.44s)]
*  Why do you how can your argument, how can your argument simultaneously [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3017.48s)]
*  be that I'm hiding? I'm sheltering the truth from the public. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3021.2400000000002s)]

*  This is a part of I would say it's a part of Project Esther, which was the [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3079.88s)]
*  the the Heritage Foundation operation that paired along with Project 2025, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3084.6s)]
*  where they were going to actively target, you know, any sort of heritage. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3091.16s)]
*  Is it you? I don't remember if Heritage was the group. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3096.0s)]

*  I mean, maybe it was, but no, no, no, it is heritage. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3110.08s)]
*  But like they're basically trying to do like Canary Mission style actions. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3112.04s)]
*  I mean, my impression was always to that they like saw the ground [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3117.24s)]
*  that they got with 2025 and they're like, this is like an amazing blueprint [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3120.08s)]

*  When you act your age and generally address the real criticism [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3139.4799999999996s)]
*  you have instead of playing up a caricature to purely. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3141.7999999999997s)]
*  And you know what? Actually, you know what? I will say, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3143.9599999999996s)]

*  It's like, is that saying you if you criticize me, you must like Trump [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3154.56s)]
*  and think America is great. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3157.48s)]
*  Someone should ask him why he thinks all of his critics, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3158.8s)]
*  including his former fans, why he considers them all to be rabid, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3162.68s)]
*  anti-Semitic terror lovers, because that's what it is. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3166.76s)]

*  Well, I think it's just awesome to like say to demand that somebody [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3179.2s)]
*  stop caricaturing their opponent's positions by caricaturing your position. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3182.48s)]
*  Yeah. That's a pretty good way to have me. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3187.72s)]
*  Yeah. And what I do love about these guys, though, is that they never actually have [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3191.36s)]
*  like the criticism is just vibes based. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3196.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, because also like the criticism is not a criticism, it's a disagreement. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3199.04s)]
*  And it's like really hard to say, like to turn like, I disagree with you [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3203.68s)]
*  into like something that's like a stirring fucking. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3207.76s)]

*  Tell me where we should respond to. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3219.12s)]
*  I ask the question, like, what are the issues? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3220.32s)]
*  Like, what is your what is the real criticism you have of me? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3223.16s)]
*  And you went no real response as usual, only further on the loony [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3227.8s)]
*  lib to not being quizzical about what it is that's being asked of you. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3231.84s)]
*  Well, well, well. Yeah. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3236.72s)]
*  Also, yeah, Noah, you are you are [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3238.0s)]
*  getting a little wild after fucking only three streams [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3241.2s)]

*  But yeah, if you have if you have a real criticism, you can let it be known. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3249.04s)]
*  You know, instead of just vaguely gesturing to the bad vibes overall. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3255.48s)]
*  I mean, I am having sympathy that it is like this stuff does cross your eyeballs [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3261.6400000000003s)]
*  at different points throughout the day. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3265.76s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, a thousand times a day anyway. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3267.2000000000003s)]

*  You go to fucking easy on these people. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3272.96s)]
*  No, because if I go too hard, then they clip it and then they post [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3274.88s)]
*  the clip compilations being like, oh, look at how mad he is at his own chat, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3278.52s)]
*  bringing up reasonable criticisms over and over again when there's no criticism [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3282.56s)]
*  to be fucking had, you know. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3286.68s)]
*  This was funny as well. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3290.32s)]
*  We're going to get to this, too. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3291.56s)]
*  But before I do that, of course, DOJ, HHS, ED and GSA announced [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3292.6s)]
*  initial cancellation of grants and contracts to Columbia University worth [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3296.96s)]
*  four hundred million dollars. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3300.2400000000002s)]
*  OK, now it's this is definitely a ridiculous thing that they're doing. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3303.6400000000003s)]
*  And if college campuses don't quickly recognize that this is going to inevitably [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3309.6000000000004s)]
*  turn on them as well, OK, if their reaction to this is no, no, no, you don't understand. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3316.4s)]
*  We need to suppress more Israel criticism, as a matter of fact, and capitulate [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3321.48s)]
*  to this administration instead of trying to engage them in a legal battle [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3326.68s)]
*  by utilizing the preexisting First Amendment rights that you have at your disposal [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3332.24s)]
*  to defend you. OK. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3337.8399999999997s)]
*  You are cooked more tank top streams, no response as usual. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3340.6s)]
*  Shut up. Typical no response. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3345.12s)]
*  Yeah, this is the same playbook. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3347.12s)]
*  OK, McCarthyism will not stop at what these people claim [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3349.72s)]
*  is anti-Semitic speech. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3356.56s)]

*  The repression of student protests is what's causing the escalation [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3382.4s)]
*  that causes the man for more aggressive crackdowns that cause more escalation. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3385.48s)]
*  The feds and donors and ideologues are thus less and less satisfied. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3388.8s)]
*  At a certain point, it makes financial sense on top of the moral obligation [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3393.04s)]
*  to cease funding genocide and apartheid to just meet the students demands, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3396.12s)]

*  besides like a somewhat more intensified version of what they're already doing, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3441.0s)]
*  which is to just like harass anybody who says anything about Palestine in public. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3445.16s)]
*  You know what? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3450.08s)]

*  anti-Semitic by definition is anti-Semitic, but enough people believe [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3454.96s)]

*  That's it. So it's not like a minority position. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3510.92s)]
*  It's unironically the even by the the glib [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3513.7200000000003s)]
*  liberal standards of like a minority should not let the majority define [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3518.8s)]
*  is better suited when and something that I actually brought up [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3523.2000000000003s)]
*  when talking to Ethan the last time we ever had a debate on this stuff [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3527.92s)]
*  where he ended up crying at the end of it because he thought that is [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3533.28s)]
*  this chat was too mean to him, calling him a Zionist, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3537.44s)]
*  which he said was anti-Semitic. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3541.96s)]
*  Now he also says 90 percent of Jews are Zionists. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3543.28s)]
*  So if you call a Jewish person a Zionist, then you're anti-Semitic. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3546.56s)]
*  But also, if you even criticize Zionism, you're also anti-Semitic [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3549.84s)]
*  because all Jews are Zionists and you're using Zionists as a substitute for Jew. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3553.12s)]
*  That is literally the argument that he brought forward. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3557.24s)]
*  So the real minority in this circumstance would be Palestinians. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3560.0s)]
*  OK, the real victims in this circumstance are the Palestinians. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3566.0s)]
*  They are the ones who are harmed by Israel's actions, by Israel's [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3569.64s)]
*  ethno-supremacist, ethno-religious supremacist ideology. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3573.3199999999997s)]
*  OK, they are the ones who set and dictate the terms. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3578.0s)]
*  That is the conversation that we had about from the river to the sea, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3583.12s)]
*  Palestine will be free. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3587.08s)]
*  OK, he even considered that to be a bridge too far. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3589.0s)]
*  He considered that to be anti-Semitic. That was my red line. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3593.24s)]
*  I said, I'm not going to back down from this. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3595.3999999999996s)]
*  It is I'm not going to allow people who defend Israel to dictate the terms [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3597.7999999999997s)]
*  of what that emancipatory slogan means, because that is identical to saying [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3604.64s)]
*  Black Lives Matter means you want to kill white people. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3610.52s)]
*  OK, that's ridiculous. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3613.52s)]
*  That's a ridiculous way to, you know, that's a ridiculous assessment [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3615.16s)]
*  on an emancipatory slogan. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3619.52s)]
*  It's just so stupid. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3621.8799999999997s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3623.8799999999997s)]
*  Like I emphasize something I was saying earlier about Zionism as like an ism [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3624.7999999999997s)]
*  and Zionism as like a practice, as like a thing in the world. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3629.08s)]
*  And the idea of like, yeah, like if you were if like we were having like [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3632.6s)]
*  like this, like, you know, in the imaginary like set of conversations [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3636.96s)]
*  about like, you know, do Jews get to have a homeland? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3640.56s)]
*  I guess everybody, you know, like who comes from a place like in that framing, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3642.96s)]
*  like gets to have a homeland. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3646.2400000000002s)]
*  But like in practice, what we're describing is like, you know, dispossession [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3647.96s)]
*  and oppression sustained over time in the guise of making that homeland. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3651.6s)]
*  Like, that's just not like a like you can't. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3655.84s)]
*  I mean, like if you believe that that's an essential character of like [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3658.88s)]
*  what a people gets to does like, yeah, that's pretty fascist. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3662.08s)]
*  That's pretty that that's what I mean. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3664.76s)]
*  That's that's like a that is the exact kind of like nationalist [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3667.08s)]
*  like ferment that we associate with like the worst horrors of the 20th century, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3awrYRd8o&t=3670.8799999999997s)]
