# Chris Cuomo FURIOUS Over AOC | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg)
*  This is such a funny Chiron developing story. Chris's father is former New York governor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=0.0s)]
*  Mario Cuomo. What's developing about that bro that developed so long ago the dead. It [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=5.48s)]
*  can't develop any further than it has. You know what I mean. Chris Cuomo was so upset. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  I love G. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=21.76s)]
*  He is not afraid of migrants as Trump may like, but they are afraid of these guys, Iranian [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=22.76s)]
*  nationals with jihadist sympathies. Bro, bro, what are you? You let them in with a laxity [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  that AOC and other radicals insisted on. And the far left is actively embracing people [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=39.040000000000006s)]
*  who are the enemy. Pro Hamas, people who chant globalize the Intifada, the Palestinian [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  uprising characterized by over 130 suicide bombings. Really? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=52.48s)]
*  Remember what? I'm glad that I just had that long conversation about how like what's so [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=56.72s)]
*  annoying to me about Islamophobia and the way that I experienced it, the way that I [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  see it is like, I know what he's saying is racist. Many of you know what he's saying [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=68.64s)]
*  is racist. But I know for a fact that he's not going to get punished for this. As a matter [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  of fact, not a single person in his orbit is going to turn around and be like, dog, aren't [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=78.92s)]
*  you supposed to be like a Democrat? What are you saying right now? It's that it's that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=84.0s)]
*  extra anger. It's that resentment and anger that I have knowing full well that society [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=88.48s)]
*  doesn't check this kind of attitude at all. Look, man, it's his brother. Don't lie. You [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  wouldn't do the same amount. No, not to this degree. Are you kidding me? Christopher C. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Cuomo, enough with the fake division sides and parties. These extreme Islamists want [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=103.84s)]
*  to kill both sides. Extremism and home and abroad are the threat. Anyone make an excuse [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=107.22s)]
*  for these types are the part of the problem. What I snabs 11 Iranian migrants, including [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=111.22s)]
*  suspected as border patrol warrants a possible sleeper cells. Wait, what? So you saw like [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=116.06s)]
*  you saw ice grab Iranian migrants and you just automatically assume that they're is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=122.7s)]
*  that what's going on there? They're sleeper cells. But you're pro ice now. Yeah. Ice is [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=129.14s)]
*  deporting Iranian migrants on us soil to beef up the narrative that there's like sleeper [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=134.78s)]
*  cells in the country. And this guy's a willing participant in this propaganda operation. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=141.78s)]
*  Nice. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=146.94s)]
*  And I'm not picking on AOC. I respect her success in developing a following. I just [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=147.94s)]
*  think that she's killing her party. She is a deranged form of Democrat. And I'm pointing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=155.38s)]
*  her out because she's at the top of the food chain. A recent CNN poll found she's the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=162.9s)]
*  top Democratic leader who best reflects the core values of the Democratic Party. And this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=168.26000000000002s)]
*  is by Democratic. Wait, there's a reason why you're saying they when referring to the Democratic [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=175.06s)]
*  Party. And it's the same reason why you don't understand why AOC is best reflective of the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=181.62s)]
*  core values of the Democratic Party is because you're not a Democrat. Not only are you not a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=189.86s)]
*  Democrat, but you also don't realize why people think AOC best reflects the core values of the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=193.94000000000003s)]
*  Democratic Party. The reason why is because of the things that you are saying are extremist. It's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=200.5s)]
*  so funny to point to her success as a leader in the party and then be like, Hey, the things that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=208.18s)]
*  made other Democrats consider you to be the leader in the party, stop doing that. But that's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  literally why people are saying it you moron. What is wrong with you? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=219.38s)]
*  Voters. She ranked higher than Harris, Jeffries, Newsome, even Obama. Are you kidding me? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=224.82s)]
*  She couldn't be less about what made the Democratic Party great. And I get to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=233.14s)]
*  wait. So you're saying she should moderate so she is less resembling of the voice of the Democratic [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=238.82s)]
*  Party. Like I don't get it. It just doesn't make any sense. Say that she is not a real one. I was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=245.06s)]
*  raised by a real one. Google Mario Cuomo, Google Teddy Kennedy, Google Daniel Patrick Moynihan, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=252.02s)]
*  Google any of the legends. You know the name. Wait, Teddy Kennedy. I'm sorry. What? I love that. He [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  said Google my dad, by the way, Mark Cuomo's his dad, Kennedy, Google Daniel Patrick Moynihan, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=268.74s)]
*  Google any of the legends. You know the names. Remember the ideas. Mario Cuomo was a child of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=274.82s)]
*  immigrants. He was considered less than himself. He would have never allowed a porous border [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=283.46s)]
*  or fake fights and socialistic calls for free everything, especially when there was a real bill [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=288.58s)]
*  to battle for Medicaid and tax breaks for the working class. AOC is popular because extremism [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=294.34s)]
*  drives social media and magnifies minorities. Pissing people off pays off. But radicals keep [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=301.14s)]
*  missing the rational majority. AOC and the radical left are the party of 20% when the country is the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=308.18s)]
*  other 80%. Only 4% say Iran getting a nuke is not important. Only 18% say that men who identify as [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=315.62s)]
*  women shouldn't play in women's or girls' sports. Only one in three voters say foreign students who [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=324.82s)]
*  support should stay here. Only 16% of Americans want deportations to stop. Only 27% of voters [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  support abolishing ICE and forget about- One fucker's coming in trying to buy and sell my [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=340.5s)]
*  house, bro. This is crazy. In the middle of the goddamn workday, I didn't hear a dang thing that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=346.34s)]
*  Cuomo was saying because I was yelling at the door. He was coming to my house trying to be like, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=351.22s)]
*  hey, I would like to buy and sell your house. No thanks, man. The hell out of here, bro. The door [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=356.26000000000005s)]
*  is not open. Audio only here. Is this Fox News? No, it's NewsNation with premier progressive [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=363.46000000000004s)]
*  commentator Christopher Colombo. But radicals keep missing the rational. This is such a funny [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=370.58000000000004s)]
*  Chiron. Developing story. Chris's father is former New York governor Mario Cuomo. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=378.66s)]
*  What's developing about that, bro? That developed so long ago, the dead, it can't develop any further [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  than it has. You know what I mean? That is the most developed story of all time. There is nothing [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=390.66s)]
*  more developing on that front. Okay. Breaking news. Christopher Cuomo, son of Mario Cuomo- [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=396.1s)]
*  He's not developing. He's decaying. Majority AOC and the radical left are the party of 20% [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=408.66s)]
*  when the country is the other 80%. Only 4% say Iran getting a nuke is not important. Only 18% say, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=418.02000000000004s)]
*  dude, dude, awesome. What a fantastic way to cover this story. 85% of the country on that same [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  YouGov poll says, 85% of that poll says they do not want to go to war with Iran. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=436.66s)]
*  18% biological men can't compete in girls and women's sports. Overwhelming majority still say [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=444.18s)]
*  trans people are unjustly prosecuted in this country. Remember that. Okay. This is hyper niche [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=449.86s)]
*  and hyper specific. 33% foreign students who can support terror can stay in the US. Don't even know [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=455.78000000000003s)]
*  where you got this from. But again, overwhelmingly unpopular to deport people, students [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=461.22s)]
*  for the crime of exercising their First Amendment rights. Overwhelmingly unpopular. It's also [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  unconstitutional. It's the most American thing you can do. Bitch ass. 16% say deportations is stop. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=477.54s)]
*  Deportations are unpopular. Again, majority disapproval for Trump's deportation. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=485.86s)]
*  27% support ICE. They use the wrong statistic. Oh, oh, so they just lied. They just lied. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=492.58s)]
*  As in only 27% support ICE. 27% support abolishing ICE is so stupid. Rolling on the floor laughing. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=500.02000000000004s)]
*  You are hyper niche. I'm hyper niche. I got a stadium. I got two stadiums full of in here [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=509.22s)]
*  watching. We have a larger broader audience than mainstream news. And you're talking to me as though [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=516.34s)]
*  News Nation, which can't crack 1000 views on YouTube every episode is more is less niche [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=522.9s)]
*  and more broadly popular. Are you out of your mind, dude? There's numbers on the board right here. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=530.58s)]
*  Their videos don't even crack 1000 on YouTube. This is perhaps the worst. Like whenever, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=537.06s)]
*  whenever haters come in here, okay, whatever haters come in here, there are times when, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=542.9s)]
*  when there's, there's more opportune times to just like try to strike at me with some shit like, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=547.8599999999999s)]
*  Oh dude, you fell off. Oh dude, you're so niche. Brother Chris Cuomo's brother, Andrew Cuomo, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=552.5799999999999s)]
*  sneak dissed me at the New York mayoral race at the debates. What are you talking about? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=560.0999999999999s)]
*  And guess what? The guy I was backing just won the primary. So I don't know, man. This is perhaps [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=566.66s)]
*  the worst least opportune time to come in here and be like, bro, you're so niche, bro. You so you fell [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=574.1s)]
*  off. You know what I mean? Worst time to do this. Check back in a couple of weeks when things quiet [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=579.62s)]
*  down. You know what I mean? Men who identify as women shouldn't play in women's or girls sports. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=585.38s)]
*  Anyway, all those statistics are bunk. They just lied about it. What is this? Less than half of [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=591.4599999999999s)]
*  Democrats support abolishing it only 27% oppose it. Democrats are more likely to support oppose. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=596.58s)]
*  Democrats are more likely to support than oppose abolishing ice, but less than half of Democrats, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=601.46s)]
*  47% support abolishing it and 27% oppose it. So 27% or 27% oppose abolishing ice. They didn't [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=605.46s)]
*  misrepresent this. It doesn't matter. It's still a fucking deeply unpopular institution, even across [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=615.94s)]
*  the board. They did. No, they didn't misrepresent it. Only 27% of Americans say they strongly or [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=621.38s)]
*  somewhat support abolishing ice. No, they did. We look at the video. No support abolishing ice [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=627.7s)]
*  chatters. 43% view ice very or somewhat unfavorably. 45% of Americans have a very or somewhat favorable [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=633.38s)]
*  view of ice in early February. 50% had a favorable view of ice and 35% had an unfavorable one. Since [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=639.78s)]
*  then Democrats have become much less favorable towards ice. 13% net favorability in February [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=647.38s)]
*  minus and minus 68 now. Oh, wait, next bullet point. Only 27% of Americans say they strongly [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=652.66s)]
*  or somewhat support abolishing ice while 45% strongly or somewhat oppose this oppose abolishing [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=661.62s)]
*  ice. Yes, they're saying 27% of Americans support abolishing ice. 45% support 45% support ice. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=669.06s)]
*  They didn't misunderstand the the number they're saying. 27% of Americans and 47% [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=677.9399999999999s)]
*  of Democrats support abolishing ice. Yes. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Zezb2e1mg&t=685.3s)]
