# Hasan At The Campus Of Cambridge University's Union
**HasanAbi:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY)
*  But no, my college was only established as one 12 years ago, so the builders were old, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=0.0s)]
*  but they decided to make it out as a college. So there's 31 now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=5.2s)]
*  Wow. Well I think Oxford have, how many colleges? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=10.96s)]
*  Oxford have more. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=14.32s)]
*  Oxford have more. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  They have 40. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=15.76s)]
*  30, yeah, maybe 40, I'm not sure. We don't, we don't, we don't. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=16.4s)]
*  Wow, we don't even bring up Oxford. No reason. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=19.6s)]
*  No, we don't have to talk about that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=22.0s)]
*  No reason. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=23.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=24.16s)]
*  It's on site, Oxford. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=24.64s)]
*  If you talk to him about Oxford during the talk, he'll get a big cheer. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=27.2s)]
*  Oh, that's a good, that's a good point to it, to me. Yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=30.0s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna flip it. Let's do it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=42.88s)]
*  What's up everybody? We're live. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=47.44s)]
*  And we're alive. Let's see if you can see my, hold on, let me take a look. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=50.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's it. Oh yeah, your mic is hot by the way. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=54.72s)]
*  Oh, hi there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=57.6s)]
*  So it's all good. Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=58.8s)]
*  Oh, do we figure out how to mute it if necessary? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=61.36s)]
*  You'll figure it out later. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=64.88s)]
*  Okay, whatever. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=66.0s)]
*  What's up folks? I'm live and alive from Cambridge University's union, Cambridge Union, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=67.2s)]
*  in these sacred halls of oratory combat with a thousand year tradition. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=74.88s)]
*  More than a thousand year, no, not a thousand year tradition, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  but almost a thousand year tradition. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=86.72s)]
*  And I'm going to be desecrating these halls with my silliness, but I was invited to come speak here [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=88.8s)]
*  on an issue, an important issue that's near and dear to me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=95.52s)]
*  And I'm going to be over there, right on that podium right there where the likes of Jeffrey [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=99.2s)]
*  Sachs and Mercheimer has stood before or stood behind and delivered excellent speeches. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  We're going to be doing a Q&A afterwards, a moderated Q&A with my friend here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=110.8s)]
*  Hello. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=114.72s)]
*  Um, so how does the Oxford, how does, sorry, we don't like Oxford. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=115.78s)]
*  No, we don't like Oxford. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=119.78s)]
*  How does, how does Cambridge Union work? You want to explain that to them? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=120.5s)]
*  Cambridge Union, basically we were founded in 1815, the oldest debating society in the world. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=123.38s)]
*  We have lots of members who are Cambridge students or they live in Cambridge and they can come, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=127.94s)]
*  come to these events. We have debates and we have high profile excellent speakers like Mr. Hassan here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=134.42s)]
*  Um, yeah, it'll be a lovely evening. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=139.78s)]
*  Have you guys ever had a Twitch room before? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=142.82s)]
*  Have we had a streamer before? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=145.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=146.58s)]
*  Hmm. I'm not sure. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=146.9s)]
*  I might be the first. I don't think that they've ever had a streamer before. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=148.82s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=153.22s)]
*  I know some people have invited some in the past that we didn't go through with. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=153.94s)]
*  We have had YouTubers. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=159.22s)]
*  Yeah, YouTubers. Who'd you guys have? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=160.34s)]
*  We had Casper Lee. We had, um, Willenny and Memeulous. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=162.18s)]
*  Quite British, they've been British mostly. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=168.26s)]
*  Might not be a... [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=168.5s)]
*  So you've never had a Turkish American Twitch streamer before. So that's a first. Let's go. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=169.22s)]
*  First streamer. Um, has Ben Shapiro ever rolled in? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=173.78s)]
*  Ben Shapiro was here last year. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=177.61999999999998s)]
*  Was that controversial when he came? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=179.22s)]
*  Um, well, I mean, it was. There was no protests around the thing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=181.14s)]
*  Unlike Peter Thiel and, um, and Sam Altman as well. Also got protested. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=190.17999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=191.14s)]
*  I remember the Peter Thiel conversation. I was talking with him earlier about that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=191.62s)]
*  He was very sweaty and very nervous, it seems, but we'll see. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=194.66s)]
*  Um, for those of you who are wondering at home, Hasan, did you write a speech? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=200.5s)]
*  Uh, did you prepare for it? He was worried about it as well. He asked me. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=204.9s)]
*  I'd seen. I'd seen. I had faith. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=208.66s)]
*  Yeah, I did. I did write a speech. And it's somewhat long, I think. It's a little bit longer [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=210.9s)]
*  than I thought it was going to be. I got some help from Noah Colwin as well. A friend of the show. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=217.22s)]
*  Blowback podcast creator, former, uh, former senior editor of Jewish Currents. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=222.82s)]
*  He also helped me touch it up a little bit, luckily. So it'll be, it'll be a decent speech, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=229.7s)]
*  I think. It won't be super fiery or anything, but, um, we're going to do a speech and the format is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  I speak and then we sit down on those chairs and, uh, we will have a moderated Q and A where you're [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=240.18s)]
*  going to be asking some questions, right? Just like a little conversation. And then after that, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=247.78s)]
*  they're going to open it up to everyone that's in this room, which sounds crazy. I didn't realize [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=251.62s)]
*  it was like that. We're just, I've watched videos before, but yeah, people just like sit here and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=258.1s)]
*  they're like, it'll be like gray names. You know how I like yell at you guys in the chat sometimes [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=263.7s)]
*  when you chime in and you chirp at me over some silly shit? Can I curse here? I feel like it's a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=268.1s)]
*  It's disrespectful. Don't worry. It's disrespectful to the oratory tradition. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=273.46s)]
*  Okay. I got the pass. It's allowed. But yeah. Um, but before we do that, we have some limited time [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=277.7s)]
*  before we get set up, uh, in the next like 10 minutes, but we wanted to just like quickly look [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=285.62s)]
*  around the campus. Um, we already got like a little tour ahead of time, but I wanted to show you guys [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=290.5s)]
*  around the campus to see how insane it is that these guys not only run this as students, but also [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  simultaneously. They're, this is a castle. Like these guys literally go to school in a castle. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=303.14s)]
*  So yeah, what's up guys? Where do we, how do we get out of here? Uh, we, we should be able to get [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=310.9s)]
*  out of these doors. They have been locked for, uh, for security reasons, but straight down there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=317.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably best. Hopefully I won't be too cold. I have a jacket normally that I would [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=324.66s)]
*  put on on top of this when I'm outside, but it was too hot. The other one. Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=328.42s)]
*  Well, so it was a problem in Britain as we know. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=335.22s)]
*  I might be the first speaker that they ever had that passed the tarp and it sheds it completely [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=342.66s)]
*  when we're outside. Let's see. Hopefully we don't, uh, when we're moving away from the, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=347.62s)]
*  I think it's four of the kings. Yeah. No, it's not. It's good. Um, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=355.46s)]
*  well, yeah, I might be the first speaker who, uh, actually ends up popping the tarp, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=362.42s)]
*  shedding the tarp and, and showcasing the guns inside. Um, cause it is very hot in there. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=368.74s)]
*  What's going on? I think we've had some interesting outfits in the past. Oh, really? Okay. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=376.02s)]
*  I don't think you'll be the first. They're impossibly polite by the way. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=381.3s)]
*  And I don't know if it's like you guys being British or what that's, it's crazy. I've been, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  I've been unhinged this whole time. So we're going to go down, go to King's college. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. You haven't done your British accent yet, which I'm trying not to do it. I feel like it's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=399.06s)]
*  disrespectful to do to someone when they're in my vicinity. You know what I mean? Like from the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=404.5s)]
*  comforts of my home. Yeah. That's the appropriate place for it. Far away from British people. It's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=409.06s)]
*  easy. Yeah. It's effective. But when I'm here, it just like, it doesn't face with us in the, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=414.58s)]
*  in the flesh. Yeah. It's scary. What do you mean? What do you say? Are you talking shit? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=420.98s)]
*  No. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=433.46s)]
*  Oh yeah. Mr. I just got back from Japan. He's been complaining. March has been, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  chat, March has been complaining this entire time. Uh, nonstop about how disorganized everything is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=445.78s)]
*  and how dreary it is, how the food is not up to his standard from Japan, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  how nothing is like Japan. Nothing compares freaking weave. Yeah. Cool gate. Yeah. Look at [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=461.78s)]
*  that gate. Bro. This is the school. This is literally just straight up the school. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=468.09999999999997s)]
*  Like imagine going to school and it's just a castle. I feel like, I feel like there's ghosts. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=473.7s)]
*  They say there aren't, but like you have to, there's so much, like there's so much carnage [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=480.1s)]
*  that has taken place here. Like, Oh my God, you scared the shit out of me. That's crazy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=485.78s)]
*  Can I take a picture with you? Yes, it's fine. We were just talking about ghosts. He just popped up. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=491.06s)]
*  I wasn't, I didn't even see you. I was like, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=496.74s)]
*  okay, that was horrible. You got to do another one. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=503.38s)]
*  Oh my God. I've been watching you for the last two years. Every time I eat [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=509.14s)]
*  in my room, you're the video that's playing. Hell yeah. I've gained so much weight because of you. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=513.22s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize for that. Oh my God. I'm sorry. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=518.66s)]
*  Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, hell yeah. All right. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=527.14s)]
*  That was crazy. Is everything good? Yeah. Probably a few ghosts. Maybe all of a common ghost. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=535.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So where were the encampments? We'll see that. Yeah. That's where we're heading. Outside of [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=543.62s)]
*  King's college. Yeah. That's like the university headquarters basically. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=550.74s)]
*  Yeah. You guys also use different language. They're very different terminology for the same shit. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=562.5799999999999s)]
*  College here is high school, right? Yes. Sixth form. It's the same in Turkey too, but I was always, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=568.4200000000001s)]
*  in America, college means college, university. Yeah. And it's even more confusing in Cambridge [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=574.9000000000001s)]
*  because we have colleges which are like these. There's 31 on the makeup. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=579.86s)]
*  So colleges here means what? Like if you're like your specialty? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=590.1s)]
*  No. So basically you have the university of Cambridge and within that there are 31 colleges [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=595.62s)]
*  and each of those, they're where you live. You apply when you join, you apply to a college, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=601.06s)]
*  not the university. That's where you live. That's where they organize your teaching. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=605.46s)]
*  The lectures are centralized, but all the different colleges have their own sort of stuff going on. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=610.02s)]
*  That's crazy. And some are richer than others. So it depends. Okay. So which one's the richest? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=614.58s)]
*  We don't like those guys. No, Trinity and St. John's. Are we beating them with them? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=621.22s)]
*  Is it on site? We are. So what do you guys do? You play Quidditch? What are you playing with [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=627.46s)]
*  these guys? Well, we go juke out over the lacrosse, I think. You guys play lacrosse? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=631.78s)]
*  Well, not me personally. It's known to happen. There is a lacrosse society. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=638.5s)]
*  Okay. So society is like a club. Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Mind out for the bikes. Yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=643.38s)]
*  Don't get killed, March, while trying to film. March is a raw dog in this right now. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=650.82s)]
*  I'm good. Thank you. What was that? Santa Paws? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=660.58s)]
*  Should we have taken it? I feel bad. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=670.1800000000001s)]
*  We're leaving everyone's post. It's duty. So to the right, this is Caius College. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=671.78s)]
*  Is it Caius? Yeah, I'm coming in Caius. They got heads on it. Look. Yeah. Whoa. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=683.06s)]

*  Thank you for being a voice for trans people. Oh, of course. I really, really appreciate it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=697.3s)]
*  Nice to meet you. Yeah, of course. Let's do it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=700.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. Have a good one. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=710.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes, we're just about to arrive to the Senate House now. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=715.3000000000001s)]
*  The Senate House is? Where the encampment was. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=724.1s)]
*  Where the encampment was. That's the administration office. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=727.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's also where people graduate. Got it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=730.42s)]
*  So you saw the ladders. There were ladders that went so people jumped. So can you see there? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=746.0999999999999s)]
*  Is that like a fountain? Yeah, I think so. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=750.66s)]
*  Statues. Oh, people were jumping over this. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=753.62s)]
*  And they were jumping over. Prior, it's just down there. So I'll show you to Kings. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=757.3s)]
*  But with Kings, they barricaded it now with vents in. Wow. Okay. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=762.02s)]
*  That's crazy. What's this? Oh, it's just the church. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=771.38s)]
*  This is Great St. Mary's Church. Great St. Mary's Church. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=775.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the official university church. You have to live within a certain number of miles [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=778.66s)]
*  of this church in order to stay at the university. Oh really? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=782.9s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. What's up, man? Do you mind if I get a picture? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=786.18s)]
*  Yeah, let's do it. Thank you. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=789.54s)]
*  No problem. Your hands are longer. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=791.62s)]
*  All right, I got it. Thank you. I'm a big fan. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=794.02s)]
*  Watch you on like Ferrand and stuff. Hell yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=796.8199999999999s)]
*  Ferrand Mansion? Ferrand Mansion. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=799.06s)]
*  Thank you so much. Hey, chat. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=805.54s)]
*  That's King's Chapel. So this is King's Parade. I would say the most famous street in Kenya. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=806.82s)]
*  Yeah. Whoa, what are these guys doing? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=813.46s)]
*  I mean the most famous street. With the Georgian flag. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=814.82s)]
*  Yeah. Why are they? Are they protesting the Georgian government? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=816.82s)]
*  I imagine, yes, probably. There's often sort of Ukrainian and Georgian protests along here. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=821.0600000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=828.2600000000001s)]
*  I don't think you guys have enough chapels. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=828.9s)]
*  Yeah, we're really short on chapels. We only have about... [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=836.26s)]
*  Not enough churches around here. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=838.5s)]
*  ...40, 100. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=839.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm feeling a lack of gold around. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=843.54s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=847.3s)]
*  Oh, so they barricaded this here so that people can... [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=849.78s)]
*  Yes, so their encampment was on the field over there. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=851.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And how long did it go on for? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=854.42s)]
*  It was a few months. It went on until just past the end of the last academic year. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=859.2199999999999s)]
*  Sure, the encampments are here. No joke. It's cold as shit, dude. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=864.26s)]
*  Yeah. They are... [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=868.42s)]
*  I'm wet. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=869.4599999999999s)]
*  I think it's kind of funny to do a pro-EU Georgian protest in a country that escaped, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=871.38s)]
*  that left the European Union. But I guess the irony... [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=876.7399999999999s)]
*  Shall we stop? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=884.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, we should probably go back, right? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=888.26s)]
*  Back, yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=889.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, that's King's scene. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=890.18s)]
*  There it is. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=894.9799999999999s)]
*  It's King's. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=896.66s)]
*  It'll blend into one. Right, we'll head back. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=900.8199999999999s)]
*  That's the Senate House. That's where we graduate after we finish our undergrad. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=914.66s)]
*  Yeah. For Americans, we don't have any cultural landmarks. We got like, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=919.6999999999999s)]
*  you know, Mickey Mouse and Burger. So going to school in like a castle or like a museum is crazy. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=924.5799999999999s)]
*  You know? It's pretty wild. You don't get used to it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=933.54s)]
*  It's just the Chancellor that... [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=937.2199999999999s)]
*  The Vice Chancellor. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=940.0999999999999s)]
*  It's the Vice Chancellor that... [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=940.9799999999999s)]
*  ...met with... does the graduation. Yeah. I think so. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=943.38s)]
*  That's the best room you can have up there. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=951.4599999999999s)]
*  General tailors and robes makers. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=952.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's like... [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=955.2199999999999s)]
*  Cambridge March and Dice. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=956.02s)]
*  You'll see people walking around with the puffer jackets with their college crests on. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=957.54s)]
*  They'll come from there. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=960.74s)]
*  Oh, so those are all the crests of the colleges? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=962.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=964.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=965.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=966.0999999999999s)]
*  That's cool. And this is the entirety of the campus? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=966.5s)]
*  No, there's... Oh yeah, well this is a map of the center of town. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=971.46s)]
*  We don't really have one campus. It's very spread out. There's a nice little model here. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=974.66s)]
*  So these colleges were warring against one another like in direct hot battle? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=980.1s)]
*  They've had lots of beef over time. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=984.42s)]
*  What's up man? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=986.02s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=986.74s)]

*  So insane. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=994.26s)]
*  You want to take a photo? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=994.82s)]
*  Yeah, sure, sure, sure. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=995.62s)]

*  Because you guys take the photo. Sorry. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=996.82s)]
*  I'm today, though. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=998.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's like... I saw the union was like inviting you. I was like, oh my god, there's no way. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=998.9s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1003.62s)]
*  Oh my god, thank you very much. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1007.62s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1009.7s)]
*  Hope you enjoy it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1010.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. It's great so far. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1011.62s)]
*  So yeah, the colleges were warring against one another. You were talking to my mom earlier about that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1024.1s)]
*  Yeah, they've had some disputes. They backed different sides in like the walls of the roses [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1027.4599999999998s)]
*  and the rich ones backed the right side and the poor ones didn't. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1032.4199999999998s)]
*  Oh, you know, poor and relative towns. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1036.5s)]
*  That's why the poor stayed broke. Is that what happened? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1037.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1039.6999999999998s)]
*  We backed the wrong side in the walls of the roses and the English Civil War. So we were really... [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1041.06s)]
*  You know, it could be going better. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1045.62s)]
*  It's all good. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1049.2199999999998s)]
*  Homerton there, that's... [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1051.86s)]
*  So when you say brand new, it's like 1700. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1053.62s)]
*  So my college was 19th century. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1056.02s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1060.74s)]
*  So it's one of the newer ones. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1061.3s)]
*  That's crazy sentence. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1063.3s)]
*  That's still older than most of America. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1065.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1069.1399999999999s)]
*  But no, my college was only established that's one 12 years ago. So the buildings are old, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1070.74s)]

*  Wow, we don't even bring up Oxford. No reason. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1090.42s)]

*  If you talk to him about Oxford during the talk, you'll get a big cheer. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1098.02s)]

*  I know, I know. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1144.8200000000002s)]
*  Hi, I'm Lee. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1145.3200000000002s)]
*  And Ben Shapiro, science director. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1145.8200000000002s)]
*  Boo. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1148.74s)]
*  Yeah, we have a lot of academics. We have to wait till Thursday here, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1152.5800000000002s)]
*  because we get some local files, really. Do you know Stephen Thrasher? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1156.66s)]
*  I think so. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1163.38s)]
*  And he's quite... He came up, he was talking around the child. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1164.02s)]
*  He's a great student. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1170.66s)]
*  There's never... Before me, there hasn't been an Israel-Palestine-focused [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1183.5400000000002s)]
*  speaker, though, right? Like, I think Merkheimer and Sacks both talked broadly about, like, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1187.46s)]
*  American foreign policy, potentially. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1193.94s)]
*  So here's Schimmer, what's in the debate. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1195.5400000000002s)]
*  This house welcomes the decline of America. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1197.94s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. That's a... I love that. That's a bold ass name for... [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1200.26s)]
*  Did you hear that, Chad? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1205.3799999999999s)]
*  Their last, like, I guess it's a, what is it, debate series? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1206.9s)]
*  Yeah, this was... [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1209.86s)]
*  The house welcomes the decline of America. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1210.82s)]
*  I think we've waited against it, I have to say. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1215.78s)]
*  That is the least surprising thing that I've heard from a British audience. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1218.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1224.02s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. I mean, it's the same in America, don't worry. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1224.52s)]
*  And then tomorrow we have the debate on China. Do you know the topic? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1231.32s)]
*  This house believes the West is hypocritical towards China, is tomorrow's debate. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1235.96s)]
*  Okay, that one is like... That's not very difficult to argue for. Who's arguing? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1239.8799999999999s)]
*  The president of the Union. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1245.4s)]
*  It's, yeah, it's his personal choice. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1247.8s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1250.36s)]
*  Various academics on there, I think. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1252.04s)]
*  Okay, that's cool. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1254.52s)]
*  We're... It's kind of interesting because, like, this is a very... [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1257.72s)]
*  It's a big deliberative body. Both the unions are... [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1261.56s)]
*  And I am very openly anti-debate. I engage in it and I do it from time to time. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1265.8799999999999s)]
*  But for the most part, I'm like... I usually consider it, especially online, the way it works. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1273.32s)]
*  I consider it to be like pseudo-intellectual blood sport. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1279.48s)]
*  I've seen the debate in Oxford, haven't they, in HAL? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1281.88s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the Yosef Haddad one where he got... He had to get escorted out. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1289.5600000000002s)]
*  He's getting a little too spicy. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1295.8000000000002s)]

*  Outside of London, we have only been to Brighton and Birmingham, which is... [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1503.4s)]
*  Why is it at the bottom? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1510.2s)]
*  It was a photo shoot. It was like a work-related thing. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1511.8s)]
*  Yeah, Birmingham leaves much to be desired. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1518.28s)]
*  But Cambridge is very quaint. It's really nice. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1521.64s)]
*  How much are we talking about South Korea today in the Q&A? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1524.52s)]

*  Oh. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1587.56s)]

*  This one's the crazy one. This house welcomes the decline of America. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1601.8s)]
*  And then you got Merzheimer's signature right there. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1607.96s)]

*  Is that considered like a part of the anti-Semitic statute here in the U.K.? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1686.68s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have adopted the IHRA definition. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1690.68s)]

*  15 minutes. Yeah. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1870.0600000000002s)]

*  That's we get a few. It's like very like flip of the coin. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1894.06s)]

*  It's like right in the middle. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1898.7s)]
*  It's, you know, sort of like someone like yourself or sort of complete other side of the spectrum. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1899.5s)]
*  Ben Shapiro, Peter Tills. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1903.5800000000002s)]

*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1907.74s)]
*  Yeah. He kept it short because he was probably trying to dunk on some college kids. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1909.3400000000001s)]
*  He was. There was a whole format where they were like going one by one against him. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1914.38s)]
*  Yeah. I can't like he failed though. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1917.74s)]
*  You know, yeah, we put one of our like best debates at the time up against him. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1920.22s)]

*  It's like, bro, just a bit like. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1927.98s)]
*  Yeah, I remember watching that. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1929.42s)]
*  I remember watching that and I think it was because he does this thing very well where, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1931.5s)]
*  and this is I think one of the shortcomings of debate in my opinion, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1937.9s)]
*  as someone who sometimes participates in it, but is like rather critical of the format in general. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1941.5s)]
*  Um, he's a very skilled orator. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1946.22s)]
*  Like he knows how to weave away from subject matter when he doesn't, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1949.98s)]
*  when he doesn't know the actual truth. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1955.74s)]
*  Like I think, I think it was the girl who brought up the great march of return in 2018. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1957.34s)]
*  And I remember watching his face and him being like just oblivious. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1963.74s)]
*  Like he had no idea what that was. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1969.26s)]
*  And he very quickly, like immediately deflected it back to something else, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1970.78s)]
*  like where he was like in a more comfortable pocket. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1974.46s)]
*  So, you know, some of the shortcomings of debate in general. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1977.3400000000001s)]
*  We have a debate tomorrow. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1981.9s)]
*  This house believes the West is hypocritical towards China. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1983.1000000000001s)]
*  I love that. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1985.58s)]
*  I'd be curious what your thoughts on that would be. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1986.54s)]
*  I mean, yeah, the West has always been hypocritical, not just towards China, just in general. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1988.46s)]
*  So I think, I mean, I'll touch on that a little bit, not about China, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1993.3400000000001s)]
*  but I'll touch on that a little bit tonight. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1997.58s)]
*  I think I'm sure that people will bring questions up in that regard as well. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=1999.74s)]
*  In terms of the numerous times that the United States has vetoed things on the UN [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2004.78s)]
*  despite not being a part of the Rome Statute or even, you know, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2010.22s)]
*  ever really appreciating the existence of the ICC. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2014.14s)]
*  They were very collaborative with the ICC when they were prosecuting Vladimir Putin. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2017.02s)]
*  But when the crosshairs have turned on a very valuable ally, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2022.54s)]
*  like Benjamin and Yahoo and Yoav Galant, all of a sudden it's just, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2026.6200000000001s)]
*  they flipped the switch. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2031.02s)]
*  They're like, this is Banana Republic. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2032.3799999999999s)]
*  These guys are only supposed to go after thugs. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2035.74s)]
*  I can't believe they're doing this to our ally. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2038.54s)]
*  We're next. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2040.3799999999999s)]
*  Lindsey Graham is like shitting in his diapers talking about, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2040.94s)]
*  you know, we might be next if the ICC comes after Israel. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2045.1s)]
*  And I think that that kind of stuff is, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2048.94s)]
*  I think a lot of people see it, you know, people that believed in these institutions, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2053.1s)]
*  not out of mere formality, but because they wanted to believe it, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2058.2999999999997s)]
*  they wanted to believe that these are like actual instruments of justice, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2063.8199999999997s)]
*  all of a sudden seeing the obviously hypocritical ways in which [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2066.46s)]
*  the American government and Western powers have used them. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2073.18s)]
*  Yeah, we actually had a debate two weeks ago. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2075.8199999999997s)]
*  This House would disband the UN Security Council, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2078.54s)]
*  which was, you know, sort of echoing a lot of the stuff that you just said there. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2081.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2084.2999999999997s)]
*  Whether actually- [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2084.94s)]
*  I think it should just kick America out. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2085.66s)]
*  We did that one as well the week before. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2088.54s)]
*  Yeah, the decline of America. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2090.86s)]
*  Yeah, I saw Merzheimer was advocating for that. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2092.86s)]
*  I think the dinner was crazy. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2095.66s)]
*  Yeah, he's so interesting. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2096.62s)]
*  Yeah, I heard he's like, he was debating all the way after, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2098.7799999999997s)]
*  even after the his, you know, debate time was over. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2101.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so in the bar afterwards, normally, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2104.7799999999997s)]
*  like people go and sort of the conversations continue. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2107.66s)]
*  And normally it's like, you know, sort of the younger professors [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2110.46s)]
*  and the younger politicians, he's quite old. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2112.54s)]
*  And he was there like all the way till closing time. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2114.62s)]
*  I was like, I can be like 18, 19 year old. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2117.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he loves he loves that shit. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2119.1s)]
*  He's an interesting guy. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2121.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and then Jeffrey Sachs before as well. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2122.46s)]
*  Yeah, also an interesting guy. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2124.46s)]
*  Especially his, I feel like if you only knew Jeffrey Sachs from like, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2127.2599999999998s)]
*  you know, the media hits that he does now, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2135.5s)]
*  you'd be shocked to find out what he was doing in the 90s. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2137.18s)]
*  You'd be like, what? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2140.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2143.1s)]
*  I'm just wondering, we're going to put two seconds, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2143.6s)]
*  we usually do like a 30 second clip with our speakers [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2144.96s)]
*  before they go on the Instagram story. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2147.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2149.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2150.64s)]
*  Yeah, wherever you're comfortable with. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2156.96s)]
*  So, it doesn't need to be anything long, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2160.56s)]
*  just about who you are, why you're maybe excited to be here [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2162.96s)]
*  and what you might be speaking about today. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2166.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2168.24s)]
*  So if I go three, two, one, and then you start. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2170.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay, right. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2173.04s)]
*  Three, two, one. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2174.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm Assam Piker. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2176.32s)]
*  I am an American political commentator on Twitch. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2177.52s)]
*  I'm here to speak at Cambridge Union about Israel-Palestine. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2181.04s)]
*  I'm very excited to hear what all the students have to say. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2184.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2188.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2195.92s)]
*  Good. All right. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2196.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2197.44s)]
*  Oh, you went viral with the- [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2201.36s)]
*  Oh my god. Elon Musk. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2210.2400000000002s)]
*  I hate him. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2215.28s)]
*  He's- you guys hear that he wants to give Nigel Farage 100 million dollars? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2217.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2224.88s)]
*  Yeah, but when you're a billionaire, you get to do whatever you want. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2226.02s)]
*  So we'll see. We'll see how illegal it is. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2228.5s)]
*  It's like, I like that we're treating the UK as, you know, as though it's a developing nation. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2230.1s)]
*  We're like, oh yeah, we're going to democratize the UK, whether you like it or not. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2236.1s)]
*  Bring some of that wonderful American spirit of enterprise and the free speech money. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2240.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2248.26s)]
*  Well, he is, yeah. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2252.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. He thinks he's looking at people for sort of thinking bad thoughts. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2255.78s)]
*  That's Elon Musk's perspective. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2259.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2260.42s)]
*  Which is quite threatening when it's the richest man in the world, actually. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2260.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2263.94s)]
*  He hates your country to that degree. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2264.44s)]
*  Well, he hates our country to that degree too. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2266.5s)]
*  So I think he's doing a lot of damage right now in America. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2269.1400000000003s)]
*  We'll see. We'll see how much- how he can branch out internationally with that. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2274.1s)]
*  All right. We have seven minutes. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2279.78s)]
*  Do you mind if we do a quick headshot for the YouTube thumbnails that we do? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2281.38s)]
*  No, of course. Let's do it. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2287.54s)]
*  Right here? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2293.86s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm not going to get you sitting in that chair. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2294.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2296.9s)]
*  Do you want me to do a YouTube thumbnail face? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2298.42s)]
*  Hit one of these like, oh. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2303.3s)]
*  Is it just my head or is it the whole thing? Should I sit like this? I don't know. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2311.38s)]
*  I feel like this is slutty. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2331.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2338.5s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2342.1800000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2352.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2357.3s)]
*  King, sit forward. They're going to call your head tiny. Oh, no. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2359.94s)]
*  That's true. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2362.6600000000003s)]
*  No, I messed up. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2364.1s)]
*  That's true. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2367.78s)]
*  I'm going to try to do a little bit of a [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2371.38s)]
*  general stuff like this. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2373.38s)]
*  It is kind of wild to just go to college in a castle. I can't get over that. That's crazy. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2378.02s)]
*  You know? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2385.86s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2388.58s)]
*  Of course. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2395.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2396.04s)]
*  Like professional or just chill? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2400.52s)]
*  Just chill. Yeah. I'm on the student committee as well. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2402.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2421.66s)]
*  The idea of 20,000 people watching this. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2428.7s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2434.7799999999997s)]

*  No, no, no. He does a little bit. You don't think so? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2511.74s)]
*  Maybe I'm being anti. I guess, like, technically, I mean, he's Welsh. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2515.42s)]
*  He's Welsh? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2519.3399999999997s)]

*  Yeah. Chad agrees with me. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2529.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2532.54s)]
*  No, he's a voice actor. He's great. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2534.06s)]
*  He does, like, video games and stuff like that. He's a Twitch streamer. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2538.22s)]
*  He, um, do you guys know, um, what's the, Chris, Chris Broad, Abroad in Japan? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2541.5s)]
*  Yeah. So he's one of Chris Broad's good friends. He's always in the videos. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2547.02s)]
*  He's the Welsh guy in the videos. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2551.26s)]
*  Yeah. It's the, Japan is amazing. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2556.86s)]

*  Hi, Chad. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2584.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm a little nervous. A little excited. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2590.2200000000003s)]
*  Uh, could you put this in the top? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2594.78s)]
*  I think I rely a little bit too much on my yap ability. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2595.82s)]
*  The gift of yap. The gift of gab. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2599.1s)]
*  But I think it'll be all right. Ultimately. I wrote this speech in the car over here. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2602.86s)]
*  In the car ride. It was a long car ride to be fair. Thank you very long. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2607.66s)]
*  So hopefully I won't be embarrassing Twitch and my community in the heads. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2612.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2617.98s)]
*  All good. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2619.18s)]
*  Chad, we're going to put in one of these. You've got a jacket pocket or something. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2619.68s)]
*  I don't know if you want to, in case you need to take the jacket off, it's too hot. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2627.68s)]
*  You know, if there's any risk of that. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2630.7999999999997s)]
*  I can, I can handle it. I can, I can deal with the microphone. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2632.3199999999997s)]
*  There we go. Uh, yeah, good. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2642.3199999999997s)]
*  So worst case I'll take the, the turtle neck off. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2644.96s)]
*  Yeah. And then put the jacket back on with a, with a tank that I have a tank up underneath. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2650.3999999999996s)]
*  It is hot. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2657.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2660.72s)]
*  No, it's going to be like five people in there. So I don't, I don't think it's going to be hot. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2663.6s)]
*  Everyone in Britain is cold except for the Cambridge union chamber. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2667.12s)]
*  Yeah. The spirit of debate. Yeah. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2670.08s)]
*  Keeps it hot. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2673.7599999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2675.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm thinking, do I pee? I don't really have to, but I feel like it's going to be a gamble if I don't. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2676.48s)]
*  Yeah. Oh no, I peed downstairs already. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2684.88s)]
*  Ronald Reagan peed here? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2687.76s)]
*  I didn't verify whether he peed at the time in the 1980s. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2690.16s)]
*  Oh wow. What a vile. Someone went in the drains and uh, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2697.36s)]
*  what a good, that's a great fact. That is a top, top Cambridge fact. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2701.68s)]

*  Yeah. That one is a more controversial, I think, that person they invited to the Oxford, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2749.6s)]
*  I have to see how much. Sorry. Cambridge Union. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2753.52s)]

*  just like you guys did. And then, and then what happened is as soon as I touched down in London, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2785.36s)]
*  they reached back out to my manager and were like, oh, you can't stream it by the way. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2792.4s)]
*  So like, yeah, I'm not going to do that. But we followed through. I don't think anyone's ever [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3QOl7mmRY&t=2796.1600000000003s)]
