# Exposes Ethan’s Dirty Lawsuit Trap | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc)
*  The vast annihilation of Zionist Zionism is a political ideology. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And I don't think I've ever said we must annihilate. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=7.2s)]
*  I'm not even going to finish that because he's going to clip this out of context and then use it in his next lawsuit probably. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=10.1s)]
*  But what a ridiculous lawsuit like. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=15.5s)]
*  But there's also some drama. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=23.8s)]
*  Apparently. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=29.0s)]
*  Apparently there is a second content that is I guess the hit the timelines and I make some interesting. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=31.2s)]
*  I'm in the content apparently. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=45.1s)]
*  But it's not a content alone. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=47.8s)]
*  It's also a lawsuit. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=49.3s)]
*  It turns out things initial content by his own estimation by his own statements was actually a trick was a trap. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=50.6s)]
*  He wanted to basically sue everyone that watches the content and he's you know, Mr. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=61.2s)]
*  Copyright infringement is is is trying to litigate the resentment that people feel towards him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=67.1s)]
*  Once again, which I think is very weird and he is trying to he's trying to he's launched a lawsuit against. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=74.39999999999999s)]
*  Frogan Denims and Casey Tron. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=86.1s)]
*  Now a lot of people watched his content. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  I don't know why he only sued those people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=91.6s)]
*  I mean, I watched his content as well as context. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=94.5s)]
*  But here's here's the I don't know. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=99.1s)]
*  This is so stupid. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=102.7s)]
*  I don't know what to say about it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=104.2s)]
*  But here's the certain ox thing I saw from it that I formulated an idea what if I could make a long form irresistible [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=105.5s)]
*  piece of content that I knew that these streamers couldn't resist they couldn't avoid the temptation of watching it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=114.0s)]
*  The second was published. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=120.9s)]
*  I don't have a issue with them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=122.5s)]
*  It's not that I wanted these people to steal my video is that I knew they would I knew they would watch the entire video [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=125.0s)]
*  at little to no calm instantly giving them no time to form an opinion. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=132.4s)]
*  The trap was set and it worked even. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=136.9s)]
*  Yeah, except I didn't do any of those things which I feel like is a major failure of a trap. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=138.8s)]
*  He begged me to watch it for months. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  He cried on camera that I just refused to watch it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=150.10000000000002s)]
*  And then I even told him I'd watch it alongside him if necessary. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=155.8s)]
*  Your prediction on this one even as a joke on the money as usual. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=160.1s)]
*  I even suspected that he might do some nonsensical bullshit like this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=163.2s)]
*  And then I ended up watching it months later to fundraise and it's a eight hour reaction for even half of the content. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=167.6s)]
*  So I guess that kind of failed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  So now he's just going after people who he perceives as defenseless smaller content creators that he can possibly litigate to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=178.1s)]
*  try to secure a litigation victory after he got a shit pushed in by a billionaire that he defamed Brian Kavanaugh. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=187.3s)]
*  And so now he's just like desperate to get a win somewhere. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't even know if this will work in his favor, but I don't even know if this was like a masterful gambit from the start. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=202.10000000000002s)]
*  Like I don't even know if this was like a setup because it doesn't make sense because on the one hand, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=210.0s)]
*  Why would you admit that you were doing entrapment? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=215.1s)]
*  Like you wanted people to go react to your video. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=217.4s)]
*  You said you wanted people to go react to your video. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=219.6s)]
*  You said anyone and everyone can even make money off of your videos in the past when we had a podcast together only to then turn around and be like, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=222.0s)]
*  actually, I got you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=233.0s)]
*  You reacted to my video and therefore you're done. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=234.8s)]
*  He claims you're watching. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=239.2s)]
*  It was fair use. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=240.1s)]
*  Unlike those he's suing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=240.8s)]
*  But yeah, I don't really I don't know. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=245.3s)]
*  I thought about I thought about not responding to this, but it's so silly that he was like he's openly admitting that he was baiting me into a lawsuit and then it didn't work. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=249.1s)]
*  So now he's just like going after other people that reacted to it as well. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=257.8s)]
*  He wanted everyone to watch it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=262.0s)]
*  He wanted more eyeballs to see this video. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=263.8s)]
*  He wanted as many eyeballs to see this video so much so that he like tanked his Twitch channel because he was playing in 24-7. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=266.8s)]
*  And now that more eyeballs actually saw it, he's upset better than I imagined it would. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=273.7s)]
*  We captured pretty much every large streamer reacting to it and it's entire you said you suspected this was his plan. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=279.3s)]
*  Oh my God, I just realized what Ethan's plan was all along. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=286.5s)]
*  I was suspecting that he was going to probably try to like hit me with a DMCA while I was watching it live. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=289.2s)]
*  So he could be like, haha, you over or something. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=296.2s)]
*  But it turns out he wants me to myself. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=298.4s)]
*  He wants me to endure some of the most bottom of the barrel washed in 2014 as commentary and editing so that if I go through a four-minute [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  segment of this, I will probably end up myself or just simply die as a matter of I'm not even like myself physically, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=313.8s)]
*  but just die from the pure horror. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=322.2s)]
*  Maybe both. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  Asani absolutely did not make this in mind. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=327.0s)]
*  He's just acting now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=328.8s)]
*  He thinks he's in a way that a villain would act. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=329.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of sad either way. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  It's sad to try and and like it's sad in so many different. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=335.1s)]
*  It's sad in so many different ways. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=341.6s)]
*  The reason why kids like then, okay, the content was actually bullshit. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  Like you don't actually think I'm off. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  You just slandered your Muslim former pockets calls of for for what this trap that you could launch against potentially him [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=349.7s)]
*  and all these other content creators who watch it like that was your brilliant plan. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=359.5s)]
*  Like this stuff was actually nothing cool, man. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=363.2s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=366.8s)]
*  The demands for deplatforming that are baked into the video very strange stuff. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=368.3s)]
*  But I guess the slander doesn't end there because in the Denim's lawsuit, I'm compared to the Grand Mufti Hajj Amin al-Husseini al-Husseini [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=373.1s)]
*  meets Adolf Hitler November 28th 1941 Al Husseini with his close friend. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=382.1s)]
*  In the wake of October 7th, Hassan emerged as the modern incarnation of the Grand Mufti Hajj Amin al-Husseini like Al Husseini [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=388.1s)]
*  Hassan became a passionate advocate and highly charismatic leader of the Palestinian cause like Al Husseini Hassan used his [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=396.3s)]
*  massive platform to spread rhetoric about anyone advocating for the right of Jewish self-determination in their ancestral homeland. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=402.6s)]
*  IE Zionists. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=408.5s)]
*  Hassan and Al Husseini is that Al Husseini worked with the Nazis and advocated for the annihilation of the Jews while Hassan advocates [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=411.0s)]
*  for the annihilation of all Zionists. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=418.6s)]
*  Since the vast majority of Jews in the United States say caring about Israel is essential or important. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=421.5s)]
*  This would necessarily include the vast majority of Jews even if they support the Palestinian cause and vehemently condemn the actions [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=426.3s)]
*  of the Israeli government. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=431.9s)]
*  The vast annihilation of Zionist Zionism is a political ideology. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=433.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=438.7s)]
*  And I don't think I've ever said we must annihilate. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=440.2s)]
*  I'm not even going to finish that because he's going to clip this out of context and then use it in his next lawsuit probably. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  But what a ridiculous lawsuit like he just had to do a little bit of he just had to add a little bit of defamation in there as [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=456.9s)]
*  Just sneak in some defamation for no reason like what the I agree with the bottom line is video when someone reacts to a video [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=457.2s)]
*  without any reaction shouldn't have him. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=462.5s)]
*  Maybe I'm insane. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=463.7s)]
*  No, but that's the reason why he's trying to use this as a as a form of attack so that people like you who have this opinion he [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=465.0s)]
*  knows that he can't litigate this issue on the basis of his support for Israel. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=473.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=477.4s)]
*  So now he's trying to litigate this issue on the basis of react content which is more in line with the normal kind of drama that he [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=478.2s)]
*  engages with and that a lot of onlookers such as yourself will go well, I kind of agree with that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=487.1s)]
*  He made this YouTube video. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=492.6s)]
*  He has every right to sue people for copyright. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=494.1s)]
*  That's it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  The only intelligent part about this is redirecting his his animosity to a better playing field as my goals reaction got millions of [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=498.20000000000005s)]
*  views and he barely said anything in the reaction. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=509.0s)]
*  Yeah, I suspect that as mingles reaction was I mean not as not as transformative but certainly complimentary which is precisely the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=511.8s)]
*  reason why he doesn't have an issue with that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  Interesting stuff. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=524.0s)]
*  Here is what I was talking about in and I think when we had the podcast together even back then. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=525.1s)]
*  I want to say a little show now. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=533.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=535.4s)]
*  Here's to all the industrial entrepreneur and spirits out there. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=536.9s)]
*  I am opening our IP to the world. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=541.6s)]
*  This is a message with peace and love. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=545.8s)]
*  You can now make your own h3 podcast. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=549.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=551.6999999999999s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=552.1s)]
*  I guess you know, that's not what I mean. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=552.7s)]
*  That's not what I mean. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=554.2s)]
*  No, you can't make a fake h3 pockets. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=555.0s)]
*  Although you probably could actually because I don't think anyone would mistake it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=557.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean if it's a parody, yeah, whatever you want anyone would mistake it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=560.5s)]
*  So our my hope our IP is open. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=563.9000000000001s)]
*  I got inspired by Hassan. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  He has that the Assam Industrial Complex. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=568.2s)]
*  I want the Ethan Industrial Complex. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=570.6s)]
*  I think it's a good idea. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=572.4000000000001s)]
*  I like it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=573.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's really cool and it's actually crazy how like many people are seemingly making a decent living. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=574.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean is a desperate attempt to grab on to fucking any sort of controversy and drama. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=580.9s)]
*  I'm sure that me reacting to it is actually playing into exactly what he wanted to do. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=585.1s)]
*  But the reason why I wanted to talk about this is specifically so that you guys go and show support to Denim's, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=589.3000000000001s)]
*  Frogan and KC Tron because obviously he has a fuck ton of money [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=595.6s)]
*  and he's going to use the fuck ton of money that he has to bully other content creators [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=601.0s)]
*  who don't have a fuck ton of money and try to win some kind of public opinion battle. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=605.6999999999999s)]
*  That is partially the reason why he went after Frogan, Denim's and KC Tron. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=612.6999999999999s)]
*  These are people who get insane lines of attack and most people don't choose to defend them. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=616.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't think he actually wanted to smoke which is precisely the reason why he didn't like try to do this for me [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=624.4s)]
*  or any other content creators who reacted to his context puke, which by the way was his wishes. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=629.0s)]
*  What that was his desire his desire from the start was for everyone and anyone to watch this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=636.5s)]
*  so that everyone could know about the dangers of me being a terrorist. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=643.0s)]
*  He said it in the context nuke on numerous occasions. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  Like I said, the reason why I'm mentioning this is because we should show support to the content creators. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=653.9s)]
*  He is unjustifiably attacking and that's it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=660.9s)]
*  That's it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=665.5s)]
*  That's all I got. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=666.3s)]
*  Yeah, malicious lawsuit is the name of the game. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=667.3s)]
*  It's so funny in this video. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=671.1s)]
*  He says XC and Asman he wants to be cool with and you actually had him have the whole debate where he did the worm. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=671.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he even Klein is very similar to Donald Trump in many ways. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=678.4s)]
*  Donald Trump will let bygones be bygones as long as you offer fealty or as long as he can use you. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=681.8s)]
*  Ethan sees as mingle the next you see as allies. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=689.0s)]
*  Ethan sees a bunch of neo-Nazis as reliable allies because they all fucking despise me. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=691.9s)]
*  And that's precisely the reason why he's perfectly fine with aligning with them and working with them [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=700.0s)]
*  because he operates on the the enemy of my enemy is my friend attitude. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=706.0999999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=709.9s)]
*  Pathetic. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=711.9s)]
*  Pathetic immoral desperate man. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=713.6999999999999s)]
*  A 40 year old still doing shit like this. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=717.0s)]
*  I think he's beyond upset that the nuke failed in every way. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=721.0999999999999s)]
*  The main goal is stopping us on infiltration of major media was a massive failure. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=723.0s)]
*  The goal to D platform and make smaller creators featured in the video lose viewers backfire tremendously. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=725.8s)]
*  Every small streamer that was featured has reached unprecedented levels of success after the video that too that probably pisses him off. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=730.3s)]
*  So I think he's trying to he's trying to throw money at the problem and frivolous lawsuits. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=736.4s)]
*  I don't know what the goal here is breaking react content in general after saving fair use. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=745.5s)]
*  Ethan Klein will now kill fair use one man's conquest one man's conquest to initially create a precedent that saves fair use that basically unfolded. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=752.3000000000001s)]
*  This this new era of content creation without fear of frivolous lawsuits turn is now going to what turn back into what is this? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=766.6s)]
*  Okay, stop showing me this fucking bullshit. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  Stop, please. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=778.7s)]
*  Can this be the last coverage? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=779.5s)]
*  Yes, it will absolutely be the last coverage. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=780.6s)]
*  The funniest part is all these clip farming accounts are cheering this on not understanding the they're the worst offenders. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=783.4s)]
*  Yeah, what happened with the Noah Samson lawsuit chicken out of that one didn't want to smoke exactly. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=788.6s)]
*  I just I personally don't understand how so many spineless fucking drama content creators are like throwing their hat in the ring. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=792.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's just drama. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=803.6999999999999s)]
*  These people three women are going to have their lives ruined because the entire ecosystem of streamers built their careers around their harassment and chowder's are getting fucking drama boners over exactly. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=804.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=812.8s)]
*  Anyway, that's all I got for today because I [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHxu9xF1Orc&t=813.5s)]
