# Breaks Down Military Numbers Iran Vs Israel | Hasan Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4)
*  And Iran has a lot of experience fighting. Iran has a lot of experience fighting ISIS [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=0.0s)]
*  and also numerous other troop formations in the region. We would rather not be tweeting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=6.46s)]
*  the same thing many times a day, but millions of Israelis keep running to shelter as Iran [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=18.84s)]
*  keeps shooting more ballistic missiles at Israel. Like I know this is for them to try [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=22.72s)]
*  and garner sympathy, but given how much everybody hates Israel, the only thing that this causes [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=29.84s)]
*  for many people is to look at that. And at most, like even the average person goes, Oh, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=38.28s)]
*  okay. Yeah. Sucks. I guess, you know what I mean? Like, and of course the, the other, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=43.84s)]
*  the other responses, people engaging in joyous celebration, but, but like, I don't think [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=53.4s)]
*  this is actually causing people to develop any, any sympathies for, for Israel at all. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=59.68s)]
*  Why would anybody like this is, dude, you have been doing, you have been doing to Gaza, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=67.4s)]
*  to the palace, to the Palestinian children for the past 20 months, they don't have this [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=75.2s)]
*  kind of alert system. They don't have shelters. I mean, even if they did, you would have destroyed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=81.4s)]
*  the shelters anyway, but it's so crazy. I think even people who don't hate Israel will say you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=85.64s)]
*  started in this case. I know. Yeah. This was my favorite tweet from the process. Iran has [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=90.28s)]
*  kidnapped an innocent civilian Israeli flying his fighter jet above Tehran just because he's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=95.52s)]
*  Jewish. This could have happened to any of us, you know, posting this sniping attack. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=99.72s)]
*  Hey, the pilot was an American woman, by the way. Wait, Oh, the pilot was a woman. No, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  no way. Is that a joke? That's a joke, right? Ain't no way they're both, they're antisemitic [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  and hate women. Oh my God. And America, antisemitic, anti-America, anti-women. That's crazy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. She's just a girl, dude. What the fellas we got to have ladies have some hobbies, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=131.36s)]
*  you know, sometimes the hobbies is doing for the ethnostate that also happened to find some time [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=136.88s)]
*  throughout their daily routine to go bomb a regional power with actual with an actual [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=144.32s)]
*  staining military and missile systems. That's just called being a girl boss. They didn't shoot down [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=150.64s)]
*  one jet. They're claiming they shot down three F-35 jets. One of the jets did have a pilot [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=155.92s)]
*  that seeming hit the parachute and they're saying that they captured the pilot. And now people are [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  saying that the pilot was a woman. I don't know the veracity of some of these claims. I do not [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=168.4s)]
*  support women's wrongs. Anyway, does Iran have the military capacity to go toe to toe with Israel, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=173.2s)]
*  assuming minimal US support or US support only in air defense? Does Iran have the capacity to go [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=178.16s)]
*  toe to toe with Israel without US support? Absolutely not three F-35s. It's one F-35, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=183.12s)]
*  one F-16 and one F-15. Okay. A D. I miss an ongoing denuclearization agreement. Sorry, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=188.72s)]
*  I'm posting a tweet. I'm going to ratio the Israeli occupying forces account. It's a wild [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=201.68s)]
*  thing. You can farm sympathy posting this from the occupying forces account currently sniping [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=207.6s)]
*  starving children does prefer a com of aid all because he chose to attack a regional power that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=211.2s)]
*  has missile systems. Amiss an ongoing denuclearization agreement. What is this? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=215.44s)]
*  Israel versus Iran by the numbers. Iran says that Israel's attacks on Friday, which have [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=220.0s)]
*  reportedly killed six nuclear signs, instructed in the tons, nuclear site underscored his need [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=224.4s)]
*  to pursue uranium enrichment and missile development programs. If you look at the military, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=227.84s)]
*  Israel has a total active personnel number of 169,500 with a reservist at 465,000. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=232.96s)]
*  Iran has active personnel at 610,000 with a 350,000 in reserve. Their defense budget is 10.3 [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=243.44000000000003s)]
*  billion. Israel's defense budget defense budget is 27.5 billion. Combat capable aircraft. Israel [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=251.68s)]
*  possesses several advanced us made F-35 stealth fighters, 340. Iran mostly operates older Russian [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=258.32s)]
*  Sukhoi and make fighter jets 312 plus 23 for the IRGC. Their air defense systems. Israel has iron [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  dome David sling and arrow systems. Iran has Bavar 373 S 300 and core dot horde dot systems. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=272.8s)]
*  Artillery Israel has 530 Iran has 6798. Israel is 46 helicopters. Iran is 34 plus [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel is five submarines. Iran has 19 submarines. Why do they have so few helicopters? What you mean [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=291.76s)]
*  Israel or Iran? Why does Iran have so few helicopters? I don't know. Maybe because [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=298.96s)]
*  they've been under a crippling sanctions regime in perpetuity. That probably has a big role in this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=304.56s)]
*  Also helicopters suck. Anyway, Iraq was stronger, but it didn't matter. You saw the Shogunate [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=312.48s)]
*  campaign. Iraq was stronger than modern day Iran. Are you insane? Do you know? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=317.36s)]
*  Do you understand like combat readiness? For example, Iran has been actively working in the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=323.28s)]
*  region for the past 20 years against ISIS. Iran has an insane military force. I believe it was. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  It wasn't ready. Us just too strong with air superiority. You're talking about also post war [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=341.52s)]
*  on terror. Iran bring us the new caliphate white boy. Maybe Iran 2016 would have been stronger [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=349.2s)]
*  right now. No, I'm sorry. Samba. Yes. Iraq was Iraq spent a lot of time building up his military. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=354.56s)]
*  I think the current, the, the current combat experience that the Iranian military has [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=359.28s)]
*  is not comparable to any other regional actor with the exception of maybe Turkey. Like that's the only [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=367.36s)]
*  other counterinsurgency ready standing military in the region. Like Israel's counterinsurgency [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=375.36s)]
*  revolves around children for, for Iran and for Turkey. Well, Turkey also, you know, sometimes [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=384.16s)]
*  you have children too. My mom must be real, but you know, Turkey is, is fighting Kurdish militias, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=391.04s)]
*  which they shouldn't be for the record. I'm not saying that that's a good thing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=397.92s)]
*  And Iran has a lot of experience fighting. Iran has a lot of experience fighting ISIS and also [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=402.08s)]
*  numerous other troop formations in the region. Sure. But we invaded a rock before you on countries [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  and there's no coalition of the willing here in modern day warfare is a lot more equal than combat [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=420.72s)]
*  was in 2003 with cheap drones. There's cheap drones, but it's not just cheap drones. War is, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=424.4s)]
*  is one and lost through attrition and logistics. Obviously if we're talking about like a full-tilt [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  invasion of Iran by the American military, like the American military will have a much harder time, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=439.84s)]
*  I think, invading Iran than it did destroying Iraq. But yeah, the, the obvious tech gap here [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=448.88s)]
*  is this chatter is correct. Israel has a massive tech gap in comparison to Iran, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=459.76s)]
*  a ginormous tech gap. Having said that Israel is, it would never be able to fight against Iran on [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=465.76s)]
*  its own. That is not even a question. Like, are you kidding me? Israel would not be able to fight [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=471.76s)]
*  Israel can't even on its own cleanse the Gaza strip without getting all of their 18 year old [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=477.12s)]
*  brigadier generals getting their shit smoked in the process of children. What are we talking about? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=486.16s)]
*  Look at Southern Lebanon. Israel has air superiority against the defenseless population of civilians. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=492.32s)]
*  And the only, the only areas where they can get, the only areas where they can get any sort of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  gains. The only place where they can make territorial gains is buildings built to the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=509.12s)]
*  brim with civilians. That's it. When it comes to ground combat, they get their shit smoked [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  every time their tech superiority, the tech gap that Israel has as opposed to Iran's like dusty [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=519.28s)]
*  ass equipment is, is significant. But I think in any sort of like direct one V one combat, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=525.2s)]
*  Israel gets their shit pushed in by most people. I mean, look at, okay, look at the, the tech versus [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  tech or tech gap. I wouldn't say that like Ukraine has the best gear, but they do have a lot of [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=540.48s)]
*  American weapons. They do have a lot of Western weapons. They do have a lot of Western tech. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=546.4000000000001s)]
*  Russia on the other hand has dusty ass equipment. It's not a direct comparison here because [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=550.88s)]
*  Russia has also air superiority over Ukraine, but they have still dusty ass equipment for the most [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=557.68s)]
*  part. But when you have more people in general, you end up overwhelming the smaller country. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  Like it does become a numbers game, especially when you're just basically pushing troops [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=573.52s)]
*  over and over again. It takes time. Russia doesn't have air superiority in Ukraine. Okay, fair. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=578.24s)]
*  That's true. You're right. Actually, I shouldn't have said that they do have, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=583.76s)]
*  I mean, they do still have coverage. They still bomb a shit ton of places in Ukraine to talk about. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  I was trying to explain that like regardless of the tech advantage that one side might have [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=595.04s)]
*  having numbers on your side and rushing is still unfortunately a fairly effective way of dealing [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  with things. Will Iran's response cripple the side trans DJ industry or is that a pipe dream? Who knows? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=610.16s)]
*  Why is Iran attacking civilians? Let me tell you why. It's because they're using human shields. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Israel's using human shields. It's really a direct violation of international human rights, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=626.48s)]
*  too. It's really about how Israel's [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZtsndota4&t=633.6s)]
