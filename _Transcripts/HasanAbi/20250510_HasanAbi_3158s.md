# India & Pakistan Agree To Ceasefire | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw)
*  Like my perspective on this matter is entirely around trying to restore some sense of normalcy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=0.0s)]
*  and global, global order to conflict. Okay. I'm not even making any claims on one side [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=6.36s)]
*  or the other. Like I'm not in, I'm not firmly on the Pakistani side nor the Indian one in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=12.64s)]
*  this issue. I'm simply looking at the situation and saying as an outsider, as an outside party [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=18.44s)]
*  going. All right. Let's start here. When is the men in show interview? Okay. Shut up. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=23.8s)]
*  Vorlo is not funny. Don't even start with me on this shit. Okay. Chatters. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=36.8s)]
*  The day started with a moment of intense jeopardy, two foes on the cusp of all out [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=41.48s)]
*  conflict and the sharpest escalation intentions yet. But it ended with the promise of a ceasefire [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=54.68s)]
*  announced by the U S president, Donald Trump on after a long night of talks mediated by the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=61.92s)]
*  United States. He said, I'm pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a full [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  and immediate ceasefire. Congratulations to both countries on using common sense and great [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=74.68s)]
*  intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter. He just came in and was like, all [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  right, enough, cut it out. Apparently it hasn't been working though. So I don't know about that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=88.12s)]
*  The world has watched on is two enemies spent days engaging in tip for tap damage inflicted [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=93.2s)]
*  on both sides of the border. But they've chosen to step back from a collision course that could [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=101.28s)]
*  have spiraled into a fourth wall. It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=108.16s)]
*  firing and military action on land and in the air and sea with effect from 1700 hours Indian [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=116.6s)]
*  Standard Time today. America is claiming a pivotal role in this truce. Whatever got these [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=125.8s)]
*  two neighbors here, it is the off ramp. So many were hoping for Mohammed Aslam has been here [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  before the 76 year olds has lived through two wars here on the border with India in Punjab [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=143.04s)]
*  province. I know where all the bunkers are, he tells me he used to carry weapons for the military [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=149.4s)]
*  before news of a peace deal broke. He was upbeat, but defiant. Do you think there's any way Pakistan [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  wins this moment? And if so, what does victory look like? I believe there won't be a war. But [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=165.64s)]
*  if there is Pakistan will win. Muslims never lose. We always win. We don't fight with power. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=171.48s)]
*  We fight with faith. The early morning missiles and chest thumping rhetoric had many here expecting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=179.68s)]
*  more was to come. Historically, this border town of Baddapur acted as a first line of defense for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Pakistan. India is just five kilometers away behind me. But the conflict looks different. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=193.64s)]
*  Being fought from the air, not the ground and India and Pakistan have walked into troubling [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=200.88s)]
*  new territory. It is territory they found a way out of. And for now, both are able to claim victory [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=207.24s)]
*  and project pride. But if they don't solve the issue of Kashmir, they could easily slip [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=217.08s)]
*  back to square one. Sky News, Baddapur, Pakistan. I'm from Pakistan. We made India go running to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=224.2s)]
*  USA in 12 hours. Oh man. I mean, you know, if we're, if we're, if the threat, if the threat is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  terrifying, at least we can have some funny memes along the way. You know what I mean? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  Pakistani missiles fired towards India. Soldiers cheer. But this has been in South [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=247.52s)]
*  Asia in decades. Pakistan released footage of its jets targeting it said Indian air bases [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  and retaliation for earlier Indian strikes on its territory. Bro, is Pakistan only achieved [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  a victory in this because Turkey was backing it. Okay. We are at the table. Just kidding. We are [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=275.88000000000005s)]
*  the table. Once again, as always Turkey is at the table. Turkey is the table. Turkey is all a Turkey [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=284.04s)]
*  is all of it. You understand important is India is still lying to yes. India is still lying as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. L also India knows Turkey's at the table. That's why they said we will nuke the table if [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=299.88s)]
*  need be. Modi got nothing against the podcast on [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=307.08s)]
*  no [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=359.64s)]
*  the slow motion cat acrobatics. Cat robotics is crazy. This is wild. I'm not following. Can you [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=369.24s)]
*  explain Pakistan? Get it? Like the cat's paw. What can't you understand? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=376.2s)]
*  Everybody back in the get the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=389.64s)]
*  Pakistan and Turk. Why else would they have a star in their name? Okay. But we also say [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=402.76s)]
*  Hindustan in Turkish. So India technically India technically also is a star in country [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  in Turkish in Jammu was the cat with the two lightsabers real? I think so. Yeah. No, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=417.08s)]
*  all of the all of the videos that we just watched were real. Like all of them every single one [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=422.68s)]
*  Indian administered Kashmir officials say five people were killed. There were deaths to side [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=427.32s)]
*  of the disputed territory. And this was an Indian targeting the Pakistani North Khan Air Base [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=434.36s)]
*  in Ralpindi last night. Today, both sides have been making claim and counterclaim [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=445.08s)]
*  about the level of damage they've managed to inflict on each other's military. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=451.72s)]
*  As residents on both sides of the border collected the remnants of drones and miles, officials [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=457.88s)]
*  signaled they were looking to deescalate with diplomatic efforts intensifying. President Trump [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=464.28s)]
*  was the first to announce a ceasefire followed by the Pakistani and Indian governments. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=471.24s)]
*  The Director General of Military Operations of Pakistan called the Director General of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=477.64s)]
*  Military Operations of India. It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=484.44s)]
*  and military action on land and in the air and sea with effect from 1700 hours Indian standard [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=494.2s)]
*  time today. The crisis followed a familiar pattern beginning with an attack by Indians [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=502.67999999999995s)]
*  in Indian administered Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan. Pakistan denied involvement. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=509.56s)]
*  Earlier this week, India launched a barrage of into Pakistan. It said targeting Pakistan says [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=515.8000000000001s)]
*  only civilians with what's different now is just how much further into each other's territory. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  Both sides are willing to strike with tensions so high. Can a ceasefire lead to wider dialogue? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=529.48s)]
*  It's been many years now since there's any kind of substantive talks between Pakistan and India. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=539.0s)]
*  Is this now a chance to pick that up? Well, I think this escalation definitely [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=543.96s)]
*  provides a light at the end of the tunnel and clearly there's been many issues that have been [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=548.6s)]
*  pending and unresolved for years and decades now. So we see it as an opportunity because it's a big [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=554.6s)]
*  win for Pakistan. Pakistan didn't flinch, didn't fold. On the streets of Islamabad this afternoon, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=560.52s)]
*  there were celebrations following the ceasefire announcement. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=567.48s)]
*  But Indians too are claiming victory and to have emerged with the upper hand. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=570.84s)]
*  These two countries emerged out of bludgeoned and genuine peace. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  This is so funny because like anytime anything happens, half of the chat is saying Pakistan [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=587.1600000000001s)]
*  violated the ceasefire. Look it up or India broke the ceasefire. Look at this. This is [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=593.08s)]
*  India broke the ceasefire just now. Look it up. It seems to me like you can't have a ceasefire [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=599.1600000000001s)]
*  if both sides are not interested in ceasing fire. All good? Yeah, no, I was ordering room service. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=605.96s)]
*  I'm hungry. There has been a possible violation of ceasefire today. India has claimed it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  Pakistan has denied it. India's press briefing has called for de-escalation in the bilateral [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=617.64s)]
*  talk schedule for 12th of May have not yet been called off yet. If the talks are called off, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=621.32s)]
*  we will have reason to worry. We're looking extremely shaky and fragile and the situation [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=625.72s)]
*  seems very fluid. When it comes to the missile attacks we were talking about in that report, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=632.6s)]
*  I think India will believe that they have sent a strong signal to Pakistan that any militant [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=637.1600000000001s)]
*  attacks in India will be treated, in Kashmir I should say, will be treated as effectively an [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  act of war and responded to in this very aggressive fashion. Pakistan will believe that they've [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=648.2s)]
*  established a strong deterrence to what it sees as unwarranted Indian aggression. I think one real [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=653.96s)]
*  danger is that even if this ceasefire holds a new baseline for the level of attacks the countries [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=661.08s)]
*  are willing to carry out against each other has now been set and that means that any leaders in a [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=666.6s)]
*  future flare-up would find it very difficult to do less than what we've already witnessed. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=672.12s)]
*  And with that backdrop, what prospect is there for dialogue between the two sides? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=677.4000000000001s)]
*  Well Cathy, you might remember at the beginning of this crisis, India suspended a key water sharing [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=684.36s)]
*  treaty. How is French food? Someone asked. Let me tell you, banger after banger. It's like, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=688.76s)]
*  it's unacceptably good. It's kind of fucked up how good it is. French food is disgustingly good, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=694.2s)]
*  straight up, messed up. Tea with Pakistan. According to Indian sources, that remains [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=701.5600000000001s)]
*  suspended. So potentially there could be some talks around that. It's certainly a crucial issue [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=708.44s)]
*  for Pakistan but an overall improvement in the relationship looks very tricky and one key thing [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=713.0s)]
*  to remember is that the leaders of both of these countries are hardliners. General Arsene Munir, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=718.52s)]
*  the army chief in Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India. Both of them see their [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=723.72s)]
*  neighbouring country as their own primary enemy. Just before we came on air, I spoke to Dr Mohammed [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=729.16s)]
*  Faisal, Pakistan's High Commissioner to the UK and began by asking with reports of attacks in [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=734.68s)]
*  Kashmir whether this ceasefire was dead on arrival. I'm not sure. I haven't verified the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=739.56s)]
*  information. There is some news coming in. I saw it on the social media just before coming into this [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=745.9599999999999s)]
*  interview. But I would definitely want us to wait before we have some authentic information on both [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=751.2399999999999s)]
*  sides because the ceasefire is quite precious and it has been arrived at after a lot of effort. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=758.52s)]
*  So we should not jump to any conclusion, my suggestion would be. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=763.8s)]
*  Would you condemn any militant attack in Kashmir? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=769.0799999999999s)]
*  It is a presumptuous question. If it happens, we can take it to them. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=772.92s)]
*  If it is a pure terrorist attack, we have always condemned it. Pakistan condemns terrorism in all [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=778.52s)]
*  its forms and manifestations and has done so for the last 30 years. Presumably you'd call on both [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=783.0799999999999s)]
*  sides to keep this ceasefire and for proper peace talks to take place. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=789.64s)]
*  Yes, yes. Pakistan wants it to continue and for peace talks to take place, to go to the bottom [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=794.28s)]
*  of the problem. Whether we like it or not, the bottom of the problem is not just terrorism. It [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=800.68s)]
*  is the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, which is there for 78 years and it has to be resolved as per the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=806.8399999999999s)]
*  UN Security Council resolutions, which India of course agreed to and Pakistan agreed to. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=812.1999999999999s)]
*  78 years have passed and a democratic solution in which you ask the people of Jammu and Kashmir [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=818.04s)]
*  is not happening. That is the root cause and if we address the root cause, the rest of the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  problem will automatically resolve. Let's talk about what prompted this latest round of violence [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=827.8s)]
*  between India and Pakistan and of course Pakistan denies involvement in last month's terrorist [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=833.48s)]
*  attacks. But would you accept that your country needs to do more to tackle terrorism in its midst? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=838.92s)]
*  Terrorism is a problem that has plagued the region. Pakistan is one of the biggest victims. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=844.92s)]
*  You would remember on 25th of March this year, a whole train was hijacked, which is stuff for [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=850.92s)]
*  novels and films and our forces had to fight and get it released. And I can quote hundreds of [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=856.92s)]
*  incidents including the Samjhauta express train which was attacked and there are serious allegations [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=863.0799999999999s)]
*  on India that they were involved in the train attack. So of course problems are there but we [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=868.5999999999999s)]
*  have to see it in a larger perspective. For Pehelganh, an international inquiry can look [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=873.56s)]
*  into it and ascertain the facts and we can move forward. Otherwise it's allegations, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=880.52s)]
*  counter allegations. How do we move forward? Well let me give you another example and that's Masood [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=885.7199999999999s)]
*  Azhar who's founder of Jaish Mohammed. Wasn't India entitled to attack a terrorist camp run by that [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=890.04s)]
*  group? You know India targeted a terrorist camp run by that group. They were entitled to do so, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=897.0s)]
*  weren't they? No, nobody's entitled to be judged. Would you let somebody target a camp in Britain? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=903.0s)]
*  No, nobody can. You can't be judge, jury and executioner. You have to verify it. There are [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=909.32s)]
*  police, there is a judicial system, there's an information first information report. Do you want [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=915.0s)]
*  countries to start doing that in Europe also? That if they feel that there is something and [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=920.92s)]
*  they're going to attack and by the way the Indians targeted three mosques. That is heavily [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=927.0s)]
*  disputed. Let me just pick you up on Jaish Mohammed. No, no, but this is important. Sorry, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=932.44s)]
*  this is important. This is important. They deny it, fine. Then let's have the international inquiry. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=937.96s)]
*  Why don't we, why are they shirking from the inquiry? If they are so sure that Pakistan is [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=943.5600000000001s)]
*  doing it, let an independent inquiry happen and let them verify. But I also wonder if you accept [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=950.0400000000001s)]
*  that you should do more to tackle people like Masood Azhar who you know when his, when the camp [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=955.8800000000001s)]
*  was attacked, he put out a statement saying 14 of his family member members were killed. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=961.16s)]
*  And he did not that this is all propaganda. There is no such statement. There is no such [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=965.9599999999999s)]
*  verification. Please do verify the facts. Also, that's his family members. It ain't him. That [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=970.52s)]
*  makes no sense. But even if they literally killed the dudes family members, like, okay, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=978.92s)]
*  like that makes no sense. That argument is so, stop chewing in my ears. I will not. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=984.04s)]
*  Now, before you move forward into it, there is a lot of propaganda coming out of India [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=988.2s)]
*  from both sides to be verified as I said, and there's a lot of misinformation from both sides. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=994.2s)]
*  We are open for an inquiry day before yesterday night. The Indians claim that they had captured [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1000.84s)]
*  Lahore. They have captured Karachi. Half of Pakistan is gone. My army chief has either [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1006.0400000000001s)]
*  resigned or prime minister has resigned or put under this is the propaganda. This is day before [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1011.24s)]
*  yesterday. Where is the propaganda coming out of Pakistan that the Indian prime minister has [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1015.96s)]
*  resigned? Okay, Dr. Mohammed Faisal, thank you very much for joining us. Thank you. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1020.0400000000001s)]
*  India has accused Pakistan of violating a ceasefire deal just hours after it was announced. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1025.56s)]
*  The internationally mediated agreement is meant to stop a dangerous escalation in fighting, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1031.16s)]
*  which has killed more than 60 people since Wednesday. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1036.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1039.56s)]
*  Explosions have been reported in several cities across India, did minister Kashmir. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1043.8s)]
*  India's foreign secretary has called on Pakistan to stop the violations and says [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1048.36s)]
*  Indian armed forces are responding. Pakistan hasn't yet commented. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1053.32s)]
*  There have been repeated violations of the understanding arrived at earlier this evening [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1058.84s)]
*  between the directors general of military operations of India and Pakistan. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1066.36s)]
*  This is a breach of the understanding arrived at earlier today. The armed forces are giving [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1072.84s)]
*  an adequate and appropriate response to these violations and we take very, very serious [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1080.28s)]
*  notice of these violations. We call upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address these [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1086.12s)]
*  violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1093.64s)]
*  Let's bring in Ommi Kulsoom Sharif. She is from New Delhi. It's not a good start to the ceasefire [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1101.3200000000002s)]
*  Kulsoom with the foreign secretary making that statement less than six hours after he announced [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1106.3600000000001s)]
*  a ceasefire. Well, absolutely. Those celebrations that we were talking about, people welcoming the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1111.4s)]
*  ceasefire have been pretty much very short-lived. Right after that sudden announcement by US President [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1121.72s)]
*  Donald Trump on social, saying that India and Pakistan have a ceasefire, also congratulating [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1128.52s)]
*  the two countries that they've been the step. We've heard of these explosions, particularly in [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1135.24s)]
*  Jumun and Trinidad. The chief minister, Umar Abdullah, just did a clip showing that there are [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1140.1200000000001s)]
*  explosions. What happened to the ceasefire? And now India's top diplomat has said the armed forces [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1146.28s)]
*  have been holding us from the drill and they've been asking us to respond appropriately to the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1152.6s)]
*  violations. Now, India is accusing Pakistan of causing these violations. Well, remember, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1158.76s)]
*  for the people in the border areas, tonight then is no different from what has happened in the past [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1165.8s)]
*  couple of months. And except that, there was supposed to be a ceasefire in place. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1173.16s)]
*  And Kulsoom, it's a very confusing picture. What reactions are you seeing from India to these [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1182.52s)]
*  developments? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1189.16s)]
*  Um, so, when we were out and we were speaking to people about how they respond to the ceasefire, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1189.8s)]
*  many of them were very happy and thought it was the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1204.44s)]
*  that actually got the ceasefire in place. There are some others who are not happy that India did [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1210.44s)]
*  not take strong enough action. And the others who said that finally, they should prevail and [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1216.52s)]
*  they're happy. The Pakistan traders were happy that it would be business as usual. People who [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1222.44s)]
*  for all these efforts that were, had been shot and they were hoping they would open up. So, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1229.4s)]
*  it's a sense of optimism, but also I think cautious optimism because people were wondering [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1237.32s)]
*  whether the ceasefire will hold. And across the region, when we look at, when we're talking about [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1243.48s)]
*  ceasefire, the first thing is celebration. And then people are have doubts whether the ceasefire [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1248.6s)]
*  will be able to hold. So, the official reaction is what we've got from India's top diplomats. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1256.04s)]
*  And we've also had to, Mr. Omar Abdullah, already saying that what happened to the ceasefire is us [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1261.56s)]
*  what it was supposed to be. That is Omicul sum, should he joining us on the phone from New Delhi? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1269.08s)]
*  Thank you very much. We're going to bring in Osama bin Javed. He's [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1275.24s)]
*  John. I love you, man. Why are you so one sided by the way, India's planning to BDS Turkey tourism. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1280.2s)]
*  There's been a major part of the condition in my room this morning. Tons of Indians coming into my [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1286.6s)]
*  chat saying Pakistan violated the ceasefire agreement. Joining us live from Indians. Don't [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1289.64s)]
*  forget. I'm, I'm in America. Please don't BDS me. Lahore. And I've seen over the last two hours or [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1295.08s)]
*  so conflicting reports on this from Pakistan. Osama, tell us what you're hearing. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1302.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, it is with, as we were just discussing a couple of hours ago, that this is a precarious [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1313.0s)]
*  ceasefire. This is a ceasefire on a line of control, which has been a flame for the last few days. So [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1317.8799999999999s)]
*  it will take time for it to take effect. And especially in the contested Kashmir region, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1324.36s)]
*  where the postures has been declared to be on a standoffish position by both of the militaries, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1331.32s)]
*  it will take time for them to climb down that ladder. So what we're seeing here is actually [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1337.6399999999999s)]
*  more or less the same, which is being reported by local sources in both sides. We've been speaking [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1343.1599999999999s)]
*  to our correspondent, Omar there, who's been reporting about what Indian side on the Indian [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1348.52s)]
*  side. Villagers are reporting that there has been a cross border shelling from the Pakistani side. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1353.32s)]
*  And here, we're exactly the same. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1357.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm losing my mind, bro. First, they cover what you literally call billions of Indians, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1367.56s)]
*  fascists in your latest video. How do you get to play victim or racism card? What, when did I do [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1373.72s)]
*  that? I was joking when I said Indians remember I'm an American, not Turkish. Don't be DS me. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1378.84s)]
*  I wasn't being sincere. And no, I didn't say billions of Indians are fascist. What the fuck? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1387.72s)]
*  I apologize. We have lost our connection with our correspondent Osama bin Javed in Lahore, Pakistan, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1394.6s)]
*  but just one bit of news from Pakistan. I believe we do have Osama Osama. Can you hear me? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1402.04s)]
*  Yes, I can. Yeah, Osama, I was just about to say that we are seeing it's being reported that [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1414.12s)]
*  Pakistan's information minister has told local media that as of now, there hasn't been any cease [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1419.32s)]
*  fire violations. The new drama bait talking points that you call India, fascist terrorist days. So [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1427.48s)]
*  now you think they're all terrorists. Okay. No, I didn't even say that. I said any state that without [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1432.92s)]
*  first of all, Modi is fascist. Okay. Modi is a fucking fascist. When did we all of a sudden [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1442.1200000000001s)]
*  forget that he's a fascist? Like how did that happen? Okay. This isn't to like defend the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1450.36s)]
*  Pakistan government at all. I'm not in the business of doing that. Why the fuck would I do that? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1457.16s)]
*  I feel like it's a pure expression of American interest in general, especially the Pakistani [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1462.68s)]
*  intelligence, which is, you know, a holdover for CIA in the region, many of which has contributed to [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1466.76s)]
*  terror in the region as a matter of fact. Now, having said that Modi is a fucking fascist, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1474.92s)]
*  like that 10 toes down. If you have issues with that, you can suck my dick. Okay. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1480.28s)]
*  I didn't say India is a fascist state. I said India is behaving like a rogue terrorist state. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1486.2s)]
*  And that is also correct because attacking another sovereign nation without evidence, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1492.1200000000001s)]
*  without like clear cut collaboration with said sovereign nation is ridiculous. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1498.68s)]
*  That's ridiculous. You can't do that. Like America is the only country that does that. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1504.28s)]
*  And Israel is the only country by extension of America that gets to do that. And they shouldn't [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1508.52s)]
*  do it either. And they are also rogue terrorist states for doing such things. You can't keep [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1512.92s)]
*  saying, no, it's not Pakistan started it, bro. Pakistan started it. Not, you can't say that this [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1517.8s)]
*  is fucking insane. Pakistan is the one who killed 26 innocent people. Am I missing something here? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1523.96s)]
*  Oh yes. What you're missing is evidence. Okay. What you're missing is direct evidence. And also [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1529.3200000000002s)]
*  what you're missing is restraint, evidence and restraint, evidence and restraint. Like there's [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1536.2s)]
*  never, I'm never post nine 11 in the United States of America. I mean, I was, I was not here yet, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1541.96s)]
*  but I would have called for the same exact restraint that I'm doing here. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1548.8400000000001s)]
*  If tomorrow there was a massive terror attack in the United States of America, I would call [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1552.8400000000001s)]
*  for restraint. I would call for an investigation and restraint. You want to know why? Because I [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1556.12s)]
*  have a moral position on this that is universal. You feel me? Some of you don't see it that way. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1561.6399999999999s)]
*  And it's all right. Okay. Well, I guess it's not all right. It's really fucked up that every country [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1567.6399999999999s)]
*  has now his own version of like, no, we got to do what we have to do. What the fuck is going on? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1572.9199999999998s)]
*  Like a day into the tit for tat bombing campaign cross border, after India had not only hit [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1578.1999999999998s)]
*  a into occupied Pakistani occupied customer territory, but they were hitting inside of [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1584.6000000000001s)]
*  Pakistan in general. It was crazy without any evidence whatsoever. And when asked like, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1593.0s)]
*  do you have any evidence that this was Pakistan caused like by the Polygam attack was born out [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1598.1200000000001s)]
*  of Pakistan. They were like, we don't need evidence. I've never seen anything like it. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1602.76s)]
*  That's the only, the only time I've heard that shit is from like America or Israel, you know, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1607.64s)]
*  what is going on? Every country is doing this. Now it's really fucked up. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1612.76s)]
*  Like my perspective on this matter is entirely around trying to restore some sense of normalcy [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1619.24s)]
*  and global, global order to conflict. Okay. I'm not even making any fucking claims on one side [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1625.64s)]
*  or the other. Like I'm not in, I'm not firmly on the Pakistani side nor the Indian one in this issue. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1631.8s)]
*  I'm simply looking at the situation and saying, as an outsider, there's an outside party going, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1638.12s)]
*  this is fucked up. It is pretty messed up that two nuclear armed States can just engage in heated [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1643.8s)]
*  battle with one another like this. This is incredible to me. I feel like we are living in [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1650.76s)]
*  the post nine 11 world, but we're also living in the post October seven world in a way where [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1657.56s)]
*  nation states are now just belligerent manner. We're living in a post Ukraine world too, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1663.08s)]
*  where like Russia just also as a foreign adversary showed the world like, yeah, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1667.8s)]
*  you don't got much motion, big bro. We do what we want to do. And you know, there's not really [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1672.76s)]
*  anything you could do about it. It's a little bit terrifying if I do say so myself, like America had [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1678.12s)]
*  an exit ramp. You're acting like an ignorant center. So now, no, I'm not. I'm not acting like [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1683.3999999999999s)]
*  an ignorant center is America had an exit ramp to basically say, no, no, no, we got to restore like [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1688.68s)]
*  the global communities, confidence and international rule-based orders. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1694.4399999999998s)]
*  And they just botched it with Israel. They were like, no, you could do whatever you want. What [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1698.12s)]
*  do you mean? You're our ally. So now get excited for more of these sorts of things happening all [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1702.6799999999998s)]
*  around the world. Very cool. That's exactly what we, we, we were just discussing that Pakistanis [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1708.4399999999998s)]
*  on this side of the border are saying that these border violations are happening by India and [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1719.08s)]
*  Indian villages on the other side are saying it's happening because of Pakistan. And what we need [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1723.8s)]
*  to understand is that because there's forward postures that these positions have been taken [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1727.8799999999999s)]
*  and there are areas, there are border posts on across the line of control where there is a [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1733.24s)]
*  conflicting claim of ownership now that Pakistanis are saying some posts, the Indians are saying they [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1738.44s)]
*  captured some posts and in the fog war, it is unclear. So according to some officials that we [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1744.68s)]
*  spoken to, they're telling us that it will take time and it will require patience on both sides. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1750.68s)]
*  So Pakistan is adamant that it is not violating the ceasefire agreement. It is abiding by it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1756.92s)]
*  There is a prime minister's address that is due to take place sometime soon. And we are hearing [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1763.0800000000002s)]
*  from security officials that they want this to be. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1769.0s)]
*  BDS on Turkey. Cause Turkish drones were found in Jammu and Kashmir on the Indian side. Yes, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1772.2s)]
*  I know. I know Turkey is the drone Kings. I know that also, what do you mean? They are literally [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1776.52s)]
*  the drone gods. They Turkey with the bio-actors like they've been, they've been sending them to [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1786.52s)]
*  Ukraine. Yeah. They are at the table. I'll take it one step further from what I understand. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1791.24s)]
*  I don't want continued shipping drones in the process. Like it's not like they, who knew DJI [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1796.28s)]
*  was Turk. No, no, no, no. You got Chinese drones for sure. But in terms of warfare, in terms of [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1803.08s)]
*  combat drones, like Turkey's got some pretty solid combat drones that are very affordable. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1808.6799999999998s)]
*  It's Chinese rockets and Turkish drones. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1812.6799999999998s)]
*  BDS collision. And if India carries out another aggression, they'll be ready to respond. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1815.1599999999999s)]
*  Osama bin Javed joining us with the latest live in Lahore. Thank you, Osama. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1823.1599999999999s)]
*  Let's bring in Mike Hanna. He's live for us in Washington, DC and Mike, I haven't seen any reaction [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1827.08s)]
*  to these latest developments from the U S are you hearing anything there? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1834.12s)]
*  No reaction as yet from any in the Trump administration. The president himself is out [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1841.1599999999999s)]
*  playing golf as he does on Saturdays and Sundays. We heard earlier the vice president JD Vance also [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1845.8s)]
*  putting out messages on social media congratulating the Trump team for achieving the ceasefire as he [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1852.84s)]
*  puts it. And in particular, the secretary of state Marco Rubio, who appears to be playing a major role [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1859.72s)]
*  in what the U S says are its ongoing mediation events. Interesting to note that Rubio in his [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1865.56s)]
*  social message earlier announcing the ceasefire said that he was going to get these leaders of [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1871.9599999999998s)]
*  the opposing sides together in longer term negotiation. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1878.36s)]
*  You melted my brain. I watched your India, Pakistan, Vaad, my family has extensive military [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1882.1999999999998s)]
*  background. You fucking reframe that diplomat interview for me. I started thinking I agree with [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1888.04s)]
*  this on and everything. Then why am I getting charged up now? Then the Rafael thing came up. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1891.0s)]
*  Then I remember the wire high risk type, which is very, very good journalism site getting blocked [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1895.24s)]
*  because of this. And now I'm in an existential crisis was I made a fool out of and BLA isn't [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1898.6799999999998s)]
*  talked at all in India. And when it, when it comes to Kashmir, both sides want customer, but no one [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1902.6s)]
*  wants the customers is really sad. Everything would be dialed up to 11 again. After this is so [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1907.4s)]
*  funny that we are literally the same people with the same bubble culture, destroying our countries. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1911.96s)]
*  And yet we're fighting each other. Thanks Brits, Jinnah and RSS, but I can still recognize the fact [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1915.88s)]
*  that no matter providing proof of solve anything, we did it like last time and Indians don't [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1922.0400000000002s)]
*  advocate for the child soldiers, the second line of defense in their parliament, but who knows what [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1926.2s)]
*  shit our state is up to, but am I wrong in saying that Pakistan is a U S dirty works client terrorist [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1929.96s)]
*  state? No, you're not wrong for saying that. They've said that also Dave said that the [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1935.8s)]
*  Pakistani defense minister literally went on sky news and was like, who do you think who's dirty [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1941.8s)]
*  work? Do you think we've been doing for the past fucking 30 years? Yeah, no, I understand that. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1946.36s)]
*  And I think like the fundamentalist elements eventually as nine 11 has shown, get out of [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1951.8s)]
*  control. They get out of hand. They have a tendency to, to, you know, take matters in their own fucking [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1958.12s)]
*  hands. But also having said that, like, you know, when it comes to the state level, when it comes to [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1963.48s)]
*  the, the, the way that states operate, like states have to demonstrate restraint, states have to [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1970.2s)]
*  behave in a restrained manner. It's fucking crazy. You can't, what are we doing? I don't know. I [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1976.3600000000001s)]
*  don't know what to say about it that I haven't repeated over and over again, over the over the [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1982.3600000000001s)]
*  past, over the past couple, a couple of days where everyone just yells at me, but I'm like, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1986.68s)]
*  dude, you can't just start bombing another country. Like what the fuck. And, and it's always wild when [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=1993.24s)]
*  it's always wild when the response is like, well, what was India supposed to do? Like they're [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2001.96s)]
*  fucking all terrorists, dude. They're all terrorists. It's like, well, not that, you know, like it's crazy [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2005.88s)]
*  just searching how many terrorist attacks have happened in India in connection to Pakistan in [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2012.1200000000001s)]
*  the past 30 years. And then tell me how we should have India reacted after the terror attack in [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2015.08s)]
*  Indian Kashmir. I already told you, okay. I already told you 1126 is, is a, a decent analog here [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2018.36s)]
*  for how India should have reacted. Okay. You can't also fucking constantly go, dude, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2028.28s)]
*  so many attacks of terror have happened and it's all Pakistan. And, and just be like, this one's [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2035.1599999999999s)]
*  definitely also directed by the state. Like there's a difference between, there is a difference [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2040.04s)]
*  between like militancy forming within your nation state boundaries versus directing said militancy [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2045.08s)]
*  to do an act of terror inside of, of Indian administered Indian controlled Indian occupied [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2053.0s)]
*  Kashmir territory or Kashmir territory that is receiving, you know, Hindu tourists. Like that's [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2059.96s)]
*  like the, these distinctions are important because unless you make this state connection, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2068.6s)]
*  you can't like, even after you make the state connection, you still can't fucking attack like [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2075.32s)]
*  this. Hold on. I got my phone. A neutral site. Now there hasn't been any further developments in that, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2079.32s)]
*  but clearly the U S whatever its role in all of this, contemplating a longer term negotiation [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2085.72s)]
*  process to attempt to look at the very root causes of this recurring conflict. But the events of the [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2092.52s)]
*  last hour or so, no reaction from the Trump administration at this particular point. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2100.2s)]
*  Mike, we will come back to you when we, if, and when we do have that reaction. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2106.2s)]

*  uh, and in this terrible time, me and you, we have been successful [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2379.56s)]
*  and the whole of our nation and all our provincial, provincial governments as well [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2387.2400000000002s)]
*  and all the departments and all the leaders of the departments. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2393.08s)]
*  Like before, we will all be working together and we will all be putting our, all our efforts, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2398.52s)]

*  me, I think more people should be embarrassed to stay, to say stuff like that. I just had a [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2437.56s)]
*  sit down interview with the most popular left politician in France for an hour and this [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2442.36s)]
*  motherfucker is in here talking to me about a dude who has cockroaches crawling out. Oh my God, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2449.56s)]
*  I got roasted by the fucking premier political commentator. Like you should probably be embarrassed, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2455.16s)]
*  to get your nose from a dude who has a rat, dead rat alarm clock, guy who recently fell out of his [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2460.84s)]
*  room, guy who recently fell out of his attic, doesn't like my political perspective. Oh no, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2466.2000000000003s)]
*  what will I do man? And that time is not far away when this will happen and we will all, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2471.96s)]
*  all together, we will work hard day and night and we will work hard to the extent [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2480.52s)]
*  that the whole world should be shocked when they see us and they are going to say [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2487.4s)]
*  that how Pakistan, and how the effort and the strength of Pakistan will make the whole world [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2494.12s)]
*  wonder that how courageous we are. Pakistan, long live Pakistan. Well, let's bring in now Ajay Shukla, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2503.7200000000003s)]
*  a writer at the Business Standard and a retired Indian Army Colonel. Good to have you on the [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2511.24s)]
*  program and to get your thoughts. Can we start with these explosions that have been heard? What are you [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2516.7599999999998s)]
*  hearing about that? Are you concerned that the ceasefire has broken down already? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2525.4799999999996s)]
*  No, I'm not concerned. I think that as the Pakistani Foreign Secretary just told you, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2530.8399999999997s)]
*  it's a very loose arrangement, the border over there. There's firing going on most of the year [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2538.36s)]
*  round and now that you have a ceasefire negotiated with the help of the Americans, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2545.2400000000002s)]
*  the firing is not going to die down all in one, you know, sort of sharp movement. It'll drag on [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2551.48s)]
*  for a few days, it'll reduce and if this ceasefire is to last, and I'm not saying that it will, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2559.32s)]
*  but if it is to last, it will, sort of the ceasefire will be implemented slowly by slowly [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2567.64s)]
*  and you'll find a slow return to normalcy and then business as usual. So that's the situation as of now. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2575.0s)]
*  Okay, that's positive at least. When it comes to the ceasefire itself, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2583.0s)]
*  why do you think both sides have agreed now? What do you think changed? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2589.56s)]
*  Well, both sides have their, you know, very strong domestic political imperatives that [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2593.08s)]
*  force the leaders to sort of take a harder line, take a sort of strong line of action, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2602.2s)]
*  especially when the other side and, you know, the Indian side doesn't differentiate too tightly [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2609.64s)]
*  with the Pakistani army and the Pakistani terrorists who the army sort of guides and trains [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2617.8s)]
*  and pushes into Kashmir. So with the, with the sort of these two elements. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2624.2000000000003s)]
*  This guy's giving me OSINT reporting on why a nuclear nation that didn't even use the OSINT [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2630.76s)]
*  reporting to justify fucking blowing up another nuclear nation. Thanks, ma'am. He's like, I analyze [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2637.32s)]
*  the bike tracks. India says they intercepted communication. Okay. Listen, Hassan, just listen. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2643.4s)]
*  And second point, you as an American, I have no idea what India has gone through because of [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2649.48s)]
*  Jihadi Pakistan. You were just cloud chasing. First of all, why the fuck wouldn't I just [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2652.44s)]
*  immediately go India lion too, sir. You're fucking killing it. India. Keep blowing up those Jihadi [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2657.4s)]
*  scumbags. If I wanted to cloud chase, like, why wouldn't I just say that so I can be an adored [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2663.96s)]
*  figure on Indian Twitter. It wasn't even a defensive Pakistan either. It's just a criticism of [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2669.16s)]
*  India's actions, but anything short of like full throw to support for India is seen as like a [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2674.8399999999997s)]
*  direct line of attack. Coming in sort of under the line of fire from the Indian side, there were [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2680.92s)]
*  air raids that were launched by the Indian air force with them coming under fire. There becomes [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2689.64s)]
*  evident and imperative to sort of negotiate a ceasefire, to sort of bring some of the pressure [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2696.76s)]
*  down. And that's what we're seeing right now. Well, of course, they deny that they're pushing [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2704.36s)]
*  the militants agenda, but they also have said that the 22nd of April attack was a false flag [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2710.2000000000003s)]
*  operation. What would you make of that? Quite apart from the sort of complete lack of sort of [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2716.44s)]
*  ethics that such a such a accusation sort of suggests, there is no reason at all for [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2726.92s)]
*  the Indian military or the even non-state actors to be guided by the Indian military to [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2736.92s)]
*  sort of to kill 26 tourists, all of whom the Indian side wants there because it suggests a [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2744.92s)]
*  return to normalcy. But why would they want to sort of do that whole sort of normalcy narrative? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2753.8s)]
*  So the idea is outrageous that the Indian side has sort of staged a false flag operation. And [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2761.7200000000003s)]
*  certainly India is having none of it. This was the worst sort of terrorist outrage in several years. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2771.4s)]
*  And you know, you can't expect a strong security oriented [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2780.92s)]
*  army to accept this kind of outrage without hitting back. And that's what you had. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2791.4s)]
*  Pakistan is saying that they've offered an independent investigation into exactly what [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2798.76s)]
*  happened on the 22nd of April by a third party, if necessary a neutral. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2803.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I got I'm casting GP3 baby. I'll be back in France. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2809.0s)]
*  Organization. But India don't want that. They've refused that. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2813.72s)]
*  There is really no need for India to sort of accept a third party negotiation. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2818.76s)]
*  Pakistan has since 1947 been trying to internationalize the Kashmir dispute to bring in [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2826.6s)]
*  sort of monitors and sort of soldiers of one kind or the other so that the whole [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2834.2s)]
*  dispute is cast into a sort of an internationalist merc. But India is not going to agree to that. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2844.12s)]
*  Quite apart from anything else, it runs counter to many decades of firmly entrenched policy. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2852.36s)]
*  And Pakistan has simply got no right to demand. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2860.1200000000003s)]
*  Nevermind, bro. That's what the good guys say famously. That's a crazy thing to say. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2865.32s)]
*  This is what I mean chatters like I'm sorry. This is like I'm not in the business of [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2871.4s)]
*  shitting on India. I know everyone's going to like I know that the internet is an incredibly [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2876.44s)]
*  hostile space for Indians in general. I have long talked about the unimaginable amount of hate the [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2881.6400000000003s)]
*  Indians face online. Okay. I've spoken out against it over and over again. But I'm sorry [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2888.52s)]
*  when you got people when you got actual government officials, but this guy's a former general, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2894.36s)]
*  but like or former Indian army colonel, but you have like actual current Indian government officials [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2898.7599999999998s)]
*  channeling this kind of fucking statement. Like it blows my mind. Not exactly giving me confidence [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2905.48s)]
*  as like, you know, being good guys on this, on this conflict. For those of you who are wondering, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2910.68s)]
*  what am I eating? I'm eating a French onion soup or as it unironically is called on this menu, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2915.72s)]
*  onion soup. I was people of Kashmir to decide for themselves then. What about this idea of a [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2921.8799999999997s)]
*  referendum? Well, the idea of a referendum as you sort of discussed with I think the [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2928.12s)]
*  park foreign secretary is that the UN already has a proposal for a referendum. The Kashmir dispute [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2934.9199999999996s)]
*  is supposed to be sort of resolved on the basis of this referendum, but the preconditions for the [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2943.96s)]
*  referendum. Why are you calling India as genocide country? This is the funniest thing, dude. It's [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2950.92s)]
*  like fourth hand account information from dudes who have no idea what the fuck I even said. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2957.56s)]
*  India is what if I said India is genocide country? What is going on? Where the fuck are you guys [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2962.76s)]
*  coming from, bro? I'm talking about Sri Lanka. Okay, that was a stupid question. I know where [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2967.96s)]
*  people are coming from that are saying that. I meant like, like where are you getting this [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2973.96s)]
*  information from? Bro, you are out of your fucking mind, dude. Jesus Christ. Calm down, dude. Calling [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2979.16s)]
*  India dirty and shit. Chill out. Something that Pakistan has come resolutely sort of debunked. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2985.56s)]
*  UNI commissioner told me that they would be prepared to withdraw their military before a [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2994.84s)]
*  referendum took place. Do you not believe them? The Pakistan army. Yeah, but the Pakistan military [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=2999.96s)]
*  said that they would be prepared to withdraw if there was going to be a referendum in Kashmir. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=3007.48s)]
*  They have never given any indication. In your video, you were talking about how white supremacist [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=3013.96s)]
*  countries don't treat India seriously. A country with over a billion people that is a growing [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=3018.44s)]
*  fascist movement and that movement intensifies and unifies one attack. Yeah, I did say that. And I [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=3021.32s)]
*  fucking cooked on it. I was right to say that. And I fucking cooked when I said that. And it's [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=3026.76s)]
*  genuinely terrifying. And I wish more on the ground of being willing to withdraw. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=3033.7200000000003s)]
*  India has given pointed this out several times in the past. In fact, whenever this issue comes up [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=3041.6400000000003s)]
*  for discussion, but Pakistan, while paying lip service to the concept of a referendum, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=3049.0s)]
*  does nothing at all on ground to make it so. Okay, well, let's keep our fingers crossed that [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCxuIYqAxw&t=3055.08s)]
