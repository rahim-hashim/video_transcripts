*  And then we can build around so if these are the shoes [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=596.24s)]
*  They don't have to be I'm telling you maybe I'm giving you too much options. Maybe you need some limitations [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=599.1999999999999s)]

*  Oversized, like satin looking brown shirt. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=2898.06s)]

*  Like it's light humidity [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5617.1s)]
*  This is a perfect day [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5619.1s)]
*  In comparison to how it was two days ago [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5621.1s)]
*  So it was like [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5623.1s)]

*  Wait, did you give it a rating? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5657.1s)]
*  Oh, if I were to rate this? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5659.1s)]
*  Yeah, scale 1 to 10 [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5661.1s)]
*  10 being the perfect drink [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5663.1s)]
*  This is like a 4 [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5665.1s)]
*  Like it's like a little [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5667.1s)]
*  Like I wouldn't casually sip on it [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5669.1s)]
*  I'm just drinking it because I have it in my hand [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5671.1s)]
*  This truly does feel like hitting a vape [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5673.1s)]
*  Like this tastes like a vape [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5675.1s)]
*  It also is probably just as like [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5677.1s)]

*  I think my man is in the lobby [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5703.1s)]
*  Have you ever had a bad interaction with a person while you're streaming? [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5711.1s)]

*  Never [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5717.1s)]
*  I don't think I've ever had a bad interaction with a person [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5719.1s)]
*  There's some people that are like a little [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5721.1s)]
*  Stick around too long? [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5723.1s)]
*  Yeah [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5725.1s)]
*  And there's definitely some people that are like a little [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5727.1s)]
*  Not very socially aware [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5729.1s)]
*  Oh [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5731.1s)]

*  But [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5739.1s)]
*  Overall, never a bad interaction [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5741.1s)]
*  Even like when someone tries to like [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5743.1s)]
*  Troll or be like [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5745.1s)]
*  Someone behave like a hater or whatever [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5747.1s)]
*  Which only happens in like conventions [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5749.1s)]
*  Like only happens like a couple handful of times [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5751.1s)]
*  Even then it's like so limited [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5753.1s)]
*  Oh I guess yeah [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5755.1s)]
*  Conventions, it's like a hot spot [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5757.1s)]
*  Well not even just like [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5759.1s)]
*  Like people will sometimes [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5761.1s)]
*  Approach me to say like [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5763.1s)]
*  Something stupid [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5765.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5767.1s)]
*  But again, it's like [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5769.1s)]
*  Like you can tell [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5771.1s)]
*  A motherfucker that's willing to do that [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5773.1s)]
*  Is already kind of [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5775.1s)]
*  They're not equipped for the outside world [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5777.1s)]
*  To begin with and you can kind of see it [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5779.1s)]
*  In real life when someone [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5781.1s)]
*  That normally would do that online [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5783.1s)]
*  Does it to you in person, it's like [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5785.1s)]
*  Like if we put a heart rate monitor on them [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr5er43Cw9E&t=5787.1s)]
