*  And frankly, there's plenty of look at all the media you have right now. There's plenty of coverage [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=727.38s)]
*  I was from a different age [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=731.6999999999999s)]

*  Network of its type [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=736.18s)]

*  We're well covered. Look at all the people that we have here today. We're well covered and we don't need it and it's a waste of money [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=749.86s)]
*  Especially I don't even know what doge's recommendation is. I assume their recommendation is to close them up. Well after they hear all the testimony [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=757.3s)]
*  I think they're going to make a decision relatively sooner than later [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=764.9s)]
*  But we'll see what that trade i can imagine. I can't imagine that they wouldn't because they have found so much waste fraud and abuse [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=768.74s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars and just waste fraud abuse. You heard yesterday some of the new things that were [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=777.38s)]

*  But 22 billion put into environmental accounts one was two billion into one account stacey abrams [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=790.34s)]
*  Where they had a hundred dollars in the account? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=797.06s)]
*  And just before I came in they put two billion dollars [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=799.9399999999999s)]
*  And you guys are looking so you mean two million or maybe two hundred thousand. No, two billion dollars were put in the account [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=803.78s)]
*  What do you think of that mike? Do you think that's a straight deal two billion? Just write me the check mr [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=811.06s)]

*  Just it's a horrible thing and we have we have so many of those things [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=818.26s)]
*  So they've done an incredible job and the country wants to hear it [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=821.38s)]
*  I think doge is actually very popular because of what's happening. They're hearing about all of these scams and and for big big money [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=825.5400000000001s)]
*  Tremendous amount when you add it up [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=832.96s)]
*  Uh just hundreds of billions of dollars being wasted and much of its fraud, you know [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=835.14s)]
*  We we talk about waste and it is waste and abuse but a lot of its fraud [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=841.14s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead brian [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=847.0600000000001s)]

*  Uh, and and maybe go after some criminal prosecution on that. Well, I think you're talking about a subject that is a heated subject [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=859.78s)]
*  And we'll look into it. We're going to look into everything but that's a certainly a subject [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=867.5400000000001s)]
*  That's been debated for a long time and we will look into it. Yeah, mr [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=872.1800000000001s)]

*  Some of the doge cuts into law. Where does the white house stand on that? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=882.82s)]
*  And are you making progress in which package? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=885.7s)]
*  Package to codify some of the doge cuts into law. You know what? It'll be great [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=888.34s)]
*  I think we're going to do that. I think they're going to do it. I think we're also going to be [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=893.0600000000001s)]
*  Codifying a lot of the executive orders that we've done which have been very popular [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=896.88s)]
*  And we're looking at one I will tell you right now that I think perhaps will be controversial but not with the people [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=902.02s)]
*  and that sanctuary cities we're going to end sanctuary cities for [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=907.9399999999999s)]
*  some of these jurisdictions that [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=912.18s)]
*  Aren't cooperating with law enforcement [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=914.98s)]
*  They're guarding criminals. They're [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=918.02s)]
*  taking [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=920.58s)]
*  The rights away from the citizens of this state in their city and we're going to be ending sanctuary cities if we find it [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=921.6999999999999s)]
*  Necessary to do in certain major areas and we may just end the entire thing altogether [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=929.2s)]
*  Because it's just a way of protecting criminals and nobody else is benefited by that and for some reason democrats [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=935.22s)]
*  Want to keep and they want to shield criminals from being sent back to their countries or being sent to prison [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=942.1800000000001s)]

*  That man is a very good man right there that you criticize so spoken [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1209.08s)]
*  He's a very good man and he will uh [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1214.44s)]
*  Continue to do a good job [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1218.2s)]

*  Done a very very effective job and you're going to see it and it goes on by the way [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1226.04s)]
*  It's going to go [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1230.04s)]
*  More plans [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1232.2s)]
*  This time to a real job less instead of goldberg [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1237.8799999999999s)]
*  Who's a major pussy? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1246.2s)]
*  They let the atlantic into that group shot with arms wide open [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1255.72s)]
*  Oh [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1259.34s)]
*  It's used by a lot of the military and [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1261.74s)]
*  I think successfully but sometimes somebody can get onto those things [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1265.02s)]
*  that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the uh, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1268.4599999999998s)]
*  Situation room with no phone zone, which is always the best frankly, but uh, you know [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1272.6s)]
*  You the best is to be there. In fact, oftentimes i'm here. Here it is [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1278.22s)]
*  In fact just last week I was in the situation room with something very important [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1282.3799999999999s)]
*  And we had a couple of people ex-brother-in-law. Sorry, I said cancel the line. Sorry fellas [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1286.46s)]
*  What you do is we'll tell you all about the meeting [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1291.5s)]
*  Can you make me [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1294.1399999999999s)]
*  Two perfect months we're bringing [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1306.46s)]
*  They started by saying it was the greatest first month [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1320.3s)]
*  That a president has ever had and I think that's true [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1323.58s)]
*  And now they say it's the best second month and they had a bunch broken. Yeah, I am I am broken [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1326.54s)]
*  Dude, what are we talking about? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1332.06s)]
*  What are we talking? Of course i'm broken dude [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1334.86s)]
*  the current the current administration is doing group chats on signal [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1337.4199999999998s)]
*  fantasizing about how they're going to bomb yemen and [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1343.8s)]
*  The group chat has a little bit the shittiest natsec reporter the the most like pro [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1347.58s)]
*  State department guy in the group chat, but like still the very fact that this happened is insane. Okay, I like it [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1353.98s)]
*  I would be incredibly hypocritical if I told you that this is a bad thing [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1361.4199999999998s)]
*  I this is a good thing [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1365.6599999999999s)]
*  I think they should do that but next time with a real journalist and not like goldberg who refuses to leak the the [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1366.46s)]
*  Classified information like you're a goddamn journalist. What are you talking about? They gave this to you [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1372.46s)]
*  This is your this is an incredible gift to you and you're just not going to do your job [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1377.1s)]
*  You're a bad person. You are the reason why people don't trust media. Okay non-contentious [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1381.98s)]
*  non-adversarial reporting is a genuine [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1388.12s)]
*  Is a [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1391.4199999999998s)]
*  Is this? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1392.6999999999998s)]
*  So annoying to me. Okay, it is so [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1393.82s)]
*  fucking [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1397.1799999999998s)]
*  Shitty it is quite literally the reason why mike waltz has green [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1398.62s)]
*  Uh, I was gonna say green like a goldberg's goldberg's a phone number [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1402.86s)]
*  Good like that man sitting right at the end of the table who's done a great job [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1407.5s)]
*  We shouldn't allow them to be hurt by it [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1411.58s)]
*  It could have defined his career as a journalist no his career as his career as a journalist is literally to defend the state department [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1416.54s)]
*  That's where i'm going to talk about that as well. Hold on number one [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1423.5s)]
*  We're gonna we're gonna get to that or app whatever you want to call it. If it's not classified then dump it [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1426.54s)]
*  Leak the name of the cia asset [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1432.1399999999999s)]
*  dude, if if the cia asset that they were talking about is like [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1434.6999999999998s)]
*  Is actually who we think it is maybe someone who is suspiciously at uh, you know in yemen right now talking to high profile [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1438.7s)]
*  Uh, houthi leaders, I would lose my fucking mind. Okay. Oh my god [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1447.58s)]
*  Oh my god [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1454.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh my god [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1456.78s)]
*  Anything like that [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1459.1s)]
*  Uh, I would I would ask them. It's not really an fbi thing. It's really something having to do [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1460.62s)]
*  It's probably not the case, but i'm just saying like it's [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1465.5s)]
*  Will somebody be able to break in are people able to break into conversations? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1469.1s)]
*  and if that's true, we're gonna have to find some other form of [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1473.66s)]
*  Of device and I think that's something that we may have to do some people like signal very much [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1477.74s)]
*  Other people probably don't but we'll look into it. I think michael i've asked you to [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1483.42s)]
*  Immediately study that and find out if people are able to break into a system now in this case [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1488.6s)]
*  It wasn't that the this attack was going on and nobody found out anything and again the person that was on [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1495.1s)]
*  As I understand it. He left very early because he didn't find it very exciting [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1501.9s)]
*  But uh, I think it's something you should look into. Yes, sir. We are [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1505.82s)]
*  We have our technical experts looking at it. We have uh our legal teams looking at it [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1509.82s)]
*  And of course, uh, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1515.5s)]
*  Uh, no one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger and as you dog you literally did that you did [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1520.46s)]
*  Do that though? You did do that. You did do that. You did that [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1526.46s)]
*  The media wants to talk about everything else except for the hostages you're getting out of the middle [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1529.4199999999998s)]
*  You did do that on on its back. It's not even a league [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1533.6599999999999s)]
*  It's not even a league technically because you guys did it [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1536.7s)]
*  As we just saw today with a black sea ceasefire. We were just on with [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1539.6599999999999s)]
*  Steve whitcoff myself our team in saudi arabia [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1544.3s)]
*  They want to talk about all this other stuff except for your amazing successes and the successes of your team [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1547.42s)]
*  Sometimes you have to move very quickly and the devices that are very good [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1554.78s)]
*  but they are very very cumbersome and you're not able to use them and uh from a practical standpoint, so [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1558.54s)]
*  We all we can do is find out the best we have with modern technology. They'll probably get better over the years [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1565.74s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead sir on the black sea [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1571.66s)]
*  So the kremlin has said that there were several conditions that would need to be met for this agreement to happen [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1573.42s)]
*  This includes sanction relief for banks and some companies did the u.s agree to all of those conditions that they laid out [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1578.54s)]
*  They will be looking at them and we're thinking about all of them right now. They're about five or six conditions [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1583.5800000000002s)]
*  We're looking at all of them [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1589.3400000000001s)]
*  That it's looking into how a journalist got added to that signal chat [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1594.94s)]
*  Is it possible that there could be a firing of even a lower mid-level official? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1598.0600000000002s)]
*  No, mike waltz did it himself. There's no firing [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1602.94s)]
*  We've pretty much looked into it. It's pretty simple to be honest. It's not [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1607.02s)]
*  Uh, it's just something that can happen it can happen [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1611.5s)]
*  You can even prepare for it it can happen [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1616.62s)]
*  Sometimes people are hooked in and you don't know they're hooked in they're hooked into your line and they don't even mean bad by it [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1619.5s)]
*  But it's not a perfect technology. There is no perfect technology. The really good ones are [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1625.58s)]
*  Very cumbersome very hard to [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1631.82s)]
*  Excess and I think uh, we're gonna look at we always want to use the best technology [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1634.54s)]
*  This was the best technology for the moment. But again, uh, it wasn't classified [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1640.3s)]
*  So they probably viewed it as being something that wasn't that important and it obviously [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1645.02s)]
*  With the attack being I mean, I don't know if it's been read out to you yet [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1650.06s)]
*  But that attack was a tremendous success for the u.s a tremendous success [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1654.6999999999998s)]
*  Was not classified do you think that might waltz made a mistake and doesn't need to apologize? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1660.86s)]
*  No, I don't think he should apologize. I think he's doing his best [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1667.1s)]
*  It's equipment and technology. That's not perfect [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1672.1399999999999s)]
*  And uh, probably he won't be using it again at least not in the very near future. What do you think? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1675.9799999999998s)]
*  That's true. I agree with you. Let's get everybody in the room [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1681.34s)]
*  Whenever whenever possible a lot of times you find out defects by [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1685.1799999999998s)]
*  Exactly things like that, but I don't think it's something we're looking forward to using again [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1689.74s)]
*  We may be forced to use it. You may be in a situation where you need [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1695.42s)]
*  speed as opposed to [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1699.8200000000002s)]
*  Gross safety and you may be forced to use it. But generally speaking, I think we probably won't be using it very much [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1701.5s)]
*  On that train the secretary of defense at phexed and jd barns vice president said that the europeans were freeloading [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1710.38s)]
*  Do you agree with others that's right? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1716.8600000000001s)]
*  uh [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2PhTtW-49M&t=1719.5800000000002s)]
