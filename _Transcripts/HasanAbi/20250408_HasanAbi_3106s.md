**HasanAbi:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A)
*  Decade order that I will sign in a few has you guys simply don't understand. Oh, he said 2035. Okay [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump has a vision that is future focused. That's why he's living in 2040. You're still living in 2025 [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=6.58s)]
*  Okay, that's the problem [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=13.66s)]
*  He thinks in centuries you think in decades. Okay the government bias [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=15.84s)]
*  Anyway Trump is live and he is doing an executive order to open speaking a hard man with hard [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=20.7s)]
*  Trump is opening up coblets [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=28.06s)]
*  Unleashing American energy. Let's take a look [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=32.06s)]
*  I liked Lee and knew Lee and he ended up winning the seat in a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=35.1s)]
*  Nobody knew what happened actually and then he was there for a long time. How many years we had been there? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  Eight eight years did was very popular and then he almost ran [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=46.9s)]
*  He almost won the governorship of New York, which is very missed lost by a few points [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=52.9s)]
*  Which was an amazing run and I said we got to get you in with us in some form and we did [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=56.900000000000006s)]
*  then he's head of the environmental agency EPA and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  Doing a great job and I said if we have a nuclear power plant [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=66.9s)]
*  Lee can you get it approved in less than a month? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  He said he said I'll do it faster and by the way, he'll do a fast job, but he's gonna do also a great job [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  It's gonna be an important job. We don't even smile about it [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  But you know, I've been involved in the approval process for a long time having been in real estate [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=87.02000000000001s)]
*  And you go years and years and years for absolutely nothing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=92.02000000000001s)]
*  And even in those days, they used to say, you know, we're gonna do a great job [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=96.02000000000001s)]
*  And even in those days, they used to say, you know, this whole thing could have been approved in a week or two weeks or three weeks [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=100.14s)]
*  And it would have been just as good [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=106.14s)]
*  But they'd take you down the path and you'd spend years waiting and then sometimes you get rejected [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=108.14s)]
*  I wasn't rejected too much. I was the king of zoning. I got I did well, but it was such nonsense [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=113.14s)]
*  It was so terrible. The process was so terrible [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=118.14s)]
*  But this is the big leagues now and he's the head person in the whole country and I appreciate it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=122.14s)]
*  I appreciate it. I appreciate you doing it and already they're respecting you very greatly. So thank you very much Lee. Great job [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=127.26s)]

*  They don't have to worry about environmental heat [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2011.02s)]
*  They have to worry about nuclear heat [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2013.02s)]
*  And if we're smart, we're working on that right now with others having to do with Iran and some other countries [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2015.02s)]

*  Why do you say it's such a call? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2068.68s)]

*  Americans have a mythology around coal [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2074.88s)]

*  about what we wanted for our country. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2089.8599999999997s)]

*  I believe most don't understand the importance of that. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2114.18s)]
*  Coal is one of the major factors in energy independence [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2117.3s)]

*  a big part of the reason why like coal mining jobs have become less common is because coal mining is not as [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2739.82s)]
*  common year over year is not necessarily because of the environmental regulations, but it is directly a consequence of [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2746.82s)]

*  He's not talking about like giving them additional benefits or whatever. He just talks. He just means like, you know, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2776.82s)]
*  will open up new coal mining opportunities for the coal business owners, but it's not necessarily going to help explode the [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2784.82s)]
*  capabilities or the labor power of the coal miners. Okay. And it's the same exact, it is the same exact problem with [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2793.82s)]

*  Librarians are jobs. Government regulators working at the federal authorities are jobs. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2839.18s)]
*  They're firing those people. And also simultaneously undermining their collective bargaining agreements [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2844.8199999999997s)]
*  at the federal level as well. TSA is a job, right? The issue is not the lack of availability [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2850.74s)]
*  of jobs. The issue is that these jobs don't fucking pay. Well, Trump believes this stuff [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2858.3399999999997s)]

*  factories either, by the way, because like Americans will work anywhere. It's the same [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2885.8599999999997s)]

*  Okay. Seemingly, even though that is also in dispute, but why do the people defend fracking? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2897.2999999999997s)]
*  Because it's a decent paying wage job in an area where there was no jobs for 30 fucking years. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2903.3s)]
*  That's it. That's it. And it's heavily backed by subsidies by the federal government. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2910.1000000000004s)]
*  It's not like these guys in Western Pennsylvania are like, no, my epigenetic memories require me [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2917.94s)]
*  to work in a fucking fracking field. Okay. I have, this is my genetic predetermined destiny. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2923.38s)]
*  That's not the reason is because they associate that sector, that industry with decent wages. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2931.2200000000003s)]
*  If the government was heavily subsidizing renewable energies, like, you know, the Chinese [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2938.98s)]
*  century of prosperity. Okay. If we were doing the American Communist Party, the Communist Party of [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2944.7400000000002s)]
*  America style, central planning, and we focused our efforts entirely on renewable energies, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2953.62s)]
*  then those guys would be the number one dick riders and loyalists of solar. It's just entirely [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2961.94s)]
*  about, it is just entirely about what gives them an opportunity to make a living. That's why I get [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2968.2599999999998s)]
*  mad when people talk about like retraining initiatives not working. It's not even retraining. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2975.54s)]
*  It's just training. If you are from an area where there is no jobs because industry left as a [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2980.34s)]
*  consequence of NAFTA or as a consequence of just offshoring manufacturing, and you haven't had a [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2988.1800000000003s)]
*  good paying job for 20 fucking years in your neighborhood. And then all of a sudden this new [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2993.46s)]
*  thing comes around. Okay. And it's fracking. You're going to be Mr. Fracking and you're going to get [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=2999.06s)]
*  the training to do the fracking. It's not like you knew how to do fracking beforehand. It wasn't a [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3004.74s)]
*  skillset that was applicable. You got trained to do it. It's not retraining. It's just training. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3011.3799999999997s)]
*  The point here isn't to get these guys to learn to code and make them code surfs, even though that [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3018.02s)]
*  part already happened. Everybody learned to code and look at the coding sector. Now, fracking is [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3023.22s)]
*  not a jobs provider at all. Please. No, I'm just talking about the environment, the mythology [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3028.5s)]
*  surrounding fracking and where that comes from and why people think it's a way of life that [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3034.18s)]
*  cannot be taken away. Anyway, each month, Cohn brought Trump to the latest job openings and labor [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3043.06s)]
*  turnover survey called Jolt's conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He realized he was [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3048.3399999999997s)]
*  being an asshole by rubbing it in because each month was basically the same, but he didn't care. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3052.18s)]
*  Mr. President, can I show this to you? Cohn fanned out the pages of data in front of the [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3056.2599999999998s)]
*  president. See the biggest levers of jobs people leaving voluntarily was from manufacturing. I don't [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3059.8599999999997s)]
*  get it. Drumstick Cohn tried to explain. I can sit in a nice office with air conditioning and a [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3063.3s)]
*  desk and stand on my or stand on my feet eight hours a day. Which one would you do for the same pay [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3066.7400000000002s)]
*  of a 2000 degree blast furnace? People don't want to go into coal mines and get black lung [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3071.3s)]
*  for the same dollars or equal dollars. They're going to choose something else. Trump wasn't [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3074.98s)]
*  buying it several times. Cohn asked the president. Why do you have these views? I just do. Trump [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3078.5800000000004s)]
*  replied. I've had these views for 30 years. That doesn't mean they're right. Cohn said I've, I had [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3082.6600000000003s)]
*  the view for 15 years. I can play professional football. It doesn't mean I was right. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3087.7000000000003s)]
*  I live in Eastern Oregon. All the blue collar conservatives around here aren't all about [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3093.54s)]
*  fracking. They're all about wind power because those are the available jobs here. Exactly. Exactly. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_D9o-_cn7A&t=3096.82s)]
