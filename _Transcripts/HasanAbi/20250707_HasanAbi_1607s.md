*  one was a big one and it was deep and granite and it was obliterated it turned out the atomic energy [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=254.88s)]

*  in carrying the biggest bombs ever the biggest bombs that we've ever dropped on anybody when [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=280.72s)]
*  you think and we want to keep it not clear by the way but they did a phenomenal job it was an [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=288.56s)]
*  amazing job and I think that was I was talking to Bibi about it before that was [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=295.28s)]
*  the very beginning of the end it ended very quickly after that I don't want to say what it [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=300.08s)]
*  reminded me of but if you go back a long time ago it reminded people of a certain other event [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=304.64s)]
*  and is uh Harry Truman's picture is now in the lobby in a nice location in the lobby where it [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=311.11999999999995s)]

*  happened it was a whole different ball game another one another strike on Iran I hope we're [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=322.96s)]
*  not going to have to do that I can't imagine wanting to do that I can't imagine them wanting [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=334.56s)]

*  things are going along very well they just you know left each other and it was not a pleasant [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=374.4s)]
*  period of a few days who's a little longer than a few days but this was not a pleasant [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=380.56s)]
*  period of time and you know we were at the end 14 missiles were shot and every single missile [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=385.36s)]
*  was shot out of the air it was pretty amazing that was sort of the end and they told us they [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=393.36s)]
*  were coming and where they were and what time they were coming and they said if you'd like to have [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=397.12s)]
*  a different time we'll do that and that's respect when they do that I appreciated that they did that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=401.28s)]
*  there was no surprise we got the soldiers out of the base in qatar in this case but they knew [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=406.56s)]
*  they were coming 14 missiles were coming uh one o'clock they said would you like to make it later [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=413.12s)]
*  they said no let them come at one o'clock and at one o'clock everybody was uh as you know over [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=420.8s)]
*  5 000 people left the base and we had three gunners and three assistants and out of the 14 [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=426.32s)]
*  that was shot all 14 were knocked down and that was the end that was about it and we had a uh [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=433.6s)]
*  we had a rough time but sometimes you know sometimes you need the rough time in order to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=441.36s)]
*  get I think uh I think things are going to be really settled down a lot in the middle east and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  they respect us and they respect Israel they respect a lot of things that took place nobody's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  ever seen equipment like what we sent over to knock out those sites but when those sites were [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  knocked out it essentially that was that was the end do you think there could be a two-state [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=462.72s)]
*  solution that I don't know I'd ask me that question you have the greatest man in the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=468.32000000000005s)]
*  world to answer that age-old question two states go ahead you give him your honest answer [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  I think uh Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves but none of the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  powers to threaten us that means that certain powers like overall security will always remain [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=484.24s)]
*  in our hands now that is a fact and no one in Israel will agree to anything else because we [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=490.64s)]
*  don't commit we want life we cherish life for ourselves for our neighbors and I think we can [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=499.28s)]
*  work out a peace between us and the entire middle east with president trump's leadership [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=506.08s)]
*  and by working together I think we can establish a very very broad peace that will include all [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=513.84s)]
*  our neighbors [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=520.48s)]
*  it's really a good question because if you remember when it was done I sort of said what's the purpose [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=538.08s)]
*  of talking it's been knocked out and knocked out completely but they've requested a meeting and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=542.64s)]
*  I'm going to go to a meeting and if we can put something down on paper that will be fine it'll [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=548.32s)]
*  be good I think they've gained a lot of respect for us I think they've gained a lot of respect [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  for Israel also but they would like to meet and we're going to have a meeting Steve what is that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=559.2800000000001s)]

*  so we'll see what happens I think it'd be nice to memorialize it put it down but the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=571.12s)]
*  incredible result of that attack if you want to call it an attack I didn't think it was necessary [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  to have it in writing I think we spoke I mean that speaks much louder than writing but I can [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=582.72s)]
*  I can also understand why they'd want it and they've been very nice they've been very respectful [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=587.6800000000001s)]

*  success we're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and one of the things that is [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1016.4s)]
*  so exciting is the number of companies and car companies where they're building plants [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1022.96s)]
*  ai is the big thing we have over 15 trillion dollars announced already and it's been I mean [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1029.44s)]
*  really I would say it's been during the last last three months but we're here for a short [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1037.52s)]
*  period of time and some administration's never had anywhere near that number for a whole term [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1042.4s)]
*  probably for a whole two terms but we're up to over 15 trillion dollars coming into our country [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1048.8s)]
*  there's never been anything like it anywhere in the world there's never been an investment like [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1055.68s)]
*  that anywhere in the world we uh look I told this story and I just told it to bb backstage I was [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1060.32s)]

*  really three strong leaders smart guys they all told me the same thing and then that was reiterated [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1075.36s)]
*  at NATO just recently when we got back where they agreed to spend a trillion dollars a year by the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1080.96s)]
*  way which is about three times what they were spending but they all said the same thing we [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1086.32s)]
*  thought your country was dead horrible term right we thought the united states of america was dead [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1091.36s)]
*  and now you're presiding over the hottest country anywhere in the world we're the hottest country [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1098.8s)]

*  surprises are going to be bad surprises [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1129.76s)]
*  Well, I would say that the best man to answer that is the prime minister but I will tell you [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1131.76s)]
*  that in my view I hope it's over yeah I think Iran wants to meet I think they want to make peace [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  and I'm all for it now if that's not the case we are ready will they enable but I don't think [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1151.1200000000001s)]
*  we're going to have to be but I think bb would answer that question very well I think the [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1156.72s)]
*  partnership between Israel and the United States the partnership between president Trump and me [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1161.04s)]
*  produced a historic victory it's an incredible victory actually it brought the greatest [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1167.76s)]
*  capabilities of the United States that are matched with the great capabilities of Israel [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1174.08s)]
*  and the army of Israel pilots of Israel soldiers of Israel and the Mossad while this guy is doing [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1181.44s)]
*  this uh extraordinary very important dick riding session uh Israeli occupying force soldiers got [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1189.12s)]
*  potentially smoked according to reports from the ground in Gaza IDF chief of staff threatened to [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1195.6s)]
*  resign over the incident the nuclear doesn't the soldiers burn and mutilate in a complex multi-stage [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1201.6799999999998s)]
*  ambush and bait hanun they were planning to build 20 000 of these things and launch it in a country [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1207.12s)]
*  the size of new jersey no country could withstand that so what do you do when you have two things [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1213.04s)]
*  that are going to kill you you have to remove them with our combined effort we did but when [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1218.72s)]
*  you remove a tumor doesn't mean that it can't come back you have to constantly monitor [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1224.48s)]
*  the situation to make sure that there's no attempt to bring it back so we've had a great [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1229.68s)]
*  achievement that's part of the effort of consul five soldiers killed that we don't have to repeat this [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  is to monitor this carefully of course the president and I are talking about it our teams [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1242.3200000000002s)]
*  are talking about it but there's no question this is a historic victory and I think as was said here [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1246.56s)]
*  today this has already changed the face of the middle east but I think I think that there is [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1252.96s)]
*  an opportunity here to create a historic expansion of the Abraham Accords which were themselves an [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1259.12s)]
*  act of history that deserve a noble prize for the president but I think the opportunities are much [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1266.8799999999999s)]
*  bigger and I hope I'd like to believe that Iran would not test our fortitude [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1272.72s)]
*  because it would be a mistake it's better to go a different way yeah they're looking for it they're [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1280.32s)]
*  looking for a second green light to hit Iran again except it will it didn't go the way that [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1284.16s)]
*  they planned it to unless America gets involved it's not about a green light to strike Iran [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1290.8s)]
*  it's about whether or not America will join in and how much America has the capacity to join in [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1296.16s)]
*  are you comfortable with the pace of change with the security situation vis-a-vis Syria right now? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1302.72s)]
*  I think there's an opportunity to explore I think that I think that everyone understands that the [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1307.84s)]
*  situation has changed before that Iran was essentially running Syria okay directly through [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1316.08s)]
*  Hezbollah Hezbollah has been brought Hezbollah Hezbollah is out of the picture so I think this [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1322.24s)]
*  presents opportunities for stability for security and eventually for peace and I think that [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1328.88s)]
*  I think that's been opened up also by the fact that the president has opened up a channel so [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1337.92s)]
*  they have something there's a lot to lose by going back to conflict and there's a lot to gain by [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1344.96s)]
*  moving towards peace I think that opportunity has been opened by the president and by the [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1351.1200000000001s)]
*  changed security situation which we brought about with the collapse of the outside regime [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1357.04s)]
*  let's suppose there were would I answer yes no right that's my duty to ask [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1366.0s)]
*  right it's your duty to ask and my duty to ask you back so you know the at the request of a lot [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1370.56s)]
*  of countries in the surrounding area of the middle east including Bibi we will we took the sanctions [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1376.0s)]
*  off Syria and I met the new leader I was very impressed by him somebody said well he comes from [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1383.84s)]

*  but I was very impressed by him but we took the sanctions off because we want to give them a [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1395.52s)]
*  chance they would never have had a chance without the sanctions and one of the things we have with [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1399.76s)]
*  Iran is you know we have very they call biting they are very biting sanctions and I would love [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1404.48s)]
*  to be able to at the right time take those sanctions off give them a chance at rebuilding [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1411.04s)]
*  because I'd like to see Iran build itself back up in a peaceful manner and not going around saying [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1416.0s)]
*  death to America death to the USA debt to Israel as they were doing you know they were the bully of [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1421.12s)]
*  the middle east and now they're not the bully anymore but they were saying terrible things and [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1426.56s)]
*  would like to see them they have such potential you know they have the oil power and they have [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1431.04s)]

*  thing like this happen but I think that taking the sanctions off of Syria is going to give Syria a [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1448.72s)]
*  great shot at making it [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfxo1olMrI&t=1453.92s)]
