# US Confirms Direct Talks With Hamas Over Hostages In Gaza | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU)
*  because they're actively undermining what remains of Palestinian sovereignty in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=0.0s)]
*  occupied territory of occupied West bank, which is occupied by Israel illegally for the record. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  So what's interesting about this process is that it's not, it's seemingly not just about [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=12.64s)]
*  let's take a look at what he had to say. Shalom Hamas means hello and goodbye. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=23.12s)]
*  You can choose release all the hostages now, not later and immediately return all the dead bodies [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=28.32s)]
*  of the people you murdered, or it is over for you only sick and twisted people keep bodies and you [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=33.12s)]
*  are sick and twisted. I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job. Not a single Hamas [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=37.92s)]
*  member will be safe if you don't do as I say. I have just met with your former hostages whose [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=42.0s)]
*  lives you have destroyed. This is your last for the leadership. Now is the time to leave Gaza [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=46.16s)]
*  while you still have a chance also to the people of Gaza, a beautiful future awaits, but not if you [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=50.4s)]
*  hold hostages. If you do, you are dead. Make a smart decision, release the hostages now, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=55.12s)]
*  or there will be held to pay later. President Donald J Trump. He's talking tough [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=61.68s)]
*  like a, like a comic book villain. And this is of course happening while white house is confirming [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=75.2s)]
*  that there are talks with Hamas. The Trump administration's hostages envoy has engaged in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=85.12s)]
*  direct talks with Hamas and Doha cutter white house and Hamas sources confirm market. The first [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=92.48s)]
*  time the U S has negotiated with the group, it designates as a foreign organization discussion [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=97.44s)]
*  reportedly focused on release of the American captives and a pursuit of a broader ceasefire. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=102.16s)]
*  And a pursuit of a broader ceasefire. Okay. Now this also came down as a Axios exclusive [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=106.8s)]
*  from Barack ravied. Here's what took place. Max Blumenthal says, so is sensitive diplomatic moves [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=116.16s)]
*  to the press, which I, I think this is a fair assessment of the situation. The meetings between [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=122.56s)]
*  bowler and Hamas officials took place in Doha in recent weeks while the Trump administration [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=127.68s)]
*  consulted with Israel about the possibility of engaging with Hamas, Israel learned about the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=131.52s)]
*  aspects of the talks through other channels. One source said the sources spoke with Axios on the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=134.56s)]
*  condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the sensitive meetings. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=141.04s)]
*  So Trump and his admin sidestep Israel to directly talk to Hamas envoys, Israel found out about it [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=145.36s)]
*  and then literally turned around and leaked it to the press. And then, and we'll get to the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=153.6s)]
*  details in a second, but, but what ended up happening, what ended up happening in the process [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=159.44s)]
*  was Donald Trump coming out and saying unhinged as bullshit about Hamas. He has one speed only. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=166.4s)]
*  And it's just, he has one speed and one speed only, which is to constantly blame Hamas. Even [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=175.04s)]
*  when Israel is the one who is ruining the talks, Oh, the lover is crying. I am not crying. This is [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=181.12s)]
*  I mean, if you are, if you're calling me lover, I suspect that you probably think that, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, America is a good country, is a powerful country, blah, blah, blah. Right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=194.56s)]
*  And if that's your attitude, then how do you not see your glorious president of the great white [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=199.2s)]
*  hope getting absolutely cucked by Israel like this? Clearly there are, there is an interest [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=203.6s)]
*  from even the Trump administration to try to pack this stuff up to the best of their ability, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=210.96s)]
*  but they want to do it quietly. And Israel is doing Israel shit, which is voluntarily trying [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=217.12s)]
*  to nuke the nuke, any kind of a ceasefire negotiations by leaking these in these, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=224.08s)]
*  by leaking these backdoor conversations that are supposed to be kept private under different [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  circumstances. I think Donald Trump would be infinitely more angry at Israel doing such things [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=235.68s)]
*  than Zelensky. This is a million times more disrespectful than what Zelensky has done. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=241.92s)]
*  Zelensky has done nothing that was disrespectful if we're being real. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=249.12s)]
*  Okay. The dynamic is very different and everything that Trump has said about Zelensky and about [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=252.56s)]
*  Ukraine and everything that Trump has done about Zelensky and Ukraine is unironically what he [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=258.88s)]
*  should be doing about Israel, but he won't do it. He won't do it because he is a anyway, key details [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=262.96s)]
*  according to Al-Arabi Al Jadid, a leading source in Hamas confirmed exploratory talks with the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=270.16s)]
*  U.S. envoy, Adam Baylor, two weeks ago, primarily discussing the release of at least four Israeli [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=274.72s)]
*  American prisoners, all military personnel. The talks followed Trump's call for a gesture of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  goodwill in Hamas. Hamas's release of Israeli American captive, Sojoy Dekel-Chen, in the sixth [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  batch of the exchange deal. The Palestinian resistance group reportedly raised the possibility [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  of a comprehensive deal to end the conflict. The White House press secretary did not confirm or [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=294.16s)]
*  deny these reports. Additional sources, Axios Times of Israel suggested Baylor has led multiple [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=297.36s)]
*  meetings with Hamas in recent weeks, aiming to secure the release of both living and deceased [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=303.2s)]
*  American hostages in Gaza. The U.S. has reportedly consulted Israel on these negotiations, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  though some details were withheld, causing tension between the two countries, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=314.24s)]
*  Times of Israel and Axios reported on this. In the White House briefing, press secretary [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=317.68s)]
*  confirmed the administration's engagement with Hamas. She said Israel was consult Trump believes [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=322.24s)]
*  in dialogue and talking to people around the world in a good faith effort to do what's right [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=326.8s)]
*  for the American people. Wonderful stuff. I suppose those conversations didn't go well [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=331.04s)]
*  based on Trump's recent statement. I don't know if those conversations went well or not. I think, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=336.0s)]
*  I think that Trump's recent statement is not about the conversations going well. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=343.2s)]
*  It's about the fact that he's, he's trying to throw a flash bang into the conversation by [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=348.24s)]
*  coming out and saying some unhinged shit about Gaza, because otherwise people are going to pay [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  attention to the fact that Israel leaked this information to the press and that Trump is actively [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=365.12s)]
*  talking to the Palestinians. It's going to frustrate the likes I suspect of Miriam Maddelson and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=370.32s)]
*  whatnot. And Libs didn't stand for a kid with cancer. I love that. I love that you're saying [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=377.04s)]
*  this while we're quite literally talking about Donald Trump's inability to deal with a ceasefire. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  Fantastic. Yeah. I mean, liberals are, this is true, but the fact that they didn't stand [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=388.16s)]
*  for a kid with cancer is idiotic. This is an idiotic line of argument. I think he's posting [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=393.44s)]
*  the anti-Gaza shit to save face. That's what I think. Okay. Washington has tonight acknowledged [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  that it's been in direct contact with Hamas in recent weeks over American hostages held in Gaza. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=405.68s)]
*  Let's go straight to our correspondent in Jerusalem, Lucy Williamson. And Lucy, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=411.6s)]
*  the U S has a long standing policy of not engaging with groups that it lists as organizations. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  What do we know about these discussions? Yeah, that's right, Rita. I mean, this seems to be a [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=420.56s)]
*  striking change in U S policy until now. It was thought the U S only had indirect contact with [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=427.12s)]
*  Hamas through mediators like Qatar. But a few hours ago, the White House press secretary [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=433.36s)]
*  confirmed that the U S hostage envoy was involved in those negotiations, describing them as ongoing [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=438.16s)]
*  and said Israel had been consulted, though we've had very little response from the Israeli [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=444.72s)]
*  government. A senior Hamas official told the BBC there had been two direct meetings between Hamas [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=450.72s)]
*  and U S official as well as several communications in Qatar, focusing on the fate of five [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  Israeli American hostages who are being held in Gaza, one of whom is still believed to be alive. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=464.88s)]
*  It's not clear what the outcome of these talks have been, but a few minutes ago, the U S president, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=472.48s)]
*  Donald Trump, issued a fresh ultimatum on social media, calling it his last Hamas release. All the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=478.4s)]
*  hostages now and the dead bodies, he says, or it's over for you. We made mention. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=486.4s)]
*  What is this? Republican introduced a bill with a grotesque name, the pager act that would require [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=494.0s)]
*  Lebanon to become a U S vassal. If it wanted aid banning of Hezbollah and Amal ending relations [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=498.32s)]
*  with Iran, designated its own officials as terrorists and ending all prosecutions up [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=502.88s)]
*  of Americans. Wow. Cool. That's cool. Seems good. Seems normal. Mike Johnson was not arrested. His [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  chief of staff was for a DUI. Oh my God. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's silly. It's gross. It's grotesque, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=514.16s)]
*  but I think the reason why they're doing that is, is once again, to just be like, yeah, we're cruel. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=521.68s)]
*  What are you going to fucking do about it? It's not a real legislation. I don't think, but a U S [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=528.64s)]
*  and Israel reject Arab alternative to Donald Trump's Gaza plan of the peace plan in the middle East [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=534.48s)]
*  that the Arab leaders were discussing yesterday. They're seeking international support for their [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=539.44s)]
*  Gaza reconstruction plan. The plan comes with a 91 page glossary that proposes an enormous rebuilding [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=544.6400000000001s)]
*  operation with crucially the Palestinians remaining in place. It will be costly. The bill is estimated [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=551.2s)]
*  at over $50 billion. There are detailed proposals in there on how to clear all the rubble. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=557.44s)]
*  The Israelis and the Americans, though, have already dismissed it as unworkable. There's no [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=563.7600000000001s)]
*  plan, they say, for disarming Hamas. They've rejected the proposals to restore and revamp [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=567.76s)]
*  the Palestinian authority. The more immediate issue, of course, is where we go from here in [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=572.16s)]
*  terms of the ceasefire. Israel's still withholding all humanitarian aid for Gaza, and it's now [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=577.04s)]
*  resisting, it seems, the terms agreed for phase two of the agreement. So let's bring in Yolande Nel, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=583.04s)]
*  who is in Jerusalem. Good to see you, Yolande. The Israeli prime minister said this morning [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=588.4s)]
*  in conversation with his new army chief that he is determined to achieve victory. That doesn't [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=593.92s)]
*  sound like there's much appetite to engage with the Arab League. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=599.6s)]
*  Well, yes, so far what we've had from Israel in terms of a response to that unified Arab statement [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  about a Gaza reconstruction plan, really, it's saying that this is rooted in outdated perspectives, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=614.72s)]
*  that it ignores the realities on the ground, and Israel has been standing by President Trump's [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=623.84s)]
*  alternative plan, which envisages the two million residents of Gaza being moved away and a sort of [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=629.6s)]
*  beach destination being created there instead. What we had earlier when Mr Netanyahu was speaking, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=638.08s)]
*  it was at the handover ceremony for the new Israeli military chief of staff, the former Israeli [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=645.84s)]
*  military chief of staff, Hersey Halevi, attended his resignation earlier this year, really because [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=651.5200000000001s)]
*  of what the Israeli military itself has found to be its complete failure to prevent the events of [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  the 7th of October, those deadly Hamas-led attacks. And we had both Mr Netanyahu and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=664.64s)]
*  his new chief of staff for the military talking about the need to have a full victory over Hamas. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=672.08s)]
*  Obviously, at the root of all this is how to disarm Hamas and what sort of authority and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=679.52s)]
*  security to put in place, Yolande. There was discussion yesterday of this plan to send [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=684.88s)]
*  international peacekeepers under the UN Umbarella. Who would provide those troops, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=690.56s)]
*  and what sort of access would they be given in Gaza? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=696.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, that is something that the UN Security Council is being asked for as part of this plan, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  without sort of more details being provided. It's previously been suggested that there would be [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=707.8399999999999s)]
*  Arab troops that could go into Gaza and that you would then have a handover as swiftly as possible [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=713.52s)]
*  to a new Palestinian police force with both Egypt and Jordan involved in training up those [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=719.44s)]
*  police officers. But this security issue is really the big one that remains unanswered. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=726.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, Hamas was not referred to by name in the communiques that came out of that [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=733.84s)]
*  Cairo summit. Hamas, though, has welcomed the final statements that came out from this meeting [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=740.08s)]
*  of the Arab League. It has shown a willingness to cede power. The idea as part of this plan would be [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=747.52s)]
*  that you would have a temporary takeover of Gaza by a committee of independent experts that could [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=753.76s)]
*  oversee the reconstruction, the distribution of humanitarian aid, but ultimately there would be a [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=761.68s)]
*  takeover by a reformed Palestinian authority. Now, importantly here as well, Israel has ruled out [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=767.84s)]
*  any future role for the Palestinian authority, which of course at the moment governs parts [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=775.36s)]
*  of the occupied West Bank. When it comes to Hamas's position on its weapons. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=780.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird because they're actively undermining what remains of Palestinian sovereignty [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=785.76s)]
*  in the occupied territory of occupied West Bank, which is occupied by Israel illegally for the record. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=793.44s)]
*  So what's interesting about this process is that it's not, it's seemingly not just about Hamas, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=800.8s)]
*  much to consider here. Yeah. Comparing Gaza plans, Arab league versus Trump, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=806.4s)]
*  Arab leaks is $53 billion, five-year reconstruction, Palestinians remaining Gaza, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=812.64s)]
*  technocratic governance, eventual PA control, international funding and oversight. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=817.04s)]
*  Trump's vision is us takeover of Gaza removal and permanent resettlement of Palestinians to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=821.68s)]
*  neighboring countries, long-term us control and development, ethnic cleansing. Doesn't seem like [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=826.48s)]
*  it's a much of a plan really odd, odd state of affairs. What it has been saying is that it will [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=831.44s)]
*  not disarm until there is the creation of an independent Palestinian state. And that is very [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=837.6s)]
*  problematic for the Arab countries that want to see this reconstruction going ahead. It's very [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=843.12s)]
*  problematic when it comes to shoring up that the current ceasefire, which is looking so wobbly, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  at present. Yeah. Just very quickly, Yulan, Steve Wittkopf, the US envoy incoming later this week. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=856.32s)]
*  That's correct. And really, you know, all parties looking to him to see if he can achieve some kind [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=864.5600000000001s)]
*  of breakthrough. He has talked about coming here ready to get an extension of the current ceasefire, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=872.48s)]
*  which is what Israel is now really pushing for, saying it wants the return of the remaining, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=878.4000000000001s)]
*  what's believed to be 24 surviving hostages from Gaza in exchange for this continuing period of [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=884.96s)]
*  phase one. But we've got Hamas rejecting that saying it wants to move on. It wants a full end [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=893.76s)]
*  to the war, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Thank you very much for your participation. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=899.6s)]
*  Ted Cruz absolutely explodes on Democrats for deep and pervasive problem confronting anti-Semitism. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=905.36s)]
*  Honest question. Why do you wear the MAGA hat? I wasn't here for the inside joke. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=910.1600000000001s)]
*  It's to showcase the apolitical nature of my commentary. Obviously, anything outside of [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=914.64s)]
*  complete and utter conformity to the most reactionary position that you can conform to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=921.36s)]
*  is considered political in nature. So I am showcasing to all with eyes to see that I myself [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=926.96s)]
*  am an apolitical content creator, not a politician, not a political commentator whatsoever. I am simply [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=933.44s)]
*  a man who is demonstrating common sense, just a chill guy doing common sense all the time. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=940.88s)]
*  This is what peak common sense performance looks like. Eat your heart out libs. Very reasonable guy [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=948.4s)]
*  with very reasonable opinions. A based centrist pilled common sense kind of guy that hat makes [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=956.88s)]
*  you look smart. Law. See it's working. It's working. It's literally working. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=962.8s)]
*  I swear to God, I swear it's a happening. Your thoughts on boobs and video games, sir. I want [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=971.52s)]
*  the entire frame to be dedicated to boobies. Okay. If they lower the saw, if they make the size of [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=982.24s)]
*  the boobies even a little bit small. Oh my God. I will not. I will lose my shit. Okay. Hey, yeah. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=990.8s)]
*  I don't know what else to say about the Trump Gaza stuff beyond the fact that it's it's completely [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=997.04s)]
*  insane. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelJuua8RkU&t=1003.04s)]
