# President Trump Holds Press Conference With Japan PM | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s)
*  I respect immensely as a blast off new golden age of Japan, us relations. He's so scared [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=0.0s)]
*  by the way, I look forward to welcoming you to Japan. From what I understand, the Japanese [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=7.66s)]
*  politics is like Japanese politicians are absolutely terrified. They are so worried [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=13.92s)]
*  about Donald Trump, basically voting all, all different kinds of trade, which is understandable. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=21.72s)]
*  Here, conveyed my willingness to cooperate together to elevate today, doing a press conference [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=29.0s)]
*  right after I came back. He came back to trillion dollars. President Trump and myself also concurred [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=42.44s)]
*  the Japan US partnership to an even higher level through improving business environment [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=51.96s)]
*  and increasing bilateral investment in employment, strengthening each other's industries, leading [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=59.4s)]
*  the world in developing. Yeah, we flew together. Such as AI and leading edge semiconductors [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=66.36s)]
*  and strongly promoting efforts to harness the energy of the growing market. Is he going [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=72.64s)]
*  to give us trains? He's not going to give us anything. What do you mean? Is he going [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=79.94s)]
*  to give us trains? He has no power. He has no motion. He has no Jews. They are the junior [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=83.02s)]
*  partner in this coalition. I got a blast off United States, liquefied natural gas to Japan. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=91.02s)]
*  Bill Morrigar. Thank you for the 50 big ones. In foreign exchange, as in the first Trump [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=97.34s)]
*  administration, close discussions will continue between Japanese and the US finance ministers [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=103.3s)]
*  who are experts in this field. We also held candid discussions on challenges the Indo-Pacific [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  region is facing. We confirmed that we are resolved not to allow unilateral attempts [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=116.41999999999999s)]
*  to change the status quo by force or corrosion and to oppose such attempts in the East and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=121.38s)]
*  South China Seas in order to fully defend a free and open Indo-Pacific. Trump did a 10 [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=126.5s)]
*  minute rant about California high speed rail and said he would try to stop at ASAP. Bro [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=132.54s)]
*  does not like trains. Yeah. I got the yay crash out as well. Hold on. Freaky Friday. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=136.22s)]
*  Please continue to age. I conveyed my strong sense of urgency and determination directly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=143.22s)]
*  to president Trump and gained his renewed strong support for the immediate resolution [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=149.38s)]
*  of the abductions issue. While this was my first face to face meeting with president [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=154.78s)]
*  Trump, we were able to openly and frankly exchange views. Do we have a meeting turned [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=159.14s)]
*  out to be very productive and meaningful. As a result of today's meeting, which marked a new [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=166.1s)]
*  departure for the Japan US relations, we are issuing a Japan US joint leader statement. This [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=175.66s)]
*  document will serve as a compass for further cooperation between our two countries on the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=182.66s)]
*  basis of these deliverables. I just use the prime minister's, I look forward to working [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=188.78s)]
*  Trump with president glaze fit. I respect immensely as a blast off new golden age of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=192.46s)]
*  Japan US relations. He's so scared by the way, I look forward to welcoming you to Japan. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=198.22s)]
*  From what I understand, the Japanese politics is like Japanese politicians are absolutely [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=206.02s)]
*  terrified. They are so worried about Donald Trump basically loading all, all different [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=213.34s)]
*  kinds of trade, which is understandable. I think she'll be okay with it. Somehow I'm [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=221.82000000000002s)]
*  trying to defend you in Tik TOK comments right now. I don't know how you do this every day. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=232.62s)]
*  The truth is the greatest answer to all defamation. That was the question Trump was just asked. What [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  does Melania think about this? I love real Donald Trump as much as a straight man can love another man. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=253.78s)]
*  I saw this. We don't have very good security in our country. They get it very easily. What [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=260.26s)]
*  we're doing, if you look at what has just taken place with respect to some of the investments [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=264.94s)]
*  that have been made on another agency that people have been talking about for years, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=271.62s)]
*  but nobody did anything about it. It's absolutely dangerous, bad, very costly. Virtually every [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=275.5s)]
*  is a con job. There's nothing of value to anybody. And this is a kickback scheme going on, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=285.34s)]
*  which is having foreign leaders sit through Donald Trump's ramblings about how like foreign aid [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  organizations are actually doing a con because they're, you know, paying to make people more [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=298.5s)]
*  woke and gay or whatever Donald Trump thinks is happening is so funny. We're talking about [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=305.53999999999996s)]
*  trillions of dollars. It will be in the end trillions of dollars. Trump just misses the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=310.58s)]
*  goat. He misses Shinzo Abe. That's what it is. Perhaps illegally overall. And I'm very proud [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  of the job that this group of young people, generally young people, but very smart people [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=324.58s)]
*  they're doing. They're doing it at my insistence. It would be a lot easier not to do it, but we have [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=329.34s)]
*  take some of these things apart to find the corruption. We found tremendous corruption. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=336.1s)]
*  Oh, I see the same ones. I see Maxine Waters, a lowlife. I see, you know, all these people, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  they don't, they don't love our country. They don't love our country. We want great education. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=353.06s)]
*  So they rank 40 countries in education. We're ranked dead last, dead last. But the good news [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=357.94s)]
*  is we're number one in one category. You know what that is? Cost per pupil. We spend more per [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=365.06s)]
*  pupil than any other country in the world. You look at Norway, Denmark, Sweden, various countries [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=370.74s)]
*  all up in the world. China does very well in education. And then you look at us, we spend [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=377.38s)]
*  much more money than they do per pupil or any other way, but we spend much more money than they [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=383.38s)]
*  do. And yet we're ranked. There's another one that we're number one at Biden's last. We're number one [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=389.06s)]
*  at another thing. School shootings. We're number one at school shootings per pupil and in totality [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=393.86s)]
*  to choice, but beyond choice, long beyond choice. I want to see it go back to the States where [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=401.06s)]
*  okay, great States that do so well have no debt. They're operated brilliantly. They'll be as good [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=406.58s)]
*  as Norway or Denmark or Sweden or any of the other highly ranked countries. They'll be probably [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=411.86s)]
*  have 30. I figure 35 to 38 States will be right at the top and the rest will come along. They'll [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=417.38s)]
*  have to come along competitively. And by the way, we'll be spending a lot less money and we'll have [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=423.22s)]
*  great education. One of the Doge engineers was fired for some inappropriate posts. The vice president [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=427.78000000000003s)]
*  says bring him back. What do you say? Well, I don't know about the particular thing, but if the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=437.06s)]
*  vice president said that, did you say that I'm with the vice president? Thank you, Peter. Yeah, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=442.42s)]
*  go ahead, please. Yes. Red dress. How strong do you want Japan's military to be? And do you [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=447.94s)]
*  specifically hope that their increased military spending will deter China and North Korea? What [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=459.06s)]
*  did you talk about that? Well, I want our military to be the strongest. I also know not your military. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=465.22s)]
*  I'm spending so much money. She's asking about the Japanese military. Also, that's like a child. Who [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=471.86s)]
*  is that person from? What organization is that journalist from? Because that was a question that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=477.54s)]
*  was like a elementary student. I shake a couple of the pocket water. But strongest military, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=484.66s)]
*  by far. We have great people. What was that? Was that the influencer having gone through the gauntlet? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=495.06s)]
*  He went through a lot, but he got through and he's going to be a tremendous. She was like, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=501.7s)]
*  Hello, Mr. President. Don't you think it would be sick if Japan had a big military? And is it because [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=505.86s)]
*  you want are you want them to fight back against North Korea and China? It's like, yeah, that's the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=512.9s)]
*  entire principle for beefing up Japanese self defense. Okay, which is unconstitutional as we [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=518.26s)]
*  found as we investigated further with the JCP stream. America meeting with Japan after you come [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=524.34s)]
*  back, your influence is getting ridiculous, dude. This is Hiramoto from Nippon television. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=532.34s)]
*  My question to let me ask a two quick question. Sure. First, this is the first meeting between [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=538.82s)]
*  Mr. President and Prime Minister Ishiba. So what kind of impression do you have on him? And numbers [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=545.22s)]
*  to do you have an idea? What do you have on plan to impose tariff against Japan so far? Thank you. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=551.38s)]
*  I think that he is going to be a great prime minister. I think he's a very strong man. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=560.74s)]
*  Very, very strong. I have great respect for him. I've known him. Shinzo Abe thought the world of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=565.46s)]
*  him. And I think he's going to do a fantastic job as prime minister. Very strong person. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=570.26s)]
*  Uh, I wish he wasn't so strong. I wish he was a little bit weaker than that, but [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=577.62s)]
*  that's what I got. I have to get strong guys all the time. He's going to be a great [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=581.7s)]
*  prime minister. I also, uh, in terms of tariffs, I mean, we're going to have tariffs, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=585.7800000000001s)]
*  mostly reciprocal tariffs where we go. He loves Shinzo dude. Shinzo Abe. Monday or Tuesday, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=591.86s)]
*  have an announcement, probably a news conference. This one looks just like him. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=598.4200000000001s)]
*  Reciprocal tariffs where liberals say that's racist so much who are charges us so much. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=601.94s)]
*  And we do the same. So very reciprocal because I think that's the only fair way. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=607.7s)]
*  They brought a new one for me. Nobody's hurt. Hopefully they protect your six. It's the same [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=611.86s)]
*  thing. And I seem to be going in that line as opposed to a flat fee tariff. Okay. Yes, go [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=618.02s)]
*  please. Please go ahead. Why don't you go ahead? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=625.7s)]
*  This is Ota from Yomiuri Shinbu newspaper. I have a question for. So this is your very first [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=633.46s)]
*  summit meeting. What was your impression of president Trump? Were you able to build a good [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=641.0600000000001s)]
*  relationship of trust and confidence in Northeast Asia? There are many challenges [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=646.42s)]
*  China, North Korea and so forth. And with the president Trump, what did you appeal to him? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=651.9399999999999s)]
*  And what kind of understanding? Thank you for the 20 gifted subs. There is the acquisition of your [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=657.7s)]
*  steel, the buying of steel and there are expansion of import of LMG. What were the communication [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=664.98s)]
*  tears against Japan because he loves Shinzo. One trillion dollars of investment from Japan to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=671.7s)]
*  investment. What was his reaction? What about your communication on tariff front? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=677.54s)]
*  This is the first time that I met with president Trump in person. So this was the first time [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=684.66s)]
*  meeting face to face. But for many, many years I have watched him on television. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=692.8199999999999s)]
*  So it was quite exciting. I was so excited to see such a celebrity on television to see in person [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=700.5s)]
*  on television. He is frightening and he has a very strong personality. But when I met with him, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=708.98s)]
*  actually he was very sincere and very powerful and with strong will for the United States as for the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=720.74s)]
*  whole world. I was able to feel that this was the Shinzo method as well, which is like aggressively [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=732.4200000000001s)]
*  glazed Donald Trump and be one of the only like world leaders that will stand by his side and hope [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=739.7800000000001s)]
*  that he doesn't roll over your country. That both of our countries need to play our role. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=747.3s)]
*  So he's following the Shinzo method. Endeavors and responsibility as for the increase of our defense [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=754.5s)]
*  expenditures. It is not that we are told by the United States to do so. Japan on our own, on our [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=761.86s)]
*  own decision and on our own responsibility. We need to increase our defense expenditures. But of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=768.66s)]
*  course we need to communicate and consult with the United States. But the responsibility is with [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=776.02s)]
*  Japan and the decision is with Japan. Now on the tariffs that if it is mutually beneficial, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=781.86s)]
*  no tariffs need to be set. And as for Japan, as Mr. President has introduced to us, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=795.78s)]
*  an unpretty investment will be made from Japan to the United States and so many jobs will be created. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=809.06s)]
*  So one trillion dollars is the target. And this will be to the benefit of the United States, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=816.42s)]
*  but also to the benefit of Japan as well. Investment is mutually beneficial. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=824.42s)]
*  So be it what's happening. Are you lagging or is it me? Am I lagging? It is not acquisition. It is [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=831.6999999999999s)]
*  investment. So the Japanese technology will be provided and the better quality products will be [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=838.0999999999999s)]
*  manufactured in the United States and the US steel will make products which will contribute not only to the United States and Japan but also to the whole world. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=847.86s)]
*  It is not one-sided. It will be reciprocal. It will be mutually beneficial. And I believe we were able to share [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=859.54s)]
*  on this and that is the biggest result that I have seen today. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=868.26s)]
*  Thank you very much. Go ahead please. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=872.66s)]
*  They're doing it as an investment, no longer a purchase. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=890.42s)]
*  I didn't want it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=893.86s)]
*  RAND 940. Thank you for the 10 gifted. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=894.5799999999999s)]
*  And they're going to do a big investment subject to getting the deal. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=897.22s)]
*  Thank you for the 20 gifted. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=901.14s)]
*  They're literally like, yo, we will invest so much. We will invest a lot of money [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=907.6999999999999s)]
*  into the country. Please, please don't roll over us with global trade. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=911.8599999999999s)]
*  Please, no matter what. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=917.78s)]
*  Well, we didn't discuss tariffs too much. We really discussed many other things including the [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=921.2199999999999s)]
*  pipeline in Alaska, which I think is going to be maybe the most exciting thing with Doug [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=925.14s)]
*  Chris. We discussed that at length, the pipeline. I mean, it seemed to be of great interest to them. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=930.02s)]
*  Did I do some lobbying for Trump while I was out there? Yeah. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=936.9s)]
*  More oil and gas than in Saudi Arabia, just Alaska. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=939.46s)]
*  Chad, it's time to tell you the truth. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=943.38s)]
*  I'm actually a part of the USAID. I'm a USAID recipient. I've been working for Donald Trump. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=946.82s)]
*  I actually went to Japan for a on a national prosperity and friendship tour. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=953.8599999999999s)]
*  It's time to come clean. I went to Japan with one purpose, and that was to ensure our partners [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=962.5s)]
*  in trade that their security was of our utmost importance and that they will play a very [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=969.14s)]
*  significant role as the bulwark against Chinese communism. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=976.5s)]
*  I'm actually not only a liberal, but a liberal of the highest order, a fed. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=979.3s)]
*  The highest stage of liberalism is when you're a CIA member, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=995.86s)]
*  when you're a part of the State Department. And that's what I am. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=999.46s)]
*  It's a really unfortunate thing, but the current administration, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1001.86s)]
*  I'm sorry, the previous administration was not allowing the LNG to be exported to us. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1007.3000000000001s)]
*  I believe that President Trump on the day of his inauguration [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1013.46s)]
*  allowed us to resume this importing. I think this is something that is really wonderful for us. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1017.5400000000001s)]
*  And as the country of Japan, we are interested in importing not just LNG, but also bioethanol, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1025.14s)]
*  ammonia, and other reasonable other resources at a stable. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1033.86s)]
*  Listen, the only people that work for the State Department or our federal agents, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1038.42s)]
*  or at least federal agent contractors that criticize Israel as much as I do, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1042.9s)]
*  are the ones who are overtly and openly anti-Semitic. Okay. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1048.98s)]
*  That's it. Those are the only voices that are allowed for some obvious reasons. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1054.5s)]
*  If you are not anti-Semitic, and as a matter of fact, aggressively against anti-Semitism, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1060.66s)]
*  and also simultaneously anti-Israel, you are the biggest threat. Because if you're an anti-Semite, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1065.94s)]
*  and you say fucked up shit about Jews, and then turn around and say you also hate Israel, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1072.02s)]
*  that's great. That's a great propaganda opportunity. You can go back and say, look, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1078.5s)]
*  these guys hate Israel because they're anti-Semitic. Okay. If you are on the other hand, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1084.02s)]
*  someone who routinely combats anti-Semitism and simultaneously from an empathetic point of view, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1089.78s)]
*  are in support of Palestinian emancipation, well, then you're a real threat. You're a real danger. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1096.6599999999999s)]
*  Right up in the front of the line. Yeah, go ahead. Please. Go ahead. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1108.02s)]
*  Thank you so much. Mr. Prime Minister, I have a question for you as well. But Mr. President, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1112.0200000000002s)]
*  I'll start with you. Quickly to follow up on what Peter was asking, have you directed Elon Musk to [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1115.22s)]
*  review Pentagon spending, given it's the biggest discretionary spending in the federal budget? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1120.18s)]
*  Yes, I have Pentagon education, just about everything. We're going to go through everything, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1123.46s)]
*  just as it was so bad with what we just went through with this horrible situation we just [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1128.8200000000002s)]
*  went through. And I guess 97 percent of the people have been dismissed. It was very, very [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1133.8600000000001s)]
*  unfortunate. You're not going to find anything like that, but you're going to find a lot. And [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1139.54s)]
*  I've instructed him to go check out education, to check out the Pentagon, which is the military. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1144.02s)]
*  And, you know, sadly, you'll find some things that are pretty bad. But I don't think proportionally [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1149.78s)]
*  you're going to see anything like we just saw. Your FBI has turned over a list to the Justice [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1154.18s)]
*  Department of the FBI agents who worked on the January 6 rioters cases. Are you planning to fire [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1159.1399999999999s)]
*  the FBI agents who worked on those investigations? No, but I'll fire some of them because some of [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1164.26s)]
*  them were corrupt. I have no doubt about that. I got to know a lot about that business, that world. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1169.46s)]
*  Rand 940 with another 10. We have some corrupt agents, and those people are gone, or they will [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1175.54s)]
*  be gone, and it'll be done quickly and very surgically. Did you have a question for the [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1180.82s)]
*  Prime Minister? Talk up. Are those the ones who worked on the January 6th investigation? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1188.42s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. I know we have some that are very corrupt and we don't like it. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1195.7s)]
*  We're going to bring back the reputation of the FBI. Cash Patel is going to do a great job, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1199.7s)]
*  and we're going to bring back the reputation of the FBI, which has been hurt very badly. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1205.3s)]
*  It's been devastated over the last four years. You have just been meeting for the first time [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1209.46s)]
*  with President Trump. The last administration famously did not have hardly any, if at all, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1217.14s)]
*  contact with North Korea. President Trump certainly did the last time he was in office. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1221.86s)]
*  Would you like to see him resume that contact and also that in-person meeting that he had with the [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1225.86s)]
*  North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un? That is something that the United States needs to determine on its [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1231.2199999999998s)]
*  own, and it's not something that we should request. Having said that, but [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1246.34s)]
*  for example, in Vietnam or Singapore, the President of the United States... [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1256.5s)]
*  Do you have to be a moronic idiot to be on Trump's cabinet? Yes. The dumber you are, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1262.66s)]
*  the better it is. But most importantly, you have to be a loyal idiot. Okay? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1268.26s)]
*  So now that I think being a smart loyalist is a problem because if you're a smart loyalist, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1273.78s)]
*  there are going to be instances where... [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRiXtLhXB5s&t=1282.02s)]
