# Day Two In France Defeated Me | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0)
*  All I've done today is basically live like a fat French lord, a pig, okay? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's all I've done. I woke up, I had Le Petit Degener, but it was not petit, okay? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=9.0s)]
*  It was not petit. Let me tell you, no petit at all. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=14.5s)]
*  It was very big, okay? Big breakfast. Fell asleep. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=18.0s)]
*  Woke up again. Big lunch. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=22.8s)]
*  Went to the Picasso Museum. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=25.2s)]
*  What's going on everybody? That's right, the f***ing noise gate is back. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=31.0s)]
*  Vive la France! What's happening everybody? I'm Assam Parker, the stars of the broadcast going to you live from... [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=36.0s)]
*  I guess it's sunny out here. Paris, France. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=43.0s)]
*  No longer occupied Vichy, France. Paris, France. That's right. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=47.0s)]
*  Oui, oui, oui, oui, oui. Oui, oui, oui, Sacre-Blau. We are live. We are live. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=51.0s)]
*  It is a... [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=57.0s)]
*  It is a... [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=60.0s)]
*  A French style... [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=63.0s)]
*  It is a French style stream. Oui, oui, oui. It is April. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=65.0s)]
*  Not April. Why do I keep saying April? It is Friday. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=70.0s)]
*  A Maze de Nantes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=73.0s)]
*  Nantes of the May. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=75.0s)]
*  I'm sipping on a very special type of French coffee. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=79.0s)]
*  A very special type of French coffee. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=83.0s)]
*  Which is a Keurig I think or something. I don't know. Is it Nescafe? Maybe? I don't know. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=86.0s)]
*  Oui, oui. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=93.0s)]
*  What? I just started. Like do you do this on purpose? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=95.0s)]
*  God damn it dude. It's crazy. Like I just... I can't believe it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=100.0s)]
*  They're right next to me. My whole f***ing family is on the same floor. So they're like extra annoying. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=106.0s)]
*  He's not even here. He left. Because I yelled at him. So he left. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=111.0s)]
*  I'm live. I'm alive. Ladies and gentlemen. I can't even hear my own audio. Okay. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=116.0s)]
*  I fixed it. I fixed this stupid freaking... I fixed this stupid thing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=121.0s)]
*  What jacket is that homie? If you had to guess to me what percentage of your chowders are furries, I don't know. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=127.0s)]
*  What's the cop the hoodie? How do? I will never tell you where I got the hoodie from ever again for the rest of my life. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=131.0s)]
*  For the rest of my life, I will tell you I will act like I've gate kept it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=139.0s)]
*  Because I'm sick and tired of telling you exactly where this hoodie is from. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=143.0s)]
*  Basically every single f***ing stream. I wear it pretty much every single stream. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=146.0s)]
*  And I cannot stand motherf**kers who keep asking, why are you gate keeping the hoodie? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=151.0s)]
*  Why are you gate keeping the hoodie? Why is it so much that you gate keep the hoodie? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=155.0s)]
*  Why are you such a piece of s***? Stop gate keeping the hoodie. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=159.0s)]
*  I don't want to have to constantly tell you where the hoodie is from. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=162.0s)]
*  Every single time I wear the hoodie, you're just not going to get it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=166.0s)]
*  Okay, little bro? You're not going to get it. You're just not going to get it, little bro. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=169.0s)]
*  Sorry, you will never get drip. And also, therefore, you will never get b***y. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=173.0s)]
*  There are chatters who are telling you exactly where the hoodie is from. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=178.0s)]
*  But I hope they actually lead you astray. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=181.0s)]
*  Here, this is a macaron. Look at how big this is. Okay? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=184.0s)]
*  I was going to tell you where this is from. But now I'm not even going to tell you where this is from. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=188.0s)]
*  Because f*** you, okay? F*** you! You don't need to know where everything comes from, okay? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=192.0s)]
*  Oh, man, I don't know where are the conflict minerals from your phone every goddamn day. F***! [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=198.0s)]
*  Oh, what a way to start the broadcast. Anyway, this is a French bakery. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=205.0s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you where it's from. Damn, that's pretty good. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=208.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. What's the flavor? I think it's supposed to be coffee. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=211.0s)]
*  They make pistachios ones? Yeah, I had some. They were very good. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=214.0s)]
*  Stuck, bro, I'm trying. Okay, stop trying. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=217.0s)]
*  This is the part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news about what's going on in the world of a son of a piger. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=221.0s)]
*  You guys probably know I'm mad because my whole life is f***ed up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=226.0s)]
*  Like I'm falling apart. I'm eating like s***. But I'm eating incredibly. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=230.0s)]
*  I'm not working out. I've been sleeping all day. And that's why I'm so tense. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=235.0s)]
*  What did I do in Paris today? Like last night I ended the broadcast at like 1.30 my time and couldn't, couldn't. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=239.0s)]
*  I could only sleep until like five and I woke up at five at seven. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=245.0s)]
*  The whole family jet lag. We went down to the buffet. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=251.0s)]
*  Little breakfast to get the breakfast. Okay. Very nice. Very cool. Very good. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=255.0s)]
*  I ate a lot on breakfast. I didn't drink my coffee on purpose so I could go back to sleep. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=261.0s)]
*  I ate a big breakfast. I was supposed to go to Notre Dame with the family. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=267.0s)]
*  I couldn't. Notre Dame. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=271.0s)]
*  You want to know why I couldn't? Because I was sleeping. I slept until 12. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=275.0s)]
*  And for lunch we went to a bistro. Another Le Bistro which was amazing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=279.0s)]
*  Apparently Dua Lipa went there last week. Not Malfry. But this bistro was incredible. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=286.0s)]
*  But it was poppin. There was like hella people out there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=296.0s)]
*  One Hassan Abiy head and his wife or girlfriend walked out of the building angrily eating my food. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=300.0s)]
*  And I think they couldn't figure out if it was me or not. But that was fine. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=306.0s)]
*  Bistro was great. After Le Bistro we went to, after Le Bistro we went to Le Picasso exhibit. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=316.0s)]
*  We went to Hitler art. My mom took us to the Picasso exhibit. That's not really Picasso at all. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=327.0s)]
*  This is the bakery here. I'll fucking show you. Piece of shit. I don't even know what this is. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=335.0s)]
*  I just know it's been around since like 1708 or something. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=341.0s)]
*  Yeah, the art exhibit isn't even about Picasso which is so funny. It's about degenerate art. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=345.0s)]
*  Jewish art, racial art, degenerate art. Like things that the Nazis considered degenerate art. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=352.0s)]
*  Surreal art for the most part. And the ones that they like banned and then turned around and sent some of these artists to concentration camps. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=360.0s)]
*  Killed them. It's stuff that I've actually talked about quite a bit on stream. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=372.0s)]
*  So I did think it was amazing because it was like very relevant to the modern parallel that I speak to on a regular basis. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=376.0s)]
*  I do wish they showed more Nazi art at the exhibition. Just to like juxtapose how awful it is. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=384.0s)]
*  They do show some, they don't have any of the direct Nazi art. But they have the, they have on the walls they have like footage, video footage of the parades that they did. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=391.0s)]
*  And the Nazi art that they tried to showcase as opposed to all of the super sick surreal Jewish art that they had made illegal. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=405.0s)]
*  And what's Hassan do? Do you really need to be careful what you say? That's definitely getting clipped. Yeah, I don't care. Whatever. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=418.0s)]
*  Yeah, the exhibit is Musée Picasso Paris Degenerate Art Modern Art on the, on trial under the Nazis. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=426.0s)]
*  Oui, oui, oui, oui, oui, oui. But yeah, this is what we went and saw. And it is very little to do with Picasso in general. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=434.0s)]
*  Like Picasso got, I think Picasso got, he caught us straight like once or twice and that's it. But it's the Picasso Museum, I guess. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=442.0s)]
*  So that's the reason why. Like it has nothing to do with Picasso. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=451.0s)]
*  And everything, everything to do with the, nothing to do with Picasso. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=455.0s)]
*  And everything to do with the, with the Vichy France and the Nazis. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=461.0s)]
*  What the hell? What the hell is this? Not good. The lights are off again. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=467.0s)]
*  Where should my girlfriend eat dinner? She's in Paris too. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=481.0s)]
*  What are you trying to get me to link up with your girlfriend? What the hell is this? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=491.0s)]
*  Why are you asking me, bro? Look at the boobs. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=495.0s)]
*  Anyway, it's all about like chat. I know, I know chat. I know. I know Rumeza Ozturk has been ordered to be freed from immigration. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=498.0s)]
*  I know we're going to cover it. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. You're not the first. You're not the first. You won't be the last. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=514.0s)]
*  You're not the first. You will not be the last. Let me talk about some degenerate art for like three seconds. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=520.0s)]
*  You uncultured swine. Okay. Let me talk about some gay ass art for a second. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=525.0s)]
*  Because the Germans were so stupid. Okay. I have a broader point that I want to make. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=531.0s)]
*  Well, some of you don't literally have to do the breaking news. I am breaking the news to you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=536.0s)]
*  Shit. Okay. Just to calm down, cool it, dial it back. You're at a 10. I need you to be at like a six. Okay. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=541.0s)]
*  Look at how chill I am. It's dark as hell in here and you don't see me freaking out. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=549.0s)]
*  No, the lights went out. Oh, bro. Take a break. Your vibes are today. I know I'm angry, but I'm actually fake angry. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=554.0s)]
*  I'm not really angry. I'm a little grumpy, but it's not super serious. Hey, how's it going to be? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=561.0s)]
*  Me and my wife in Paris. Any recommendations for a hotel in France with a good cook chair? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=568.0s)]
*  Yeah, this one. What I was going to say is why grumpy? There's a USA Today article. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=571.0s)]
*  Apparently I didn't even realize March took these photos. So that's cool. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=576.0s)]
*  This liberal influencer calls Democrats smug disinterested. He's right. Opinion. What the hell? What the hell? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=580.0s)]
*  What the hell? I don't know why they're calling me a liberal. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=586.0s)]
*  Yeah, we'll cover all this. Don't you worry about a dang thing. Okay. What's a similar place in Paris when I was 13? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=591.0s)]
*  I have a drawing of a swastika etched into my brain forever. Where can one see you to acquire a selfie? You can't. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=597.0s)]
*  I'm in the shadows. What proof Hassan is funded by billionaires. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=603.0s)]
*  Why did I click on this? Eat up your slop says their their rota frosh. Proof is on. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=608.0s)]
*  Parker is funded by billionaires accepting speakers fees, teaching businesses how to market to his audience. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=615.0s)]
*  Hassan lies about Sam Hyde. Worst debate ever. I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=622.0s)]
*  And I'm going to, I'm going to keep it a buck 50. Okay. This says 1,800 views. Okay. Okay. I'm serious. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=629.0s)]
*  If you watch something like this, I can't tell you what to do with your life because like what I, my suggestion to you, if you unironically consume content like this would be [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=639.0s)]
*  I can't tell you like, I can't tell you the mechanisms in which like what kind of medieval techniques you should be using to do the deed. Right. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=650.0s)]
*  Right. But like just, you know, this guy's the limit. Okay. Like that's it. It's just like you have already, you have already volunteered your life. You're like, I am nothing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=667.0s)]
*  I am not a human. I am something different. I can't speak on it because you know, no free speech out in this bitch. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=680.0s)]
*  Okay. And I mean like literally no free speech out in this bitch. Cause what is this Hassan cosplay? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=695.0s)]

*  and Nazi Germany in terms of how they also hate morally degenerate art. They talk about [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=1075.48s)]

*  some respect to the, the craftsmanship and the artists and the artists in general, even [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=1094.42s)]
*  if it was like a classical, a return to fashion, a classical mode of art, we don't even have [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=1099.42s)]
*  that anymore. We just want robots to do it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr5yn6FOqI0&t=1105.98s)]
