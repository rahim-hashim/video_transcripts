*  Alright. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=0.0s)]
*  Alright, the closer we get to the Palestinian demonstration, the crazy, the more hectic it's getting. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2.5s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=11.0s)]
*  Oh, we gotta keep walking, I'm sorry. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=13.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=16.0s)]
*  Alright, it's swapped. It's on you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=22.5s)]
*  It's on me? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=27.0s)]
*  It's on you guys! [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=28.5s)]
*  Is it on? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=30.0s)]
*  Is my mic on? Can you back the f*** up? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=31.5s)]
*  This again, I forgot. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=34.5s)]
*  Don't put the doors. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=36.0s)]
*  I'm a professional. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=38.0s)]
*  Alright, let's do it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=43.5s)]
*  Let's go, baby. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=44.5s)]
*  We're 20 floors below. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=50.0s)]
*  20 floors underground. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=53.5s)]
*  This place is scary. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=57.5s)]
*  Do you like banks? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=60.5s)]
*  Don't, he's sensitive. Don't make jokes. He's gonna say you're being anti-Semitic. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=63.5s)]
*  I heard you like banks. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=68.0s)]

*  So you can come back. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=82.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=192.5s)]
*  How far is the White House from here? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=194.5s)]
*  The walk there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=195.5s)]
*  17 minutes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=197.5s)]
*  Oh, so we're not stuck. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=198.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=200.0s)]
*  It's 17 minutes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=201.0s)]
*  And it's just straight down. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=202.0s)]
*  But the car was going to be faster, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=204.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=206.0s)]
*  That's not perfect. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=207.0s)]
*  Let's walk. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=208.0s)]
*  I mean, it's almost here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=210.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=211.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=212.0s)]
*  We made some space for him to pull up. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=215.0s)]
*  It's already been a minute. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=220.0s)]
*  We made some space for him to pull up. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=221.0s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=223.0s)]
*  It don't matter. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=224.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=225.0s)]
*  I mean, it's 9 minutes by car and 15 minutes by walking, I guess. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=226.5s)]
*  17 minutes by walk and 9 minutes by car. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=232.5s)]
*  All right, we'll take the car. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=234.0s)]
*  Because when we...the reason why I want to take the car instead of walking is because [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=235.5s)]
*  we're going to get stopped. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=239.5s)]
*  Non-f***ing-stop if we walk there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=240.5s)]
*  Because of me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=242.5s)]

*  Are we good? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=252.5s)]
*  Everybody wants a picture with Lolo. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=254.0s)]
*  I don't know why I picked Trump. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=257.0s)]

*  Why? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=325.5s)]
*  Because I don't want to be right behind Marsh. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=326.5s)]
*  Actually, he needs to be in the front. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=328.5s)]

*  Okay. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=369.5s)]
*  How did I get the cafe? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=373.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=374.5s)]
*  I got it from him. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=375.5s)]
*  But, I mean, I have mine as well. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=376.5s)]
*  You got to ask him. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=380.5s)]
*  He bought it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=381.5s)]
*  Pali Roots. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=383.5s)]
*  Do you know Pali Roots? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=386.5s)]
*  No. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=387.5s)]
*  It's an organization that's based out of Palestine. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=388.5s)]
*  I have... [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=393.5s)]
*  He got his. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=395.5s)]
*  We got his in Australia. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=396.5s)]
*  We were at a pro-Palestinian rally in Australia. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=399.0s)]
*  And that's where he got his. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=401.0s)]
*  I know maybe you get from my country. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=403.0s)]
*  From where? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=405.0s)]
*  So, I am from three different countries. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=406.0s)]
*  35 years in America. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=410.0s)]
*  15 years in Germany. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=413.0s)]
*  Before 20 years in Iraq. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=416.0s)]
*  Oh, in Iraq? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=418.0s)]
*  Iran. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=419.0s)]
*  Iran. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=420.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=421.0s)]
*  In Persia and south of Iran, everybody there is selected. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=422.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=426.0s)]
*  That's why I asked you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=427.5s)]
*  Probably Palestine or other organizations. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=429.5s)]
*  Yeah, these are pro-Palestinian organizations. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=434.5s)]
*  They are doing the same. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=437.5s)]
*  That's what we're going to right now. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=438.5s)]
*  We're going to a pro-Palestinian rally right now. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=440.5s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=442.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=443.5s)]
*  So, what do you want to do for protest? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=445.5s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=448.5s)]
*  We want the American government to stop giving arms to Israel. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=450.5s)]
*  We want the American government to apply potentially sanctions to the state of Israel for the crime of... [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=455.0s)]
*  And we want to urge American institutions to boycott and divest from Israeli institutions [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=463.0s)]
*  that play a formative role in the continuation of the Palestinians. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=471.0s)]
*  So, I am with you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=475.0s)]
*  America shouldn't have another country this way. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=477.0s)]
*  Because if the other country can do that, they have to do it themselves. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=481.5s)]
*  But America can't. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=486.5s)]
*  Not from... [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=487.5s)]
*  Exactly, America... [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=488.5s)]
*  Not from my pocket and everything. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=489.5s)]
*  But take other way. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=490.5s)]
*  Do you like... [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=493.5s)]
*  My country Iran is spending whole money on nuclear facility. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=495.5s)]
*  They say we don't want to build nuclear plant, but they can change over the night to nuclear. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=502.5s)]
*  And they say we want to destroy Israel. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=510.0s)]
*  So, if Israel doesn't get help from America, they cannot stay together. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=516.0s)]
*  They are going to need much, much more people killed. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=522.0s)]
*  Since last one and a half years that they killed Israel together, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=526.0s)]
*  too many kids, white women, men, there was a lot of people killed. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=533.5s)]
*  If they get involved in America, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=540.5s)]
*  if America involved in that and doesn't listen to you and us, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=545.5s)]
*  do not give the weapon to Israel, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=552.5s)]
*  then it's going to be deep... [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=555.5s)]
*  Is it? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=558.5s)]
*  Do you know... [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=560.0s)]
*  Do you know some guy called Nostradamus? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=562.0s)]
*  Nostradamus? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=567.0s)]
*  Nostradamus. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=568.0s)]
*  Nostradamus. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=569.0s)]
*  I'm... [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=570.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm familiar. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=571.0s)]
*  You tell me, you want to say something else. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=573.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=576.0s)]
*  You tell me, you're talking about Nostradamus. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=577.0s)]
*  Now I'm interested. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=579.0s)]
*  Okay, now you're interested. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=580.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=582.0s)]
*  As I was a student in Germany, I read his book. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=583.0s)]
*  You know he could see the future, right? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=586.5s)]
*  Allegedly, yeah. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=588.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's the claim. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=589.5s)]
*  Do you know what was the last thing that he could see that? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=590.5s)]
*  He wrote a book about that. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=596.5s)]
*  What was it? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=598.5s)]
*  The people asking them after the Second World War, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=599.5s)]
*  do we have any more war? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=602.5s)]
*  Nostradamus predicted the Second World War? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=605.5s)]
*  No. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=607.5s)]
*  He predicted after the Second World War. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=608.5s)]
*  Because after that, what... [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=610.5s)]
*  What... [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=614.0s)]
*  Do we have any war after that? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=616.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=618.0s)]
*  And he said it will be fought and sticks and stones. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=619.0s)]
*  He concentrate, he answered them later on, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=621.0s)]
*  because he said I have to concentrate [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=624.0s)]
*  to see if I see something. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=626.0s)]
*  And he said that, go ahead and answer me. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=628.0s)]
*  He said that is the Third World War. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=630.0s)]
*  There's three. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=633.0s)]
*  Huh? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=634.0s)]
*  There's another one. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=635.0s)]
*  That is the one, yes. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=636.0s)]
*  Third World War coming. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=637.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=639.0s)]
*  At that time, Israel was not exist yet. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=640.5s)]
*  They say between Jewish and Persia. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=646.5s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=650.5s)]
*  And they name it, Jewish and Persia, Third World War. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=651.5s)]
*  He says everything in this war get destroyed. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=654.5s)]
*  And after that, I don't see [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=659.5s)]
*  thousands and thousands of years no more war. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=662.5s)]
*  So, we are getting close to these [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=667.0s)]
*  not dumbest things that he mentioned. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=670.0s)]
*  So right now, I am with you. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=674.0s)]
*  America shouldn't help the Israel. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=677.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=679.0s)]
*  Who do you got in the Third World War though? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=680.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=855.5s)]
*  He's kind of a socialist, right? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=856.5s)]
*  He was, but he, the way that he went, that was a little bit wrong. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=858.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=865.5s)]
*  Because he was, he supposed to, he was a prime minister. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=866.5s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=872.5s)]
*  Prime minister, he stunned because, because the king was changed [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=873.5s)]
*  in the second world war to his son, which was the last king. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=879.5s)]
*  And he said the king can have, can have a position like a king in Britain, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=885.5s)]
*  or like a Supreme Court here, or any other thing. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=895.5s)]
*  King can be king, but not controlling everything in that country. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=900.5s)]
*  That was a mistake for them because the people at that time, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=905.5s)]
*  they didn't have so much knowledge like European countries, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=909.5s)]
*  like British peoples to the British king. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=914.5s)]
*  Iranian people, knowledge was not that enough like that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=920.5s)]
*  So that means he abused his power, and the Shah of Iran, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=924.5s)]
*  yeah, that was a very good movement at that time. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=929.5s)]
*  If he could change the power of the king like to be power in Britain. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=932.5s)]
*  Do you like the Shah? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=939.5s)]
*  I did a lot of demonstration against the Shah as I was a student in Germany. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=941.5s)]
*  Did you get tortured? Did they, did they arrest you? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=946.5s)]
*  Tortured, no. I was afraid to go for my marriage to Iran. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=948.5s)]
*  My wife, my future wife, at that time, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=952.5s)]
*  I had to get married with my family, her family without me, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=957.5s)]
*  and they came back to Germany to me. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=961.5s)]
*  So we met each other in Germany. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=964.5s)]
*  She said I like to get a ceremony back in Iran with the family. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=966.5s)]
*  Did your friends get arrested by the Shah? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=970.5s)]
*  Did your friends get arrested by the Shah? Did you know people? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=972.5s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=975.5s)]

*  That was a news coming in, in German paper, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=997.5s)]
*  I think from Porter Allgemeine or something like that, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1005.5s)]
*  that tomato and eggs nobody can find in any store. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1008.5s)]
*  In couple of days after that, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1015.5s)]
*  they reported the Iranian people bought it, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1017.5s)]

*  What's the other question? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1029.5s)]
*  No, no, no, I want to ask. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1030.5s)]

*  and if he listen to us what the President Biden did, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1043.5s)]
*  don't do that, yes. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1049.5s)]
*  What did President Biden do that you didn't like? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1052.5s)]
*  Do you know what the President Obama released Iranian money in the old time? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1055.5s)]
*  Did you read about that? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1060.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1062.5s)]
*  And do you know what is this money? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1063.5s)]
*  What is this money? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1065.5s)]
*  This money Shah of Iran at that time sold the oil all over in the world [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1066.5s)]
*  with the right price. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1071.5s)]
*  America told him you have to give us more and bring us the price down. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1073.5s)]
*  America didn't like them and they changed the five countries, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1078.5s)]
*  they changed the Shah to this committee. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1082.5s)]
*  So this money, that is the money that the Shah at that time [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1084.5s)]
*  sold the oil, gas and everything to America at that time, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1090.5s)]
*  if you go you see American gas station, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1094.5s)]
*  people lined up hundreds of people to get the gas for the car [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1098.5s)]
*  or something for home or something like that. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1101.5s)]
*  So they sold it and they didn't pay him at that time [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1105.5s)]
*  and they changed him, the government changed [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1110.5s)]
*  and they took over American embassy in Iran [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1113.5s)]
*  and this money is stuck here. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1116.5s)]
*  And with the interest is half a money. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1119.5s)]
*  So now we told President Obama don't release because this Iranian regime, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1121.5s)]
*  when they get the money they give it to the Hamas, to Lebanon and everything [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1129.5s)]
*  and these people attacking Israel, their own money doesn't go to the people. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1133.5s)]
*  I also changed the new... [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1137.5s)]
*  President Biden released 60 billion dollars one and a half year ago [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1138.5s)]
*  to Iranian government. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1143.5s)]
*  I updated the drop off by the way, sorry. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1145.5s)]
*  But it's like right near. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1147.5s)]
*  Wait, why does it say 29 minutes? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1150.5s)]
*  Okay, we'll walk the rest of it actually. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1153.5s)]
*  How far is that? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1158.5s)]
*  Oh, that is a long walk. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1159.5s)]
*  Two miles. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1160.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1166.5s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1168.5s)]
*  Wait, why did that happen? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1169.5s)]
*  It says 29 minutes because it's closed, the road is closed. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1173.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1178.5s)]
*  Which one? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1179.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1180.5s)]
*  Over there is closed, right? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1181.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think so. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1182.5s)]
*  But now it's open here, we go there. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1183.5s)]
*  It doesn't take that long. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1184.5s)]
*  So, after the election you can choose. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1185.5s)]
*  You can choose what you want. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1187.5s)]
*  But let me tell you what President Biden did. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1189.5s)]
*  He released. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1191.5s)]
*  He released. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1192.5s)]
*  Reservation, cancer. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1194.5s)]
*  Cancer? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1197.5s)]
*  Wait, mine? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1198.5s)]
*  No, another reservation, I got a 230. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1199.5s)]
*  What's your goddamn seatbelt on Alex? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1203.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1205.5s)]
*  Yeah, why are you taking... [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1206.5s)]
*  I thought we were going to hop out. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1207.5s)]
*  Oh, you changed the address, I got a job for $75 and he took it back. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1209.5s)]
*  No, wait, why? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1215.5s)]
*  Because I couldn't make it, that was for 230. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1217.5s)]
*  No. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1220.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, let me see if the job is there or it's gone. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1221.5s)]
*  If it's there, we'll just get out and we'll walk, don't worry. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1225.5s)]
*  It's gone, it's gone, that was for 230. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1227.5s)]
*  Now it's gone. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1231.5s)]
*  Wait, it just like automatically took it off? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1232.5s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1235.5s)]
*  Yeah, because... [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1236.5s)]
*  Taking money from working class people? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1237.5s)]
*  That was my next pickup, 230 at Potomac. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1239.5s)]
*  So, President Biden released one and a half year ago $60 billion, 1 million money. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1243.5s)]
*  Eight days later, as soon as the Hamas gets some of those, they attack Israel. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1249.5s)]
*  So, that's why I am going to like President Trump if he listen to us, not to the government of Israel. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1256.5s)]
*  I don't think that's working out, man. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1265.5s)]
*  But you are probably, what you are protecting, your people protecting Iranian government. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1267.5s)]
*  But Iranian folks are not happy with that. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1273.5s)]
*  Because Iranian government is spending all money for that, 30%, 40%, another 50%, 60% goes to his kids out of the country. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1276.5s)]
*  Doesn't go to Iran, no Iranian people suffering from hunger. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1287.5s)]
*  Did you ever go back to Iran? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1291.5s)]
*  I was last summer there. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1294.5s)]
*  You want to report me? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1296.5s)]
*  No, I don't want to report you. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1298.5s)]
*  What? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1300.5s)]
*  No, no, I am joking. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1304.5s)]
*  So, no, I mean, Lebanon has a right. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1306.5s)]
*  What else did Nusradam say? Did he do any Lado numbers or stuff like that? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1313.5s)]
*  He was talking about President Kennedy. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1317.5s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1319.5s)]
*  He says new man in new country get die and they catch the wrong person. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1321.5s)]
*  That's like so, that could apply to so many guys. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1326.5s)]
*  He says new man in new country. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1330.5s)]
*  New man in new country? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1332.5s)]
*  No, new land, new man in new land. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1333.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1335.5s)]
*  The people saying he means the President. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1337.5s)]
*  Kennedy. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1339.5s)]
*  Don't open the door, car is coming. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1341.5s)]
*  I am not going to open it. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1343.5s)]
*  He was going to open the door. I am glad you called him out. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1344.5s)]
*  I thought he was going to open it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1347.5s)]
*  Okay, so no Shaddam. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1348.5s)]
*  Oh, the thing I was going to say is, so Joe Biden did that too. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1351.5s)]
*  He released a lot of the Iranian oil money that Iran... [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1354.5s)]
*  Six million. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1358.5s)]
*  Six billion. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1359.5s)]
*  Six million. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1360.5s)]
*  I can remember the number. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1361.5s)]
*  But I think, you said you like Mossadegh, right? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1362.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1364.5s)]
*  And Mossadegh wanted to do what? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1365.5s)]
*  He wanted to nationalize the Iranian oil and he wanted the... [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1366.5s)]
*  The idea was like that. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1369.5s)]
*  The people of Iran should be able to have control over their own natural reserves. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1370.5s)]
*  The people of Iran should be able to see the benefits of their own natural reserves as your oil. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1376.5s)]
*  It shouldn't be British petroleum that takes all the money. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1381.5s)]
*  So I think America should not have a say in what Iran gets to do with its own oil. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1384.5s)]
*  And America freezing the assets that another American ally, South Korea, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1391.5s)]
*  was supposed to pay to Iran was already ridiculous to begin with. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1397.5s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1403.5s)]
*  I think that other countries, regardless of their... [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1404.5s)]
*  Pay to Iran what? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1407.5s)]
*  Pay to Iran what? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1408.5s)]
*  Money? For what? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1409.5s)]
*  South Korea bought Iranian oil. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1410.5s)]
*  South Korea bought Iranian oil. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1412.5s)]
*  Six billion dollars worth. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1414.5s)]
*  And then the American government said, you can't pay Iran that money and they froze it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1415.5s)]
*  So the money was just in a bank account. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1421.5s)]
*  They just froze that money. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1423.5s)]
*  So added to the previous money that Iran got. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1424.5s)]
*  Yeah, it was supposed to go to Iran. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1427.5s)]
*  America stopped it from happening. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1428.5s)]
*  Which is two different countries trading with one another. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1430.5s)]
*  Why does America get to have a say in that? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1433.5s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1435.5s)]
*  No, look at here. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1436.5s)]
*  You as a superpower country, you have a right to control the people who are not making war. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1439.5s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1453.5s)]
*  No, look at here. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1454.5s)]
*  Look at here. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1456.5s)]
*  I mean, I disagree with you. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1457.5s)]
*  So then why, what do you say about Russia invading the Ukraine? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1459.5s)]
*  You think it's right or not? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1465.5s)]
*  Russia invading Ukraine? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1467.5s)]
*  No, it's wrong. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1469.5s)]
*  You say Ukraine invading Russia? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1470.5s)]
*  No, Russia invading Ukraine is wrong. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1473.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1475.5s)]
*  What do you mean why? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1476.5s)]
*  Why is wrong? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1477.5s)]
*  Because they're killing people. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1478.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1480.5s)]
*  That's right. It's wrong. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1481.5s)]
*  But you think is that right what he did? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1482.5s)]
*  Who? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1485.5s)]
*  Russia invading Ukraine? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1486.5s)]
*  No. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1488.5s)]
*  Was it a good job or not? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1489.5s)]
*  No, it was not right. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1490.5s)]
*  That is what I'm saying. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1491.5s)]
*  As a control the world, you have to avoid too many wars to kill the people. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1492.5s)]
*  Okay, but the difference... [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1499.5s)]
*  Right now, for Iran, because Iranian people tell them, if you release this money, if you [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1500.5s)]
*  release this money, they come more kill on the way. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1507.5s)]
*  Don't release it. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1510.5s)]
*  But the bad things, I am with you. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1513.5s)]
*  The bad things is, they shouldn't give him the money. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1515.5s)]
*  They shouldn't give him medication that Iranian people needed. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1518.5s)]
*  They shouldn't give him food that Iranian people needed. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1521.5s)]
*  Wait, they shouldn't? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1524.5s)]
*  You're saying America shouldn't let Iran get food and medication? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1526.5s)]
*  No, they should let the cash from America to get the medication. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1529.5s)]
*  We are suffering. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1535.5s)]
*  The people in Iran suffering right now not having medication. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1537.5s)]
*  So that's violent, right? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1540.5s)]
*  That's like it's hurting Iran. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1541.5s)]
*  So America is hurting Iran. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1543.5s)]
*  That's why I am with you that America shouldn't give the money to this government. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1545.5s)]
*  He has to listen to the people like me inside and outside Iran. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1553.5s)]
*  He should. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1557.5s)]

*  35 minutes walking? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1810.76s)]
*  I was listening to incredible theories, and you guys got us out of that car. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1813.76s)]
*  We had to go. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1821.76s)]
*  We weren't moving. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1823.76s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1825.76s)]
*  My cogwheels were moving, though, in my mind. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1827.76s)]
*  He was expanding my brain in ways that I previously thought were impossible. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1831.76s)]
*  I do want to hear more of the Nostradamus stuff. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1835.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1837.76s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1839.76s)]
*  I love Iranians, dude. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1840.76s)]
*  They're so funny. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1842.76s)]
*  Persian onks. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1844.76s)]
*  Persian onks are the best. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1847.76s)]
*  Did you give that guy a good tip? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1855.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1857.76s)]
*  Always. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1859.76s)]
*  I'll be checking back on that. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1860.76s)]
*  Yeah, you got his number? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1862.76s)]
*  Guys, I know you guys don't care. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1864.76s)]
*  What? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1866.76s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1868.76s)]
*  I feel like it's already over. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1869.76s)]
*  It's the only place in the States that you can see them. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1871.76s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1873.76s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1874.76s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1875.76s)]
*  Yeah, because Japanese kids would... [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1876.76s)]
*  They're capital, right? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1878.76s)]
*  What's the lore there? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1879.76s)]

*  Washington Monument, Ottoman Empire. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1882.76s)]
*  Wait. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1888.76s)]
*  The National Society Daughters of the American Revolution. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1889.76s)]
*  Yay. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1892.76s)]
*  I don't know what they do. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1896.76s)]
*  But I love daughters of the revolution. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1899.76s)]
*  I love women. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1902.76s)]
*  Yeah, good one. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1903.76s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1904.76s)]
*  Nice to say it. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1905.76s)]
*  I was going to say I love daughters, which sounds so much worse. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1906.76s)]
*  Yeah, which sounds so bad. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1909.76s)]
*  You still kind of said it. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1915.76s)]
*  No, I didn't say it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1916.76s)]
*  Are we going the right way? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1920.76s)]
*  No. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1922.76s)]
*  Dude. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1923.76s)]
*  Do you have any idea? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1924.76s)]
*  Seems like everybody's walking... [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1926.76s)]
*  We're going the right way, yeah. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1927.76s)]
*  I mean, there's another protest, right? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1929.76s)]
*  It's a little hard to get through to our police station. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1937.76s)]
*  We could just, uh... [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1943.76s)]
*  Join in? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1945.76s)]
*  Well, we could just have the son get arrested. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1946.76s)]
*  I don't know if they are. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1949.76s)]
*  Yeah, that would be sick. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1950.76s)]
*  Why is it that they're like... [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1951.76s)]
*  We could go to the cherry blossoms? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1952.76s)]
*  We could go, yeah, we could go look at the cherry blossoms. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1953.76s)]
*  We could get a hot dog. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1956.76s)]
*  I don't know what they do down here. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1959.76s)]
*  What do they eat in D.C.? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1961.76s)]
*  Is that a cherry? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1965.76s)]
*  That's a cherry blossom, though. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1966.76s)]
*  Is it not? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1969.76s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1970.76s)]
*  My name is French Boy. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1971.76s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1976.76s)]
*  It might be. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1980.76s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1982.76s)]
*  On they go. On they go. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1984.76s)]
*  So yeah, if you notice... [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1990.76s)]
*  If you notice the... [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1993.76s)]
*  Oh shit, yeah, look at the fibers. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1995.76s)]
*  On top of the building. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1998.76s)]
*  I don't like that at all. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=1999.76s)]
*  I mean, we're in D.C. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2002.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2003.76s)]
*  Look. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2004.76s)]
*  They know that... [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2006.76s)]
*  Hassan is giving out free PS5s on the National Mall. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2007.76s)]
*  Oh, please don't say that. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2010.76s)]
*  Can you take a picture? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2013.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2014.76s)]
*  Hello. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2015.76s)]
*  Nice to meet you guys. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2016.76s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2017.76s)]

*  You too. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2020.76s)]
*  Marsh, look at the... [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2021.76s)]
*  If you look at the demographic makeup of a lot of the Elon Musk, like, Doge protesters, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2022.76s)]
*  they're like a lot older. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2029.76s)]
*  And I think, I suspect we'll see a very different... [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2031.76s)]
*  We'll see a very different crowd at the Palestinian rally. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2035.76s)]
*  Welcome, man. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2040.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2045.76s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2046.76s)]
*  I watch a lot of you. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2047.76s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2048.76s)]
*  Thanks for watching. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2050.76s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2051.76s)]
*  Where are you guys going? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2052.76s)]
*  Wherever the wind takes us. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2053.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2054.76s)]
*  Have a good one. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2055.76s)]
*  You too. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2056.76s)]
*  You guys be a minute. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2057.76s)]
*  I just had a hot dog. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2058.76s)]
*  But, yeah. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2059.76s)]
*  A lot of the... [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2060.76s)]
*  Are you calling the profiles of the youth movement? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2061.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2066.76s)]
*  Something I forgot? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2067.76s)]
*  No, no. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2068.76s)]
*  I'm dealing with my other podcast right now. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2069.76s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2072.76s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2073.76s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2074.76s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2075.76s)]
*  I'm not Mike Bepp, so... [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2076.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2077.76s)]
*  So, one of the things I've noticed is that, like, a lot of the pro-democracy, we don't [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2078.76s)]
*  want no tyrants, we don't want no autocrats, messaging, anti-Doge messaging, anti-Elon Musk [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2085.76s)]
*  messaging is coming from older generation, Democratic party loyalists. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2091.76s)]
*  And I think a lot of the younger generation, which is still very critical of all that stuff [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2096.76s)]
*  as well, is more focused on America's involvement with Israel and things of that nature. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2101.76s)]
*  But it's clear to me, considering how many people are walking around and protesting in [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2110.76s)]
*  every direction here in Washington, D.C. on this beautiful day, people are experiencing [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2116.76s)]
*  a lot of discontent, to say the least, about the current administration and the way things [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2123.76s)]
*  are going. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2127.76s)]
*  I've yet to see any 401K-related protest signs, but, you know, the conversation that I have [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2128.76s)]
*  with the state hermit of the New York Times remains true. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2139.76s)]
*  A lot of the base of the Democratic Party, the heart of the Democratic Party, want the [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2144.76s)]
*  Democrats clearly to fight back, but they are especially upset, especially disturbed [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2149.76s)]
*  about Elon Musk and his involvement with Doge undermining, if not altogether dismantling [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2155.76s)]
*  the federal administrative body. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2163.76s)]
*  Here we have the Washington Monument on the right. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2165.76s)]
*  There are a lot of people over there. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2168.76s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2169.76s)]
*  Is that where we're going? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2170.76s)]
*  Nope. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2171.76s)]
*  That's a different process. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2172.76s)]
*  There's just a lot of shit happening today. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2173.76s)]
*  He still doesn't know where we're going. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2176.76s)]
*  Well, he doesn't even know where he is. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2177.76s)]
*  I don't know where I'm at. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2179.76s)]
*  It's a straight shot. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2180.76s)]
*  We're going straight. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2181.76s)]
*  I thought we were in like, I thought we were going to Washington. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2182.76s)]
*  Hi. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2185.76s)]
*  Can I just take a picture with you? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2186.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2187.76s)]
*  I like song call one-call. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2188.76s)]
*  My friend literally, wait, hey, she got a crowd, can I actually FaceTime her? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2189.76s)]
*  We have to keep vlogging. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2194.76s)]
*  She wanted to FaceTime her friend? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2196.76s)]
*  No, people do that all the time. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2199.76s)]
*  And normally I'm down, but this is like not one of those moments. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2201.76s)]
*  That was another level for me. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2207.76s)]
*  I've never been to D.C. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2212.76s)]
*  National Institute of Health saves lives. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2214.76s)]
*  RFP makes measles great again. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2217.76s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2219.76s)]
*  There's like a bajillion of them. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2220.76s)]
*  Thanks for that. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2223.76s)]
*  All right, all right. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2224.76s)]
*  The camera doesn't really do it justice how big it is. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2228.76s)]
*  What is? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2232.76s)]
*  That's what I always say. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2233.76s)]
*  Fucking obelisk. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2234.76s)]
*  It's really big when you see it in person. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2235.76s)]
*  Guys, it's really big in person. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2238.76s)]
*  It's really impressive. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2241.76s)]
*  It's also not the size that matters, it's the motion of the ocean, honestly. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2242.76s)]
*  We're having different conversations. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2247.76s)]
*  It's got great motion. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2249.76s)]
*  Yeah, during the construction of the Washington Monument, only a handful of nations donated. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2251.76s)]
*  Do you know which one of those nations? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2255.76s)]
*  One of the nations that donated to the Washington Monument. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2257.76s)]
*  Turkey, that's huge. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2260.76s)]
*  My people built that brick by brick. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2262.76s)]
*  Did Mexico donate? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2265.76s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2267.76s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2269.76s)]
*  He wouldn't care. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2271.76s)]
*  Ottoman Sultan Abdulmecid sent a marble plaque that helped build the Washington Monument. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2272.76s)]
*  It's inscribed in there too. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2278.76s)]
*  One of the pro-science signs. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2281.76s)]
*  Yeah, more pro-science signs, exactly. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2284.76s)]
*  Save the NIH. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2288.76s)]
*  Save NATO, hands off NATO. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2290.76s)]
*  Well, I haven't seen a hands off NATO sign yet, but I have seen people wearing like Ukraine shirts. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2292.76s)]
*  But I guess that's not like, you know, that's an understandable position to take. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2297.76s)]
*  The Save NATO position on the other hand is one that I consider a bridge. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2302.76s)]
*  One that I consider to be a bridge too far. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2306.76s)]
*  There is an insane amount of pro-Calistani flags up there. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2308.76s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2311.76s)]
*  Is there like a Calistan rally today as well? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2312.76s)]
*  So many goddamn... [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2316.76s)]
*  There's the hands off stuff. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2317.76s)]
*  Hands off. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2319.76s)]
*  Alright, so this is the hands off rally. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2321.76s)]
*  There's also Calistan... [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2323.76s)]
*  There's also Calistan protests happening. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2329.76s)]
*  I guess everybody's like... [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2330.76s)]
*  There's Pikachu. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2333.76s)]
*  Pikachu is here. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2337.76s)]
*  I feel like Peter. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2339.76s)]
*  He's in there. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2341.76s)]
*  You guys see Pikachu? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2343.76s)]
*  I see Pikachu walking in the theater. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2345.76s)]
*  Mine is like, it's sure he's in attendance. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2348.76s)]
*  Pikachu has a long history of standing with Palestine. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2351.76s)]
*  Are they selling? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2356.76s)]
*  Oh, there's MAGA merch here. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2358.76s)]
*  Can I take a picture with you? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2360.76s)]
*  Yeah, quick. Let's do it. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2361.76s)]
*  Dude, thank you. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2365.76s)]
*  Nice to meet you guys. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2366.76s)]
*  Have a good one. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2368.76s)]
*  Alright, do you know which way we go from here? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2369.76s)]
*  It's just straight. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2371.76s)]
*  Okay, so we just... [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2372.76s)]
*  I kind of want to see. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2374.76s)]
*  We just crossed. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2378.76s)]
*  We should go over there and see what they're about. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2379.76s)]
*  Wow! [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2382.76s)]
*  I hate this so much, guys. Can you hear me? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2383.76s)]
*  We should go through that side at least. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2386.76s)]
*  So we can get a better understanding of what this other hands off protest looks like as well. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2388.76s)]
*  It's actually fun because I have a secret microphone to chat. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2397.76s)]
*  So I can just tell them that I have really bad anxiety right now. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2401.76s)]
*  It's on, you rule. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2412.76s)]
*  Nice to meet you guys. Thank you. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2414.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2423.76s)]
*  This is like people in wheelchairs. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2424.76s)]
*  Thanks, Donald. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2426.76s)]
*  Thank you, Tim. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2430.76s)]

*  Listen. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2434.76s)]
*  Listen. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2436.76s)]
*  Industry is alive and well out here. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2437.76s)]
*  What's up, guys? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2439.76s)]
*  They have some pro-Luigi messaging. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2441.76s)]
*  Deny, defend, oppose. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2443.76s)]
*  Okay, maybe I made a mistake by going through here, but... [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2447.76s)]
*  Oh, this is a great museum. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2451.76s)]
*  So, I guess this is a National Sikh Day Parade. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2453.76s)]
*  That's why there's Kalistan banners everywhere. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2458.76s)]
*  Nothing, I think it's great. Love that. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2463.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2470.76s)]
*  RefuseFascism.org? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2472.76s)]
*  Are those PSL? No. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2479.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think they are. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2481.76s)]
*  Are they? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2482.76s)]
*  Maybe, it looks like PSL. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2483.76s)]
*  It doesn't have the PSL font. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2484.76s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2488.76s)]
*  Oh shit, he's wearing the merch and everything. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2489.76s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2491.76s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2493.76s)]
*  Are those PSL signs? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2495.76s)]
*  I'm not sure if someone's in here. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2497.76s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2499.76s)]
*  I just walked around. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2500.76s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2501.76s)]
*  Go walk out there. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2502.76s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2503.76s)]
*  It looks like it has the PSL color scheme, but not necessarily the PSL font. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2504.76s)]
*  What is this? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2514.76s)]
*  With the PSL. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2515.76s)]
*  Person from PSL talking to Hassan right now, if you guys can't hear. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2521.76s)]
*  Yeah, this is where I'm going to right now. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sPC9LwSpo&t=2524.76s)]
