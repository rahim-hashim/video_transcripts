# Jon Stewart On Tense Situation In Israel | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y)
*  I don't think he cracks jokes about October 7. I mean, you don't crack jokes about 9-11. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  You don't crack jokes about October 7. Why is he cracking jokes when it's like [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=5.44s)]
*  Lebanese people that are being exploded? Bro, shut up. Shut up and watch the show. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=8.76s)]
*  I mean, it's just, I hope he turns it around. I'm just saying that like, so far, it's just like calm down. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=13.96s)]
*  We're gonna get to, we're gonna get to the Rashid-e-Talib smears in a second. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=20.16s)]
*  If you really want to exp- But before that, let's talk about John Stewart on [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  Israel-Lebanon and the widening Middle East war. Experience the full cognitive [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  dissonance and language calisthenics that have to be deployed to describe the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=38.8s)]
*  Middle East over the last, I don't know, four, five, six, ten thousand years. How [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  we're describing what's- I give you the golden sound bite brought down from [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=48.4s)]
*  Sinai to explain how f***ing convoluted this has to be. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=54.2s)]
*  What the Israeli government has said and the Biden administration has in many ways [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=60.56s)]
*  subscribed to this idea is de-escalation through escalation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=66.52s)]
*  Or as that is sometimes called, war! That is World War II! Look at the subhead! [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  De-escalation through escalation. I mean, do you even hear yourself? My god, the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=81.16s)]
*  de-escalation through escalation? That phrase is wherever I heard- it's right out of- [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Oh. Hold on a second, let me see if I can find- hold on. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=92.16s)]
*  Wait, there's a longer version of this? In the docket? Oh, here it is. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=95.28s)]
*  Welcome to the Daily Show, ladies and gentlemen! [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=99.88s)]
*  By the way, speaking of Europe, let's talk about the Middle East. As you know, October 7th [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=103.24s)]
*  marks the one-year anniversary of the horrific attack against Israeli citizens, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=106.44s)]
*  the kidnapping of hostages, many of whom have died, many of whom are still being [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=109.36s)]
*  held. Since then, there's also been a horrific war in which doesn't seem to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=112.6s)]
*  have gotten us any closer to getting those hostages released. But luckily for [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=117.24s)]
*  both sides, the United States has been working tirelessly since then towards, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=121.0s)]
*  well, I'll let our former president explain. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=129.12s)]
*  I'm gonna take a little- I just shot ice cream into my eye. Ice cream is- I give [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=159.6s)]
*  the president credit, very dangerous treat. I'm gonna take a big bite of my [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  ice cream cone as I find out how our ceasefire efforts are paying off. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=168.12s)]
*  Israel launching an all-out assault on Hezbollah in Lebanon over the weekend. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=173.84s)]
*  What?! So worth it. Wait, we've been working tirelessly for a ceasefire and then f***ing Lebanon? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=178.16s)]
*  Can't believe it, notorious Jon Stewart doing it again. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=186.64s)]
*  Lebanon?! The whole point was we're gonna downgrade, we're gonna attack the terrorists there, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=189.44s)]
*  we're gonna get the hostages home. What did Lebanon do? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=194.56s)]
*  No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can't accept it either. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=197.92s)]
*  But you've also been wanton rocketing. What kind of rocketing are you doing in, if not wanton? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, that's how little criticism they've faced. By the way, Lebanon is also a country. What [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=208.72s)]
*  makes you think they're gonna accept your rocketing or whatever other James Bond you've been up to? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=214.16s)]
*  Thousands of wireless pagers simultaneously exploding across Lebanon. Exploding pagers. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=219.84s)]
*  Lebanon expected Israel to attack from the south, but instead they attacked from the 1980s. What?! [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=227.28s)]
*  Oh, you know what Lebanon should do? Yeah! Well, Israel got any quarters? By the way, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=233.84s)]
*  quick message for our viewers who are under, let's say, 45. This is a pager. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=238.64s)]
*  This is a pager. I'm gonna put it over here. I don't exactly love the commentary so far because [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=247.2s)]
*  I feel like he's making light of, I mean he's a comedian, his job is to make light of like really [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=252.72s)]
*  horrifying events, but it almost feels like he doesn't calculate the severity of Israel's actions [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=257.12s)]
*  because it is an act of terror which ended up like two kids. So, we're not really sure where we [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=264.56s)]
*  bought those from. So, you see, there was a time back in the olden days when we didn't have cell [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=269.76s)]
*  phones but still wanted to buy drugs. You would ping your local neighborhood dealer on his pager. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=275.84s)]
*  What? And then he would come over and say something like, are you gonna smoke all of this yourself? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=283.92s)]
*  And then you would say, do you want to come in? And the next thing you know, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=289.52s)]
*  you're driving him disconnected. I don't think he cracks jokes about October 7. You know what I mean? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=292.32s)]
*  He don't crack jokes about 9-11. He don't crack jokes about October 7. Why is he cracking jokes [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  when it's like Lebanese people that are being exploded? Bro, shut up. Shut up and watch the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=302.08s)]
*  show. I mean, it's just, I hope he turns it around. I'm just saying that like so far it's just like [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=307.36s)]
*  The point is, stay in school. But yes, Israel, Israel, Israel! Israel remotely exploded all of Hezbollah's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  pagers in walkie-talkies, which is why going forward Hezbollah will limit its communications [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=324.24s)]
*  to the message boards on nudeafrica.com because no one will ever find out the things that you post [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=329.12s)]
*  on nudeafrica.com under the username I am Mark Robertson candidate for North Carolina Governor 836. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=337.76000000000005s)]
*  No one will find out. Now we know the Americans have been working tirelessly on a ceasefire and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=348.16s)]
*  got that's it. That's what he got on the pager explosions. Okay, cool. I mean, that sucks. The [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=354.0s)]
*  person who was telling me to shut the fuck up, suck my ass. To countless hours and all 31 [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  Baskin Robbins flavors apparently, but this new conflagration points to another outcome [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  the United States has been very much trying to avoid from day one since October 7th. It's been [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  one of our primary objectives to prevent the conflict from escalating from spreading in other [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=375.28s)]
*  places, prevent an escalation or widening or deepening of this country. We have been laser [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  focused on trying to prevent that wider war since October 7th. I don't think we need a wider war in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=384.64s)]
*  the Middle East. That's not what I'm looking for. Why would you be looking for that? You know what [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  I'd love a wider war in the Middle East. This is why the New York Times coverage on the matter is [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=393.84s)]
*  so damaging because it gives a permission structure to liberals to laugh about an issue that is like [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  objectively inhumane, a direct act of terror. Okay, that's why even someone like Jon Stewart, who [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=403.52s)]
*  has significantly better opinions on issues like this, will crack jokes like in a careless manner, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=410.96s)]
*  which dulls the severity of the actions taken, which kind of white washes the horrifying acts [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=418.88s)]
*  of terror. It's just, speaking of the mic, little bro, I don't know why I'm really annoyed with [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  chatters today. I just, I feel like there's a bunch of like really annoying people in the chat. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=432.0s)]
*  Well, now that a wider war has broken out in the Middle East, this is President Biden yesterday [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  talking about what we're going to do about it. We're going to do everything we can to keep a wider [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=444.88s)]
*  war from breaking out. How f***ing wide does this war have to be before we call it a wider? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=449.52s)]
*  Without Turkey, it's still technically in the margins. Look, as far as I'm concerned, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=456.0s)]
*  it's not a wide war until it includes Mongolian archers. Come on! What are we doing? And by the way, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=460.32s)]
*  if this isn't the wider war, then what is this? It continues to be a very dangerous situation, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=468.64s)]
*  a very difficult situation, a very difficult volatile situation, and the situation could [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=475.04s)]
*  escalate at any moment. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, so it's not a war, it's a volatile situationship, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=482.56s)]
*  a friends with bomb-a-fits, if you will. For what? What if you really want to experience [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=489.44s)]
*  the full cognitive dissonance and language calisthenics that have to be deployed to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=496.48s)]
*  describe the Middle East over the last, I don't know, four, five, six, ten thousand years. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  How we're describing what's... I give you the golden sound bite brought down from Sinai [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=507.12s)]
*  to explain how convoluted this has to be. What the Israeli government is saying, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=514.48s)]
*  and the Biden administration is in many ways subscribed to this idea, is de-escalation through [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=522.32s)]
*  escalation. Or as that is sometimes called, war! That is World War II! Look at the subhead! [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=530.24s)]
*  De-escalation through escalation! I mean, do you even hear yourself? My God, the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=538.88s)]
*  de-escalation through escalation? That phrase is where... It's right out of... Hold on a second, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=546.4000000000001s)]
*  let me see if I can find... Hold on, I know it's not there. Hold on, let me see if I can find... [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=551.52s)]
*  No, it's not in there. Let me see if I can find... Oh my God, John, that cat has wrecked havoc on your [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=560.0s)]
*  bachelor lifestyle. Although I do take issue with one of Garfield's bromides, I happen to love Mondays. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  It's the start and end. There's no, there's no issue with making jokes, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=576.16s)]
*  chat. I do it all the time. I do it on a daily fucking basis. In a lot of the horrifying segments [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=580.48s)]
*  of reality that I cover, I literally... I covered this exact same story and I cracked jokes in [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=588.48s)]
*  between. It's just that I guess the direction of the jokes oftentimes, or who I make the butt of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=594.72s)]
*  the jokes oftentimes, is the Israeli government. You can make jokes. You can make jokes about the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=602.8000000000001s)]
*  American role in this process. You can make jokes about the Israeli government in this process. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=609.76s)]
*  You can even make jokes about the Lebanese population. It just has to be like, I don't know, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  somewhat tasteful and not tone deaf when you are making a joke about innocent people being blown [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=619.92s)]
*  to bits. It just comes across a little callous. End of every work week. Though I hear Fridays are [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=627.4399999999999s)]
*  nice. But here's the worst part. The country that's providing all the to the Middle East, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=632.48s)]
*  or I guess now we have to call them escalators, seems to have no idea when these are going to be [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  used. We were not notified by the Israelis about their strike or the intended target of their [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=645.52s)]
*  strike. First, this is something we were not aware of or involved in. The United States did not know [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=651.28s)]
*  about nor was it involved in these incidents. Oh, yeah, telling you anything. Have you checked [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=657.68s)]
*  your pager? I mean, my God, there have to be other ways of achieving de-escalation without all this [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=663.5999999999999s)]
*  respectful exchange of missiles. Historically, that part is generally followed by years of sorrow [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=670.16s)]
*  and bloodshed. And we know there have been opportunities for de-escalation, but Netanyahu [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=676.4799999999999s)]
*  did not seem particularly interested in it. Oh, my God. I've criticized Netanyahu. What have I done? Go ahead. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=681.2s)]
*  The people who are criticizing the prime minister, it is shameful, it is pathetic. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=689.84s)]
*  We should be standing shoulder to shoulder with our strongest ally in the Middle East instead of [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=694.72s)]
*  launching this criticism. They criticize them for going too far constantly, and that gives comfort. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=699.2s)]
*  I'm sorry. Criticism of the war is shameful, and it gives comfort to... You know who might be surprised [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=705.76s)]
*  to hear that? The Israelis, who are unbelievably critical of the war and Netanyahu. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=710.96s)]
*  What you gonna say now? Get off my back. You heard what he said. He said... Yeah, dude, Israelis hate [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=724.48s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu so much that his popularity has only grown post-October 7 and has increased [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=730.96s)]
*  tremendously since the incursions into Lebanon. Yeah, it's so funny to point to Benny Gantz, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=737.92s)]
*  by the way, as a guy who hates Benjamin Netanyahu. And it's like, that was our guy [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=743.68s)]
*  that was supposed to be the next leader of Israel. That was the guy that we were positioning on our [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=748.56s)]
*  liberal Zionist off-ramp that we were setting up. Except what happened to that off-ramp? He left the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=754.88s)]
*  coalition. He left the governing coalition in disgrace. And Benjamin Netanyahu was literally... [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=761.12s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is literally more popular than he has been post-October 7 because he opened a new [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=765.84s)]
*  front in the war, by the way, just so you understand. Does anyone have a Google translate on what he [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=772.08s)]
*  said? The prime minister did not look the public in the eye and tell the truth that he won't bring [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=776.72s)]
*  the hostages alive. It's a total failure. The Israeli government, no strategy, no vision. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=780.88s)]
*  He is trying to do everything to prevent a deal. He don't have any intent to end this war. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=788.08s)]
*  Netanyahu is lying as he believes. What the former prime minister of Israel and defense minister are? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=795.12s)]
*  But still, people are going to see this segment and go, all right, maybe Israel isn't perfect. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=805.12s)]
*  But criticizing them feeds the fire. Don't you worry about it. And to that I say no. I believe [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=809.6s)]
*  we'll be fine. I gotta say, not for nothing, but from what I've experienced, it's very resilient. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=814.96s)]
*  And it's not really tied to any event or war or activity or reality. For God's sake, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=822.16s)]
*  Kanye thought we ruined his Adidas deal. We just need orthotics. That's all. We'll survive this war [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=827.52s)]
*  like it survived all wars, going back to the brave Hebrews at Masada. That was the one good joke that [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=834.16s)]
*  he made. See, Rabbi, I was paying attention. You know what? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the blame the Jews [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=839.76s)]
*  from the Black Death, the Spanish Inquisition to the space lasers will all go away if Israel does [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=847.68s)]
*  right and peace will reign. And people will no longer baselessly and conveniently blame the Jews [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=853.76s)]
*  when things don't work out exactly. The problem with this argument is that he's obviously right, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=860.4s)]
*  but is irrelevant to the actions of Israel in terms of it always being a major issue, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=866.0799999999999s)]
*  being at the heart of all fascist movements. The problem, however, is that Israel's actions, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=873.28s)]
*  and more so than Israel's actions, but the justifications for Israel's actions being [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=879.76s)]
*  tied back to Judaism. And also on top of that, the defense of Israel's actions against valid [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=884.64s)]
*  criticism being tied back to a cynical deployment of as a shield does, especially when communicated [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=891.36s)]
*  through every orifice of media by everyone in positions of power does make it incredibly easy [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=897.68s)]
*  for the uninitiated person with a little bit of like unexamined opinions that are just like left [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=904.64s)]
*  out there in the dark to completely adopt the position that Jews control the media. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=912.7199999999999s)]
*  That's it. That's literally it. Israel blows up a school says we're doing this for Judaism and all [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  Jews love us. And then Jake Tapper goes on television and says, if you criticize Israel [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=922.0799999999999s)]
*  blowing up a school year because all Jews love Israel, and all Jews love what Israel is doing, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=926.56s)]
*  then yeah, what is a what is a guy in our Kansas supposed to think? What? He's never met a Jewish [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=931.4399999999999s)]
*  person before. The only thing he knows about Jews is Seinfeld. Okay. In his mind, he's like, I see [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=939.92s)]
*  a lot of Jewish people who are rich. What? What is the I mean, what do you what is he supposed to [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=947.3599999999999s)]
*  think? He's never thought about these issues. He's heard, you know, Jews are very good with money. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=952.64s)]
*  Okay. He's probably even heard Jews control the media before maybe didn't put a lot of thought [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=959.76s)]
*  or effort into understanding what that means and why it's incorrect. But when that guy turns on [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=964.08s)]
*  television, and here's this from every news outlet, what is he supposed to think? Where is his casual [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  supposed to go? It's going to become full blown. The amount of people I'm willing to fucking bet [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  the amount of people have you fact check who owns every media? Yes. See, and there's people doing [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=981.92s)]
*  that right now in the chat. Have you fact check who owns every major media outlet? Dude, if you [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=986.4799999999999s)]
*  think it's Jews, and you also think that there is a monolithic force that dictates that like Jews [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=991.52s)]
*  operate on the boundaries of Israel and defending Israel's actions, you are and stupid. The major [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=998.64s)]
*  people that own media outlets are not Jews, by the way, it's not what is so Yes, there are so many [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1005.92s)]
*  wasps. Okay. There are it's mostly wasps that own most of and control most of the important [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1011.28s)]
*  vectors of power. But it does not matter because they're not operating in a monolithic understanding [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1019.52s)]
*  beyond being capital owners. Okay, that's it. Zionism across the board. And the way that it has [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1025.68s)]
*  turned out these results are a byproduct of social conditioning. Okay, there are far more [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1035.12s)]
*  evangelical Zionists that are rabid supporters of Israel, then there are Zionist Jews. Okay. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1043.2s)]
*  There are more evangelical rabid evangelical Zionists, then there are Jews across the board. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1052.08s)]
*  Okay, this is why I routinely repeat the correct statement, the true fact that if magically tomorrow, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1058.96s)]
*  every single American Jew universally condemned the state of Israel said it's an apartheid, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1069.2s)]
*  said that they no longer recognize what it once was doesn't mean that a higher percent of [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1076.32s)]
*  evangelicals are you are wrong. You are literally wrong. Okay, the Jewish support for the state of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1080.8s)]
*  Israel is not as black and white as you think it is. A lot of that is is never perfectly defined. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1089.12s)]
*  Why is it never perfectly defined because institutions that are supposed to deal with [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1098.96s)]
*  want to maintain the idea that Israel is a Jewish ethno state and that's good and all Jews like it [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1102.56s)]
*  the way it is and all Jews want to defend it. Okay, so you never get like a full blown accurate, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1109.12s)]
*  you never get full blown accurate analysis on the subject matter. Okay, but if you think that a [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1116.0s)]
*  higher percentage of Jews are pro-Israel with the same severity, you can look at the numbers. Who [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1122.6399999999999s)]
*  gives more money to the state of Israel, specifically the settler projects. If you think Jews make up a [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1129.36s)]
*  higher percentage of the donations or if you think Jews are donating more money to Israel than [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1136.08s)]
*  evangelical Christians, you are wrong. Okay, it's funny because even the inception of Israel [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1144.24s)]
*  in the inception of Israel under the Balfour declaration, Lord Balfour was an [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1150.8s)]
*  person but he was motivated by Christian Zionists and the one that literally said no dog we shouldn't [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  ship all the Jews to Israel or not Israel at the time British Mandate Palestine was a Jewish guy. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1163.44s)]
*  The one guy who openly spoke out against it was a Jew. Christian Zionism predated [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1170.88s)]
*  Jewish Zionism. Most Jews in America in spite of their insane amounts of insane amounts of [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1178.0s)]
*  social conditioning that they get early on have damn near identical perspectives on the maintenance [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1187.76s)]
*  of the state of Israel as everybody else. Okay, that's it. That is just the truth. When you look [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1194.8s)]
*  at it by demographics, when you break it down by demographics, young Jews under the age of 35, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1201.6s)]
*  many of which are in here as well. Young Jews under the age of 35 and their opinion on Israel [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1207.52s)]
*  is damn near identical to every other demographic under the age of 35. What it was a Jewish doctor [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1214.08s)]
*  sounding like Kanye. What because I'm saying because I'm speaking to the canard that all [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1222.08s)]
*  Jews are monolithic in their understanding of any issue let alone Israel. Israel's taking urgent [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1228.32s)]
*  steps to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in the northern front with Hezbollah [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1235.52s)]
*  conflict. Dog, they're looking for a diplomatic solution to the problem that they started. What [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1238.8s)]
*  the f***? Would you also say that most Jewish people in the US but also in general are generally [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1244.72s)]
*  uninformed about what's happening and rather are just defending the state of Israel? I mean sure, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1249.28s)]
*  that's part of it. If they watch only mainstream media then yes, their opinion is going to be [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1253.68s)]
*  their opinion is going to be similar to your Christian dad. You know what I mean? It's just [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1260.24s)]
*  the same the way they want them to. This is the most important election in the history of the [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1264.8s)]
*  United States. I'm not going to call this as a prediction but in my opinion the Jewish people [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1271.6s)]
*  would have a lot to do with a loss if I'm at 40 percent. Son of a- So like this speech was actually [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1277.12s)]
*  really informative. Like his entire uh his entire speech at the seminar was actually quite informative [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1285.36s)]
*  and not just because of what he said or what he didn't say but also because of the way that the [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1293.04s)]
*  media covered it. Like a lot of people hyper focused on him saying this which is objectively [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1297.68s)]
*  stupid right? But many people did not talk about all the other things that he said. The many [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1302.24s)]
*  instances where he basically defended Miriam Adelson said I gave Sheldon and Miriam everything [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1308.08s)]
*  they wanted like pure graft okay? Pure graft across the board. He brought up Miriam Adelson by name [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1313.84s)]
*  because of Miriam Adelson's donations and it's odd that mainstream media did not even cover that [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1322.64s)]
*  at all. Normally if Donald Trump- if Donald Trump was uh you know blubbing this hard about any other [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1328.88s)]
*  issue the media would make mincemeat out of that. He literally personally said he gave Golan Heights [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1336.0s)]
*  to Israel because he got money from Sheldon Adelson. I'm gonna try to find this thing hold on. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1342.4s)]
*  Michael Treacy- I can't believe I'm saying this but Michael Treacy clipped it and then um Felix [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1348.8s)]
*  actually quote retweeted it and I just want to show you that clip again. Yeah it's deeply accepted [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1355.76s)]
*  this happened. I recognize Israel just as I promised I recognize Israel's eternal capital and [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1361.44s)]
*  Odyssey in Jerusalem. Jerusalem became the capital. I also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1368.24s)]
*  Heights. You know Miriam and Sheldon would come into the White House probably almost more than [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1375.04s)]
*  anybody outside of people that work there and they were always after and as soon as I give them [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1381.28s)]
*  something always for Israel as soon as I'd give them something they'd want something else. I say [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1386.72s)]
*  give me a couple of weeks will you please? But I gave them the Golan Heights and they never even [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1390.96s)]
*  asked for it. You know for 72 years they've been trying to do the Golan Heights right and uh even [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1395.28s)]
*  Sheldon didn't have the nerve but I said you know what I said to David Friedman give me a quick [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1402.56s)]
*  lesson like five minutes or less on the Golan Heights and he did and I said let's do it we got [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1407.6s)]
*  it done in about 15 minutes. Michael Treacy says take note of which Trump comments provoke controversy [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1412.48s)]
*  and which don't. Trump said this week that he gave Golan Heights to Sheldon and Miriam Adelson his [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1417.9199999999998s)]
*  top funders who came to the White House almost more than anybody not a peep about this brazen [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1421.6s)]
*  admission of graft. Now one must ask the question why they didn't cover this aspect of the story [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1426.24s)]
*  or why why they didn't even talk about Donald Trump's I guess objectively correct statements [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1433.36s)]
*  in terms of like anti-semitism rising in college campuses because they believe it too and they agree [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1439.68s)]
*  with it that's why okay and the great question exactly the real follow-up to that is because [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1445.84s)]
*  Biden did nothing to undo it why would he do that because Biden is also an ultra-zionist [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1450.56s)]
*  uh [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1455.44s)]
*  the entire time he kept saying I gave everything you want okay I gave everything you want to you [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1463.28s)]
*  Jews why won't you vote for me you must be cursed that's what he said okay now obviously [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1472.0800000000002s)]
*  from my perspective that is an utterly insane and deeply anti-semitic thing to say and to think [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1480.4s)]
*  right not because of the you Jews part but because it comes with the underlying false notion [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  that all Jews give about in America is Israel okay yeah he said you must you have a curse okay [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1494.08s)]
*  it is the the underlying premise there is that Jews are a monolithic force that exclusively cares [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1500.96s)]
*  about Israel and nothing else when making their electoral decisions this is what they care about [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1506.88s)]
*  okay now the hilarious side of this and the reason why the media doesn't really cover that that much [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1512.24s)]
*  is because they also repeat this false notion but in a woke way every time you say 90 percent of [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1518.72s)]
*  Jews are Zionists they love Israel all they care about is Israel that's the only thing that motivates [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1525.5200000000002s)]
*  them we can't make a decision on Israel because then Jews won't vote for Kamala Harris like all [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1532.64s)]
*  this is just woke anti-semitism okay it is the woke side saying the exact same thing that the [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1538.16s)]
*  Nazis say it is objectively false okay it is not correct it is incorrect I don't give a what your [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1547.2s)]
*  background is you could be a Jewish person telling me this I don't give a I will not agree that 90 [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1554.0s)]
*  percent of Jews believe that like what Israel is doing is right because I unlike whoever is saying [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1562.24s)]
*  that okay recognize how deeply of an anti-semitic sentiment that is okay maybe in the heat of the [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1569.52s)]
*  moment you might forget what Israel is doing or the way that people analyze what Israel is doing [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1577.44s)]
*  because they can see the atrocities but when you come out as a defensive posture and slap on Judaism [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1584.48s)]
*  in defense of the state of Israel okay well sorry but you are creating more anti-semitism [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1592.08s)]
*  it's just the truth straight up that's the reason why I don't they don't actually talk about [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1599.36s)]
*  Donald Trump's you know additional graft or all of his statements about like anti-semitism rising [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1605.04s)]
*  in the country right the reason why they don't talk about it is because they also agree with [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1611.1999999999998s)]
*  the underlying premise even if they don't actually agree or believe it they say it anyway [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1616.56s)]
*  because they think it is a good deployment it is a good way to defend Israel's actions and to [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1621.84s)]
*  silence the naysayers by simply claiming you are anti-semitic it is ridiculous [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1629.52s)]
*  ah [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8P1_TSdp_Y&t=1636.0s)]
