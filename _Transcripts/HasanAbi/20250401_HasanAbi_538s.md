# Elon Musk Joins "The Five" | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls)
*  They're like, we want our activist judges in every court. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=0.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=4.84s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=6.24s)]
*  They're not, they're just pretending to be judges. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=7.24s)]
*  Big money is interfering in the political affairs of this country, which is why I, the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=10.72s)]
*  representation, the physical manifestation of big money interfering in politics and interfering [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=15.84s)]
*  in politics with the big money that I have in order to put my activist judge in a position [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=21.1s)]
*  of power. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=27.26s)]
*  That's it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  Also Elon Musk is on the file. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  S of amounts of money off of the federal government, like Nancy Pelosi. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  Please. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=40.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=41.900000000000006s)]
*  So we've been counted. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=44.02s)]
*  There's really so much for it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=46.94s)]
*  It's deciding. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=47.94s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=48.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=49.94s)]
*  For a f**king. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=50.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=51.94s)]
*  For, for. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=52.94s)]
*  Have you bought merchandise from any other goddamn T any other goddamn streamer? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=54.9s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=59.28s)]
*  So yeah, in comparison to a product made in Indonesia at PacSun. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=60.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=67.86s)]
*  In that regard as well, because these, these are, these are fake charities where mostly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=68.86s)]
*  Democrats and wasn't well, it's, I don't want to be fair. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=74.94s)]
*  Sometimes a little bit of Republican in there because they sometimes throw the Republicans [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=78.42s)]
*  a bone to say, Hey, be quiet about this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=80.9s)]
*  So it's, so it's that's, that's where, that's where you start getting the unit party thing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=83.61999999999999s)]
*  going on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=87.58s)]
*  But it is overwhelmingly to Democrats. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=89.38s)]
*  And they give these billions of dollars to NGOs run by Democrats that then go through [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=92.46s)]
*  a whole network of additional NGOs, it's a giant money laundering scheme. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Really at this point, I think the word NGO and money laundering are almost synonymous. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=104.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=109.89999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=110.89999999999999s)]
*  Makes sense to me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=112.66s)]
*  Kennedy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=113.94s)]
*  Hello, judge. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=114.94s)]
*  And hello, Elon. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=115.94s)]
*  Welcome to the five. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=116.94s)]
*  Great to talk to you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=117.94s)]
*  Hi. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=118.94s)]
*  So let's, let's talk a little bit about some of the anti-Tesla violence. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=119.94s)]
*  Your car company was. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=126.58s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=128.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=129.42s)]
*  I mean, it was, it was a leftist dream come true. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=130.42s)]
*  It was technologically advanced. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=133.34s)]
*  It was the word of mouth was better than any car company, arguably on the market. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=135.85999999999999s)]
*  And now the left is trying to make it a pariah by tying their anti-Elon politics to violence. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  How do you talk the unhinged off the ledge and how do you counter that violence that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  you're seeing at Tesla dealerships? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  Yes, it is remarkable that there is so much violence. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=159.22s)]
*  You know, people have burned cars that fired bullets into dealerships. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=165.42s)]
*  They've scratched swastikas into Teslas of the innocent people that have, they're just [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=169.66000000000003s)]
*  going about their lives. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=174.82000000000002s)]
*  They've done nothing wrong. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=175.82000000000002s)]
*  And Tesla has done nothing wrong as a company. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=176.82000000000002s)]
*  And so I find it ironic and incredibly hypocritical. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=179.62s)]
*  Uh oh. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  Clap. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=185.62s)]
*  20 years simply for watching things at January 6th, but not actually doing any violence. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  You don't hear a single word from them about the actual violence happening against Tesla. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=196.3s)]
*  What incredible hypocrites they are. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=201.94s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=204.5s)]
*  I mean, really this is fundamentally a case of terrorism. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=206.5s)]
*  It's wide scale domestic terrorism with the purpose of intimidation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=213.18s)]
*  And it's hard. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  Vandalizing your ugly ass car. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  Look at these terrorists, dude. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  What we actually have to get to are the people who are organizing and paying for these attacks [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=223.98s)]
*  and protests. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=228.74s)]
*  That's who we really need to go after. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=230.34s)]
*  Because the people who are actually throwing the Molotov cocktails, they are the foot soldiers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=232.54s)]
*  But we need to go after the generals. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=238.06s)]
*  And we're going to do so. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=240.1s)]
*  The president has made it very clear that we're going to go after those that are paying [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=241.38s)]
*  and organizing these violent attacks. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=244.62s)]
*  And Attorney General Bondi has said the same thing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=248.02s)]
*  I believe that that is exactly what will happen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=251.02s)]
*  Do you know who they are? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=253.58s)]
*  We're coming for them. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=254.58s)]
*  Do you know who those generals are? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=255.58s)]
*  We know. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=256.58s)]
*  We do. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=257.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=258.58s)]
*  And hopefully the prosecution will be for Rico and an organized criminal enterprise, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=259.58s)]
*  which makes the penalties even more serious. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=266.18s)]
*  And now to Jessica. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=269.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=270.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=271.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=272.5s)]
*  These are serious crimes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=273.5s)]
*  Come on, Jessica. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=276.5s)]
*  Come on. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=279.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=284.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=285.5s)]
*  And I hope they see this segment. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=286.5s)]
*  Well, we'll play it again. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=289.5s)]
*  Jessica. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=290.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=291.5s)]
*  Well, liberal Tesla lover here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=292.5s)]
*  My sister has two in her family, so I have not thrown any recently. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=294.14s)]
*  But I wanted to talk to you about what DOJ has been doing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=297.5s)]
*  So you've been making cuts to a lot of the agencies that have open investigations and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=302.94s)]
*  regulatory battles with your companies. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=307.94s)]
*  At the same time, you continue to get billions in government contracts. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=310.5s)]
*  Tesla gets billions in subsidies. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=314.54s)]
*  How do you explain that to the American people? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=317.06s)]
*  Well, everything that DOJ does is an open book. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=320.06s)]
*  So I think the most transparent action, the most transparent organization in government [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=324.62s)]
*  ever, every single DOJ action is listed on the DOJ.gov website. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  It's also listed on the X handle. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=335.5s)]
*  If anyone has a concern about any one of those actions, they can bring that up. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=337.82s)]
*  They can raise that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=341.5s)]
*  And I do want to say, sometimes we make a mistake. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=342.5s)]
*  Nobody bats a thousand. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=345.1s)]
*  We will at times make a mistake, but make a mistake, we'll act very quickly to correct it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=346.5s)]
*  I am under such an extreme spotlight, so much scrutiny, that it's literally impossible [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=352.78s)]
*  for me to get away with anything nefarious. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=356.9s)]
*  And obviously, no doubt I wish to. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=359.38s)]
*  So this is a case where we have radical transparency. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=361.74s)]
*  We're actually willing to admit that we do make mistakes. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=368.94s)]
*  Often people are not willing to admit they make mistakes, but we are. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=372.06s)]
*  But we want to emphasize we fix them quickly and we're trying to do the right thing for [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=375.38s)]
*  the American taxpayer, for the American people. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=379.18s)]
*  And I think history will be the judge that what we've done here and what we're doing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=381.53999999999996s)]
*  is a very good thing for the strength and future of America. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=385.74s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=389.9s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=390.9s)]
*  So, Elon, for one last time, why don't you remind the viewers why... [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=391.9s)]
*  They 100% were like, Jessica, don't f*** up the bag here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=395.9s)]
*  We got our glorious king. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=398.46s)]
*  Our glorious king. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=400.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=401.7s)]
*  So the reason that, because it does seem like, why isn't this rather a small thing? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=402.7s)]
*  It's happening, ironically, of course, on April Fool's Day. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=406.5s)]
*  This is not an April Fool's joke. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=409.17999999999995s)]
*  This is very real. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  So a judge-race election in Wisconsin will decide whether or not the Democrats can gerrymander [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=413.9s)]
*  Wisconsin in order to remove House seats from Republican to Democrat. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=424.26s)]
*  Because of the razor-thin margins in the House, that would mean potentially a flip of the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=428.85999999999996s)]
*  House from Republican to Democrat. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=433.38s)]
*  That means that at the next election, roughly less than two years from now, the House will [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=436.82s)]
*  then immediately take action to stop the President's agenda. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=443.46s)]
*  And it's always worth reminding people the President was elected with the majority of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=449.38s)]
*  the people of America. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  The majority, a meaningful majority of the popular vote. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  So all the President is trying to do is implement the will of the people. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=457.82s)]
*  And they are trying to stop the will of the people through judicial trickery. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=463.17999999999995s)]
*  And in fact, in general, there is a huge problem with activists that are actually politicians [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=468.66s)]
*  in judges' robes. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=474.62s)]
*  And that needs to stop. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  It's undermining the integrity, the reality, and the concept. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=478.16s)]
*  We want our activist judges in every court. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=481.58000000000004s)]
*  That's it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=485.14000000000004s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=486.62s)]
*  They're not just pretending to be judges. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=487.62s)]
*  Big money is interfering in the political affairs of this country, which is why I, the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=491.1s)]
*  the physical manifestation of big money interfering in politics, interfering in politics with [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=497.1s)]
*  the big money that I have in order to put my activist judge in a position of power. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=502.26000000000005s)]
*  Incredible stuff. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=509.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=510.62s)]
*  Elon Musk, thank you so much for being with us on The Five. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnQ29jvDls&t=511.62s)]
