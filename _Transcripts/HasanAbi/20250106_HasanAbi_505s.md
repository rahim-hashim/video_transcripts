# Why I Prefer Playing Basketball | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0)
*  I love having fun with friends. I love gaming with friends. It's incredibly fun. I love playing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=0.0s)]
*  video games on stream and I will continue to do so. It's just that I know that I will never put [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=6.0s)]
*  enough initiative. I will never put enough initiative and enough seriousness to train [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=14.4s)]
*  to get better at gaming. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=23.2s)]
*  I think I'm done playing. It's no longer fun. I mean, it's a lot of fun. I'm deeply addicted [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=24.64s)]
*  to it. But yesterday we did some in houses and I just got so I got stomped on so hard [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=36.64s)]
*  and I just, I'm not, I'm not a gamer. I need to hang it up. I need to quit every time a new [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=43.28s)]
*  game comes out. The first couple of weeks, I am around the same level as everyone else [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=50.16s)]
*  because the game has just come out and all of my friends and I are usually playing at the same [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=58.16s)]
*  level. We're getting like around the same number of kills. We're, we're playing against people who [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  are also, you know, competitive with us. And then a month into the game, virtually every single [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=69.92s)]
*  person just blows past me. Okay. It always happens. And I know why I think part of it is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=78.72s)]
*  because I just don't play as much as they do. They play eight hours every single day. And of course, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=86.96s)]
*  if you do that, you're going to get better and I'm never going to be able to do that. I am too high [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=91.52s)]
*  elo when it comes to this yapping. And I'm also not good enough. I'm just simply not like naturally [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=97.12s)]
*  good enough to not play as much like will, will, for example, he plays a lot more than I do, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=105.44s)]
*  but even then will is also naturally very good at games, right? He's very good at games. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=110.32s)]
*  So even if he were to play like three to four hours every day, which I don't even do right. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=116.48s)]
*  He will still be able to play it like a competitive level. Whereas [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=123.12s)]
*  I am just not very good at games. And it's just something I got to recognize. It sucks. It sucks. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=127.36s)]
*  But the age of 33, the year of 33, as I turned 34 later in this year, I will come to that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=132.56s)]
*  recognition. You know, you could be, don't not January 10 next season, actual balances and Giyot [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=139.84s)]
*  strategist joining in. Yeah. I know venom is going to get a buff. So then I'll show everybody [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=147.04s)]
*  what it truly, what truly matters, whether you'd be fine. If you've made a fun group and play ranked [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=151.44s)]
*  in house, they're going to be sweaty as hell. I just, I just feed too much anyway, whatever. It [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  doesn't matter. They know life every game. Don't stress it, dude. I know. Here's the thing though. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=160.08s)]
*  Here's the thing though. It's supposed to be fun. It like gaming is supposed to be fun. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=166.24s)]
*  I did do a decent push here, but that's like pretty much it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=171.36s)]
*  Definitely a better, this is a better team. So far, I think we're doing it. We're doing it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=175.36s)]
*  All right. Now we get through this fun show. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We got it. We got it. I can, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=181.84s)]
*  I can die back line. There was a couple of really good moments I had with the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=186.64s)]
*  you should keep at it, man. It's going to be shroom of the year. What I think you would have [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=204.64s)]
*  more fun if you looked at chat a lot less during gaming. I want to keep looking at chat though, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  cause chap is supposed to make it fun. I also want to keep looking at chat because you know, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  it's more entertaining that way when there's back and forth, but that was a good play. What do you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=216.56s)]
*  mean? No, I know. I'm saying that I played well there. Yeah. Also I don't have the background [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=221.28s)]
*  of like playing overwatch half. These people already have the intrinsic understanding of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=225.84s)]
*  positioning team comp ability. Time is such are coming from games like Overwatch. You're [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=229.52s)]
*  going to just put in the work if you want to catch up. I know. And I'm just not going to put in the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=232.56s)]
*  work. That's the problem. Cause this is my most like old man attitude, but at the end of the day, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  it's night as Jason Lewin famously said, no, at the end of the day, I just think it's a game [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=244.55999999999997s)]
*  and it's not worth it. This is my oldest man take like for me, basketball is always worth it. Why? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=251.11999999999998s)]
*  Because there's like a secondary thing that I'm getting out of it. It's not just like [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=259.12s)]
*  the pure feeling of victory is good, but I'm also, even if I lose, I feel like I've one learned [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=263.36s)]
*  something. Okay. And two, I'm physically excelling. Even if I'm losing, I'm still [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=271.28s)]
*  getting cardio out of it. Whereas when I play video games, I don't feel that way. It's just [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=277.52s)]
*  because I'm old. I'm an old man. I know. And I'm not saying that this is the right approach to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  the world. I love having fun with friends. I love gaming with friends. It's incredibly fun. I love [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  playing video games on stream and I will continue to do so. It's just that I know that I will never [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=294.32s)]
*  put enough initiative. I will never put enough initiative and enough seriousness to train [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=302.4s)]
*  to get better at gaming. It's just never going to happen. I'm never going to do it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=311.76s)]
*  LeBron plays games and it's kind of ass is okay. That's what I mean. It's just like, I will always [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=315.68s)]
*  enjoy it and I'll always keep playing games. Bro is a man of sphere influencer, maximizes efficiency [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=319.68s)]
*  in outputs, even in hobbies. Lamar. Yeah. Playing basketball. You don't have a chance of playing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=324.0s)]
*  as an athlete from across the world. No, but oh no, that's actually a great example. I would [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=329.28s)]
*  love the opportunity to play against the athlete. And I do sometimes play against athletes, like [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=335.52s)]
*  pro players, overseas players and the like, you know, D1 players and it's fun. It's incredible. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=340.4s)]
*  It's an amazing opportunity. Whereas I don't feel that way when I play video games. So I guess that's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=345.84s)]
*  a difference as well. Like if there's a, if there's actually a pro player on the other team [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=351.28s)]
*  and they're just cooking me, I don't feel the exact same way. Whereas if I were, if I had the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=355.44s)]
*  opportunity to play against like a pro athlete in basketball, that is fantastic. That's an [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=359.76s)]
*  opportunity to learn. That's an opportunity to get better. Like that's an opportunity to test yourself. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=365.2s)]
*  I'm always interested in playing against players that are infinitely better than me in basketball. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=370.32s)]
*  Whereas playing against players that are not playing as players that are infinitely better [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  than me, which is very easy to find in the realm of gaming. I don't like. Yeah. It's also because [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=380.56s)]
*  I've probably spent a lot more time and a lot more investment into basketball. And I'm a lot [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=387.12s)]
*  better at basketball than the average person than I am at gaming. Then the average streamer wouldn't [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=391.44s)]
*  say the average person, but definitely the average streamer. Anyway, where were we? I don't know why [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=397.12s)]
*  I just like talked about that so much. So that's just my thing. How do you feel playing basketball [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=401.6s)]
*  against people who aren't as good? I mean, it's not as fun. I think playing against people who are [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=407.04s)]
*  very good is, is a lot more fun than playing against people who aren't as good. Also competitive [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  video games utilize a strictly ego-based reward system that deprives you of reward frequently [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  and inevitably frustrates you. Yeah. But no, no, no. I think it's also because I just don't understand. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't understand why I lost or what I'm doing wrong. I'm just not very good. Does that make sense? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=425.44s)]
*  Like in basketball, I know where my weaknesses are. I know what I need to fix. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  And there's plenty, right? There's plenty of room for improvement, of course, for everything. But [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=435.52s)]
*  like, I know if I were to think about basketball as a video game, right? Like I know my, I know [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  what my position is in a starting five. I know what role I can play and depending on the team comp, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=449.12s)]
*  I can fulfill other roles as well. There are certain roles that I just simply cannot fulfill. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=455.84s)]
*  I can't play guard. I can't play point guard, right? But, but with gaming, I just like, I'm [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  confused all the time. I'm so confused when I play a game like marble rivals, as much as I enjoy it, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=467.84s)]
*  I'm still kind of confused. I'm like, what's going on? I get overwhelmed. I don't know. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=474.0s)]
*  It's kind of sad, but it is the truth. I'm an old man and it's just, there's no reason to lie about [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  it. Okay. I'm an old man and I just don't get it. I'll still keep playing it, but I just gotta, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=486.4s)]
*  I just gotta know that I'm bad and not try to be good anyway, but here's what I am good at. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReMDFc-Zs0&t=492.96s)]
