*  Look at that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=7.28s)]
*  Yeah, you've been a dirty boy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=8.52s)]
*  You've been a dirty, spud boy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=10.52s)]
*  A spuddy guy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=14.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, but you don't need the profession. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=20.72s)]
*  She's in training. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=22.12s)]
*  I'm flipping it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=22.92s)]
*  You know he might actually stream with you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=23.64s)]
*  You do. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=24.64s)]
*  He does, actually. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=25.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why you're... [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=26.48s)]
*  Alright, we're back, we're back. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=27.64s)]
*  Also, I don't... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=29.24s)]
*  Why are you besmirching his name? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=29.88s)]
*  Yeah, why are you besmirching the good reputation of Christians? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=31.04s)]
*  It's crazy, I kind of forgot what that meant, too. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=33.4s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=36.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=37.56s)]
*  Classic. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=38.2s)]
*  I think it is alarming that you forgot already. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=38.68s)]
*  The word besmirch? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=41.32s)]
*  Well, you should use simpler words for simpler people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=42.8s)]
*  Don't describe people as being simple. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=46.64s)]
*  Pride Month is literally like a competition. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=48.72s)]
*  Hold on, wait, wait. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=49.72s)]
*  I wasn't talking about gay people. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=50.4s)]
*  I was talking about people in general. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=52.2s)]
*  That is exactly what you were saying. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you were saying... [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=54.2s)]
*  Don't even try to read the text like what you're saying. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Considering that, yeah, your argument was that like... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=56.0s)]
*  That's the language of the proletariat. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=58.4s)]
*  Marge, I'm getting a hotel room for you, by the way, for DreamCon. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=60.72s)]

*  Hey, can someone post a meme right now? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=65.52s)]
*  Marge, we need to do this right now with no notice. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=67.12s)]
*  Okay, smile. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=69.44s)]
*  Yeah, you will. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  What if I had plans next week? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=71.2s)]
*  Well, I texted you in the group chat and you said yes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=72.96s)]
*  Yesterday, you told me yesterday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=75.0s)]
*  Marge, you need to go on strike. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=76.44s)]
*  No, I'm down. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=78.56s)]
*  You need to unionize. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=79.16s)]
*  I'll join you in a union. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=80.2s)]
*  In the hotel room, I expect it to be a two-bedroom suite, five-star hotel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=80.96s)]
*  You're going to DreamCon next week? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=84.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=85.84s)]

*  We'll see if Austin gets out of the friend zone. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=243.6s)]
*  Sometimes we do. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=245.88s)]
*  Sometimes I have gay sex with my roommate. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=247.4s)]
*  Sometimes gay sex. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=249.48s)]
*  But we're not gay. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=250.12s)]
*  But sometimes it's straight. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=251.32s)]
*  Anyway, so you gained how much? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=254.0s)]
*  Don't move away from the last statement that you just, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=258.08s)]
*  what do you mean you have straights sometimes? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=261.8s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=263.68s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=264.48s)]
*  I don't know how. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=265.68s)]
*  I don't know who gained that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=266.88s)]
*  You know, he keeps his socks on. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=273.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=275.2s)]

*  That's how you know it's straight sex [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=277.0s)]
*  instead of the gay one. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=278.24s)]
*  No, sometimes it's just boring, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=279.52s)]
*  which is like that's why. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=280.92s)]

*  No, I'm kidding. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=285.36s)]

*  I'm excited. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  Not yours. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=290.24s)]
*  No, it's never boring. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=290.8s)]
*  No one believes it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=292.36s)]
*  I didn't realize. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  I went for the joke without thinking about the insult. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=294.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was classic. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=298.92s)]

*  He's not ashamed of this part of his culture, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=420.68s)]
*  but the rest of it he is. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=421.96s)]
*  He doesn't claim any of that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=423.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  War on Terror wasn't worth it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=652.52s)]
*  Seven trillion dollars spent, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=655.12s)]
*  one million dead Iraqis. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=657.1999999999999s)]

*  Well, no. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=660.56s)]
*  What's interesting about it is in the documentary [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=661.4s)]
*  that I did find interesting is that the documentary, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=664.0s)]
*  when did we invade Iraq? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=668.56s)]
*  2004? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=669.64s)]
*  Three. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  Three? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=672.68s)]
*  So the documentary at 2003 skips to like 2008. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=673.52s)]
*  They skipped like five years of the Iraqi War. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=678.4s)]
*  They skipped the entire Iraq War, invading Iraq. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=681.1999999999999s)]
*  They skipped the bad parts. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=685.12s)]
*  And they don't talk, well, they briefly covered [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=686.1600000000001s)]
*  the pushback that the United States got [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=688.5600000000001s)]

*  Briefly. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=697.36s)]
*  But where I slipped into liberalism, back into liberalism, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=698.72s)]
*  they talked about Obama. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=701.96s)]
*  That's it, point blank period. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=705.96s)]
*  They talked about. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=707.72s)]

*  under his administration and I. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=715.64s)]

*  And that's what I'm saying. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=721.24s)]
*  And that's what we need in this country, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=726.0s)]
*  is not necessarily Obama, but we need somebody like him [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=727.68s)]
*  that has some good policies. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=730.56s)]

*  Well, Israel's part of it, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1566.5s)]

*  okay, we did it. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1589.46s)]

*  He needs to control here, settle down, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1659.5s)]
*  have the economy go up, open doors again. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1662.02s)]

*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1671.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1672.78s)]
*  I don't know if Trump thinks about anybody else [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1673.62s)]
*  other than himself, but you know. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1675.18s)]
*  He says he, he's a politician, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1678.3s)]
*  he says he cares about others, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1680.18s)]
*  but he just cares about himself. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1681.5s)]
*  I think kicking them out is actually gonna [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1685.14s)]
*  have the opposite effect on the economy. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1686.94s)]

*  all the people that are here right now, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1691.3s)]
*  if they don't have a criminal record, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1692.66s)]

*  working and stuff like that. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1697.18s)]

*  Yeah, right? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1700.9s)]

*  So that's one of the things that I vehemently disagree [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1705.1000000000001s)]
*  with Trump on is that he- [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1708.7s)]
*  Wait, is this the spot? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1712.1000000000001s)]

*  So instead of kicking them out, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1724.7s)]
*  you think it'd be better if someone was presenting [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1725.7s)]
*  the alternative that they should get amnesty [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1727.74s)]

*  or anything like that, for sure. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1733.18s)]

*  I came as a refugee, so I got the password faster. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=1747.82s)]

*  a bunch of Spud Shots all over the country. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2691.42s)]

*  The rest is history. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2706.42s)]
*  Now he's driving a Ferrari. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2707.58s)]
*  You're a DJ? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2708.42s)]

*  Maybe we should have boomed it. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2731.7s)]
*  That's what I was thinking. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2732.9s)]

*  their opening shop with us is very sick. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2758.94s)]
*  This feels like a park site. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2761.2999999999997s)]
*  No reservations. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2763.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2764.34s)]
*  You gotta do a voiceover underneath this. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2766.82s)]
*  You gotta be like, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2770.02s)]

*  Kumpir. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2778.54s)]

*  No, I have one car, but I'm saying, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2785.5s)]
*  I took the risk instead of making my car better. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2788.22s)]
*  Oh yeah, okay. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2789.82s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2793.86s)]
*  He spent his last 500 dollars. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2795.18s)]
*  Last 500 dollars. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2796.38s)]
*  And he, instead of buying, making the car payment, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2797.82s)]
*  he opened the shop out of a tent. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2800.78s)]
*  And then, I said, did they repossess the car? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2803.34s)]
*  No, but he made the payment eventually. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2806.3s)]
*  That's sweet. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2808.26s)]

*  Sometimes the tent would have real long lines. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2811.3s)]
*  Sometimes people were waiting an hour for the spud. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2814.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I've said this before, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=2817.7400000000002s)]

*  I feel like Miss Villanova could tune in. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=4100.26s)]
*  But like, yeah. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=4102.5s)]
*  And then I became rat. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=4103.54s)]
*  Cause the guy that was rat was like your rat now. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=4104.86s)]
*  And it was just everything, the rest is history. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=4107.66s)]

*  Give me another bite, I'm so hungry. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=4120.62s)]
*  And then I'll give you a little piece. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=4122.34s)]
*  So the rat passed it down to you. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=4126.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70grC2k_qY&t=4128.219999999999s)]
