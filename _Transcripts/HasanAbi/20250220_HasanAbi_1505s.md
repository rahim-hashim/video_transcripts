# Hasan Interviews Chris About Mass Layoffs In The U.S. Government
**HasanAbi:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44)
*  the probationary targets is basically. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=0.0s)]
*  There's little to no regulatory requirement for [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=3.12s)]
*  justifying the termination of a probationary employee, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  although some of us do have some experience in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=8.16s)]
*  fighting probationary terminations. It's not totally. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=11.28s)]
*  What is it? What is a probationary employee for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=13.72s)]
*  the people that might not know? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=16.96s)]
*  Yeah, the first year of anyone's federal employment. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=19.68s)]
*  Alright, and I can hear you. This is perfect. No, no [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=23.48s)]
*  production issues was so. How would you like me to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=28.32s)]
*  refer to you? How would you describe who you are and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=33.2s)]
*  what you do to my audience? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=38.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a few things. I'm the president of my local [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  I have PT Local 98. I'm one of the national member of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=44.8s)]
*  the National Steering Committee of the fun. The [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=49.68s)]
*  And as a federal worker, I work at the Army Corps of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=53.04s)]
*  Engineers, but I have to be careful to disclaim that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=55.56s)]
*  nothing I say is necessarily the views of the Army [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=58.88s)]
*  Corps of Engineers. Got it. Alright, Chris, I wish I [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=61.84s)]
*  could have you here on better circumstances. But [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  unfortunately, there's a lot of issues going on [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=69.08s)]
*  specifically with mass layoffs. So without further [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=71.32s)]
*  ado, once again, thank you so much for coming on, but [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=73.84s)]
*  let's talk about it. You've been you've been doing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=77.64s)]
*  some of the rounds in media and talking about some [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=80.44s)]
*  of these issues. But what is your assessment on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=82.56s)]
*  what's happening right now with the Trump [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=85.32s)]
*  administration as they basically dismantled the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=86.84s)]
*  federal government and actively lay off tens of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=89.72s)]
*  thousands of workers? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=93.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's totally surreal. I happen to be, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  you know, in a position to not only see it up close [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=98.88s)]
*  because I'm a federal worker, but I spent the last [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  few years trying to strengthen the federal labor [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=104.68s)]
*  movement with a lot of other people. There's, I mean, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=107.44s)]
*  it's the one source of hope I have is the people that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=112.2s)]
*  I work with and have been working with the last few [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=114.28s)]
*  years in what we call the fun, which my joke was [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=116.16s)]
*  named in less serious times. Two years ago, we [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  started the Federal Unionist Network just to try to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=122.72s)]
*  build some pressure on Chuck Schumer to get Joe [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=125.8s)]
*  Biden's nominees to the Federal Labor Relations [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=129.0s)]
*  Authority passed. But little did we know we were [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=131.12s)]
*  actually laying the groundwork for and preparing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=134.0s)]
*  for, you know, I don't think it can be overstated, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=136.36s)]
*  totally historic assault on, you know, I don't want [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=140.0s)]
*  to sound too much like a lib, but you know, the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=144.52s)]
*  democracy itself is funny. A year ago, they were [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=146.44000000000003s)]
*  warning about the assault on democracy. And now [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  those same people are some of the most quiet and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=151.24s)]
*  paralyzed by the moment. But the truth is the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=154.24s)]
*  attack on the civil service, the attack on all of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  the services that our government provides really [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=158.84s)]
*  does constitute an attack on democracy. And it [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=163.4s)]
*  really can't be overstated. So yeah, that's how I [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  see it. There's a lot to say about what we're [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=170.28s)]
*  doing to try to fight it. But unfortunately, we're [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=172.08s)]
*  starting a little later than I'd like to have. But [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=174.6s)]
*  here we are. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  So there was a day of national day of action [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=178.4s)]
*  yesterday. And could you quickly go over what some [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=180.72s)]
*  of your demands were and what you guys did? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=184.68s)]
*  Yeah. So the day of action was called less than two [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=187.96s)]
*  weeks ago. We just, you know, within a week of the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=191.56s)]
*  inauguration, it became very clear that he was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=194.84s)]
*  going to go even harder and faster than anybody [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=197.56s)]
*  really expected. And so we being a relatively small [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=199.56s)]
*  formation growing really quickly, we made the call [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=205.56s)]
*  to organize a day of action, something we've [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  never done. The fund has done some like webinars, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=211.6s)]
*  we've done educational stuff for each other. The [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=214.4s)]
*  network originated as a bunch of us local officers. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=217.96s)]
*  I'm the president of my local a bunch of us [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=221.44s)]
*  presidents who are kind of frustrated with the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=223.44s)]
*  state of the labor movement had started working [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=226.72s)]
*  together. But in the last few weeks, we realized [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=229.92s)]
*  even though we're small, even though we don't have, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=234.56s)]
*  you know, the the depth of the resources that we'd [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=237.28s)]
*  like to have right now, somebody had to take a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=239.44s)]
*  stand. And we figured that if we did, maybe we [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=242.2s)]
*  could attract towards us. The federal workers who [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=245.88s)]
*  were looking for the how to get involved in the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=249.08s)]
*  fight, but also the broader public sympathies that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=250.68s)]
*  we're looking for some organization to direct it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=254.12s)]
*  towards. And I think we were right on both [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=256.2s)]
*  counts. I mean, there's been a huge influx of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=257.56s)]
*  support, not only from the broader public, but [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=259.48s)]
*  most importantly, to me, federal workers are [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=262.04s)]
*  coming towards us in droves. And yeah, so the day [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=264.16s)]
*  of action was themed around the slogan SOS, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=267.88s)]
*  right, the save our services, but SOS being [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=271.16s)]
*  obviously a distress signal to the broader public. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=274.0s)]
*  Because, you know, while they're framing it, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=277.4s)]
*  right, Elon Musk is framing it as efficiency and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=279.08s)]
*  fixing the federal workforce. Really, it has [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=281.68s)]
*  little to nothing to do with that. It's about [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=284.24s)]
*  attacking the services that protect the public [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=286.8s)]
*  from predatory lenders. And, you know, it's about [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=289.12s)]
*  protecting the socialized health care that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=292.92s)]
*  veterans benefit from the Veterans [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=294.64s)]
*  Administration, so many services protecting our [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=296.76s)]
*  environment. They're really going after the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  entire regulatory state and anything that stands in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  the way of their pursuit of more profit. And the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=303.44s)]
*  day of action was really successful. I think [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=306.08s)]
*  there were 35 or 40 cities where we had actions, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  some of them like in New York, where I am, were [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=311.44s)]
*  really big. We had more than 1000 people. And I [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=313.0s)]
*  think it was the first necessary escalatory step [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  as we build towards what will be the necessary [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=318.84s)]
*  forces to actually stop them, which ultimately, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=321.96s)]
*  it's going to have to be a lot of power we build. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=323.84s)]
*  And we're looking to the broader public sector [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=325.88s)]
*  labor movement, the broader labor movement, the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=327.4s)]
*  broader public really, I think, has to step into [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=329.56s)]
*  the streets with us and be able to stop them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=331.52s)]
*  Yeah. Can you go over at least some of the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  anecdotes that you have in terms of like, what [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=338.04s)]
*  kind of immediate issues will arise from federal [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  workers being laid off in this unceremonious [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  manner in a very swift manner? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=350.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I think we're just [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=352.04s)]
*  seeing the beginning of it, right? They're going [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=354.36s)]
*  after the easiest targets, the probationary [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=355.68s)]
*  targets is basically, there's little to no [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=357.36s)]
*  regulatory requirement for justifying the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=361.6s)]
*  termination of a probationary employee, although [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  some of us do have some experience in fighting [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=366.68s)]
*  probationary terminations. It's not totally [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=368.76000000000005s)]
*  What is it? What is a probationary employee? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=370.48s)]
*  For the people that might not know? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=373.68s)]
*  Yeah, the first year of anyone's federal [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=376.32000000000005s)]
*  employment, sometimes it's two years depends on [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=379.44s)]
*  when you were hired which agency but point is the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=382.16s)]
*  first year typically, of your employment in the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=384.56s)]
*  federal government, you are probationary. And [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=387.04s)]
*  what that means is, your boss can fire you for [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=389.4s)]
*  any reason in that first year. Now, they are [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  required to state what that reason is. And that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=395.84s)]
*  reason has to be based in some fact. I say that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=397.84s)]
*  because the basis of these mass probationary [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=401.32s)]
*  terminations are likely counter to those [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=404.2s)]
*  regulations. But a probationary employee is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=406.64s)]
*  basically anybody who's new enough that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  management reserves the right to fire you. And [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=410.67999999999995s)]
*  it's important like when you hit that 366th day, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  and you're done with your one year, now you now a [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=416.12s)]
*  bunch more protections kick in that you didn't [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=417.92s)]
*  have otherwise. It's worth noting that most [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  probationary, I don't know about most, but a lot [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=422.36s)]
*  of probationary employees are not early career. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=424.36s)]
*  Some are, of course, but many are extremely high [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=427.56s)]
*  value experienced folks who came out of the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=431.56s)]
*  private sector, maybe some other public sector [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=434.48s)]
*  service. I spent seven and a half years working [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  as a dredging, as a dredger. I worked for a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=439.6s)]
*  dredging contractor. And I got hired by the Army [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  Corps of Engineers because I carried a ton of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  dredging subject matter expertise. So there's [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=447.12s)]
*  this idea that all they're just letting off the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=449.6s)]
*  most inexperienced people. And it's just really [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=451.32s)]
*  not true. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=453.64s)]
*  People, someone mentioned saying probationary [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=456.36s)]
*  employees are not at will. And there is some [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=458.2s)]
*  confusion on that. So they're still they can [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  still be fired. Or at least like obviously, the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=464.0s)]
*  mass layoffs imply that there wasn't [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=466.56s)]
*  automatically a performance based reason for [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=469.4s)]
*  their firing, which is what they were saying they [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=473.52s)]
*  were firing all the probationary employees for. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=475.48s)]
*  Right. But what are the odds in terms of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=478.16s)]
*  virtually every single probationary employee [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=482.16s)]
*  having performance complications? Right. So [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=485.08000000000004s)]
*  that there is a this still is is illegal, I [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=487.32s)]
*  suspect. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=492.0s)]
*  I mean, the regs say and I only know this because [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  we recently were in the middle of a fight for a [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  probationary termination earlier this year, where [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=498.44s)]
*  the supervisor terminated the employee and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=501.68s)]
*  everything they asserted in the letter of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=505.68s)]
*  termination was just not true. And so as we dug [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=508.12s)]
*  into it, and I consulted the lawyers, you know, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=512.36s)]
*  what we realized was, well, the regulations [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=514.96s)]
*  require and I think this is government wide, it [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=517.2s)]
*  might just be to those of us in the Department of [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=519.52s)]
*  Defense, but basically requires that there must [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=521.16s)]
*  be a reason. And implicit is that reason must be [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=524.92s)]
*  based in fact. So if the assertion is that it's a [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=528.68s)]
*  performance problem, but a recent performance [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=532.3599999999999s)]
*  evaluation and all available records indicate [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=535.0s)]
*  that this person was did not have any performance [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=537.7199999999999s)]
*  problems, then they've been terminated for a [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=539.8s)]
*  false reason. And on those grounds can be [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=543.2399999999999s)]
*  disputed. So it's not actually an interesting [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=545.92s)]
*  anecdote. Last night, actually, if folks happened [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=549.52s)]
*  to have a feeling your overlap, your viewership [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=552.12s)]
*  probably doesn't overlap a ton with MSNBC. But if [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=554.52s)]
*  anybody caught the interview I did on MSNBC [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=556.56s)]
*  last night, the guy I was with had just been [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=559.8s)]
*  terminated like two days ago now. And what he [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=563.4s)]
*  described was he and everybody else who was [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=566.68s)]
*  terminated, all the probationary employees who [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=569.04s)]
*  were terminated at the he worked at the Consumer [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=570.8s)]
*  Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB. And he and all [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=572.68s)]
*  of his fellow probationary employees got the same [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=577.0799999999999s)]
*  exact email. And they didn't do the mail merger [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=579.52s)]
*  right? What are the exactly they all had exactly [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=583.88s)]
*  the same performance problems. But they didn't do [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=588.72s)]
*  the mail merger right. So it said like dear, first [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=592.08s)]
*  name, last name, literally said dear, first name, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=594.8s)]
*  last name, and then proceeded to explain how [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=597.2s)]
*  your performance indicates that you know, we have [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=599.36s)]
*  to let you go or whatever. I mean, it's very [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=602.4s)]
*  clearly not the spirit of, you know, probationary [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=604.4s)]
*  probation is supposed to be a time to assess [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=609.4s)]
*  whether or not this person is right for federal [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=611.32s)]
*  service. And that's clearly what they're doing. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=613.0s)]
*  Can we briefly talk about one of the other like [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=615.6s)]
*  existing long term issues that that that virtually [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=618.24s)]
*  exists in all private and public sector jobs in [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=622.24s)]
*  general, which is the problem with understaffing, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=625.24s)]
*  at least in my experience covering labor issues [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=628.36s)]
*  with regular frequency. One of the things that [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=631.64s)]
*  most people actually strike over is understaffing [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=634.56s)]
*  and the like the nurses union immediately comes [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=640.56s)]
*  to mind like so consistently, no matter where [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=643.52s)]
*  they are in the world, even under the National [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=646.48s)]
*  Healthcare Service in the UK, or many different [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=648.24s)]
*  private networks here in the United States of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  America. Nurses are constantly complaining about [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=653.8s)]
*  understandably complaining about understaffing. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  And I feel like this is a problem that persists in [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=660.64s)]
*  the federal regulatory ages in the federal [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=664.16s)]
*  government as well. So mass layoffs of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=667.16s)]
*  probationary workers across the board is obviously [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=671.9599999999999s)]
*  not only technically not legal, but also is coming [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=675.92s)]
*  at a time when we need more workers, not less. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=681.6s)]
*  So this is this is one of the this is one of the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=685.9599999999999s)]
*  very foreseeable problems I think that the Trump [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=690.04s)]
*  administration is bringing about. You have [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=692.76s)]
*  planes falling out of the sky. You have air [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=696.9200000000001s)]
*  traffic control towers that are understaffed. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  You got three guys sometimes doing the work of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=702.9200000000001s)]
*  10 people or even 30 people. And they're not [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=706.0s)]
*  going to be able to they're not going to be able [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  to produce the same work. And I think regulation [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=712.72s)]
*  and safety related issues especially require [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  everyone in the workforce to be both competent [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=719.88s)]
*  and not over exploited for this reason. So what [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=723.0s)]
*  do you suspect will happen in terms of these mass [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=727.04s)]
*  layoffs at a time when the federal government [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=729.64s)]
*  needs more workers, not less? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=732.24s)]
*  I mean, first, just to confirm the federal the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=733.64s)]
*  whole federal government, I can speak best, of [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=736.64s)]
*  course, to my experience, you know, at the Army [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=738.32s)]
*  Corps, but the whole federal government is [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=740.52s)]
*  understaffed. I mean, so much work. I mean, it's [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=742.56s)]
*  crazy how much we do just like I work at the New [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=745.32s)]
*  York District or the Army Corps. We do all this [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=748.48s)]
*  military construction support for the different [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=750.8s)]
*  arsenals, West Point, all these different, you [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=752.96s)]
*  know, military bases in the region, but also, you [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=755.12s)]
*  know, all the flood walls and levees, their [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=758.44s)]
*  initial construction and maintenance. And there's [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=760.88s)]
*  a bunch of studies that we do around like [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=763.24s)]
*  protecting against future hurricane Sandy type [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=765.08s)]
*  events. Like the program is massive. I think it [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=767.2s)]
*  was pushing a billion per year just this last year. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=770.2s)]
*  And our workforce is like, you know, it's probably [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=773.96s)]
*  down to 500 now. We were already having a staffing [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=776.96s)]
*  problem because the labor market's been tight. So [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=779.24s)]
*  you're totally right about the premise that it's [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=782.64s)]
*  we're understaffed as is. But what's the effect? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=785.76s)]
*  And I think they know it. They're that they don't [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=788.84s)]
*  have a problem with exacerbating the staffing [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=792.72s)]
*  crisis, because that's precisely what they're [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=795.64s)]
*  going to use to further privatize all the services [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=797.64s)]
*  that we provide. And you think you think about an [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=802.08s)]
*  agency like mine, which historically isn't [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=804.36s)]
*  primarily a contracting agency that contracts [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=807.48s)]
*  everything out the Army Corps of Engineers, you [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=810.16s)]
*  know, does its own engineering and designing and [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=812.16s)]
*  architecture. And we used to do much more of our [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=817.0s)]
*  own construction. You know, the last decades of [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=820.12s)]
*  neoliberal privatization has corresponded with a [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=822.56s)]
*  lot of the offloading of what was previously [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=825.7199999999999s)]
*  considered. What's the term? Like inherently [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=829.76s)]
*  governmental work, like the definition of [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=832.92s)]
*  inherently governmental has been getting trimmed up, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=835.12s)]
*  trimmed up, trimmed up. And now they're trying [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=836.9599999999999s)]
*  to collapse us. And I'm sure their goal is to make [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=839.68s)]
*  us exclusively a contracting agency where like [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=843.3199999999999s)]
*  project management functions, planning, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=846.24s)]
*  engineering, like all of it. They want to give out [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=848.4s)]
*  to these big A.E. firms. And you can you can figure [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=850.84s)]
*  all the corollaries at NASA and the ways that [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=853.92s)]
*  companies like SpaceX are going to benefit from [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=856.16s)]
*  understaffing turned into privatization. They'll [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=859.4399999999999s)]
*  justify the privatization on the basis of the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=861.64s)]
*  understaffing that they created by firing all the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=864.84s)]
*  probationary terminations and all that. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=867.32s)]
*  What are I feel like I feel like this also has a [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=869.36s)]
*  self-defeating cycle as well, because the less [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=875.1600000000001s)]
*  competent the government seem easier it is for [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=878.8000000000001s)]
*  people to advocate for more tax cuts because they [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=882.2800000000001s)]
*  just simply don't see any of the benefits. Many of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=886.72s)]
*  the benefits are obviously invisible in general. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=889.6s)]
*  But I mean, this is one of those aspects. I was [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=892.24s)]
*  like very much a necessity like building a dam or [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=895.3199999999999s)]
*  a levee, I think is that's it. That's like the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=899.88s)]
*  and maintaining it is probably one of the more [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=902.48s)]
*  most important things you you can do. So where [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=906.0s)]
*  like where do you see all of this going? I guess. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=911.8399999999999s)]
*  Now, it's such a good point. My one of my main [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=914.88s)]
*  collaborators in the Federal Unionist Network made [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=918.16s)]
*  this point last week on one of the interviews she [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=920.36s)]
*  did, which is like our work is vindicated precisely [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=923.04s)]
*  by its invisibility. It's the fact that you didn't [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=927.3199999999999s)]
*  get sick from that water you drank and that food [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=930.0799999999999s)]
*  that you ate and the air that you breathed and the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=932.4s)]
*  flood that didn't happen. It's all it's the absence [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=935.3199999999999s)]
*  of news stories that vindicates the work that we [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=937.8s)]
*  do. And so it's going to be really important that [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=940.28s)]
*  we get good at messaging these next few weeks and [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=946.4s)]
*  months because the attack is only going to [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=949.3199999999999s)]
*  continue. Right. They're starting with probationary [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=951.28s)]
*  hires. They're going to pursue much deeper cuts. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=953.76s)]
*  And I think what we have to remind folks is and [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=957.8s)]
*  really ask folks like I think everybody has an [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=960.48s)]
*  obligation to look at where the things that they [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=962.88s)]
*  benefit from come from. So if a member of your [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=967.0799999999999s)]
*  family has a home health aid, chances are that [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=970.68s)]
*  service is one way or another subsidized by [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=974.76s)]
*  federal dollars. If your kid's class size is kept [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=978.28s)]
*  under a certain unreasonable threshold, you know, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=984.04s)]
*  30 or 25 or whatever is the standards now, that's [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=987.2s)]
*  informed by money subsidized through the [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=991.64s)]
*  Department of Education to local cities and states. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=994.12s)]
*  I think we obviously as federal workers, I can [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=997.84s)]
*  describe how what I do matters. And you know, the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1001.12s)]
*  news stories that don't happen because dredging [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1003.44s)]
*  happens. You know, the entire economy depends on [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1005.92s)]
*  keeping, you know, sediment from accruing in the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1009.04s)]
*  shipping channels that allow goods to come in and [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1012.64s)]
*  out of all the ports. Right. I can describe I [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1014.76s)]
*  think we need the broader public who supports us, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1017.24s)]
*  who sees the crisis to help us share the narrative [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1020.36s)]
*  and be like whether it's the health care that you [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1022.92s)]
*  you as a veteran receive, which is like some of the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1025.8799999999999s)]
*  best social. People always talk about how, you [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1028.68s)]
*  know, Canada or Europe, they've got such great [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1031.48s)]
*  socialized health care as if we don't have one of [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1033.92s)]
*  the best socialized health care systems in the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1035.96s)]
*  world. Granted, it's not for the entire population, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1039.0800000000002s)]
*  but veterans receive some of the best health care [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1041.96s)]
*  in the world. And it's totally socialized in the [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1045.52s)]
*  right. Sees it as this ripe fruit for picking a [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1047.4s)]
*  part and, you know, making for profit. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1052.4s)]
*  Yeah, like the rest of us. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1054.96s)]
*  They've actively tried to dismantle VA and also [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1056.28s)]
*  privatize it and have seen some success in recent [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1058.92s)]
*  years in terms of privatization. A big problem [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1061.56s)]
*  with the with the VA, however, is that its pool [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1065.6799999999998s)]
*  of like its pool of people that are in the VA are [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1070.2s)]
*  unlike any other health care pool at all. It's [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1076.56s)]
*  constantly growing and also virtually every single [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1079.9199999999998s)]
*  person needs it like they need higher level care [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1083.56s)]
*  than the average person that you can normally hedge [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1088.12s)]
*  against as just just how insurance works. You have [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1090.84s)]
*  everyone buy into it and the healthy are supposed to [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1094.52s)]
*  subsidize those who desperately need it. Of course, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1097.6399999999999s)]
*  there would be no need for a VA if we had universal [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1102.56s)]
*  health care. But yes, Republicans are also actively [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1104.9199999999998s)]
*  and some Democrats even are actively working to [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1109.04s)]
*  dismantle the VA and privatize that as well. So I [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1111.52s)]
*  guess one last question. And thank you so much, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1118.08s)]
*  for coming on and taking the time out of your day. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1120.8s)]
*  One last question I have is, is what would you rate [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1125.56s)]
*  the Democratic Party right now and their and their [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1128.52s)]
*  competence against all of all the things that are [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1132.36s)]
*  happening? Do you feel like they're you feel like [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1135.0s)]
*  they're mounting any defense whatsoever or even I [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1137.72s)]
*  mean, a significant one? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1140.44s)]
*  I mean, I think the answer is pretty clearly no, not [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1143.6s)]
*  yet. But I think it's important to say not yet. I [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1145.6399999999999s)]
*  don't want to, you know, we need them to get off [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1148.48s)]
*  their asses. The first one for all the media stuff [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1155.0400000000002s)]
*  I've done and you know, I'm an engineer and yeah, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1156.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm a union leader. So I have some experience doing [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1158.76s)]
*  public stuff a little bit like this is unprecedented. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1160.52s)]
*  Right. I mean, the first media thing I did was with [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1162.8400000000001s)]
*  an interview with somebody at the New York Times [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1166.5600000000002s)]
*  asked me a bunch of questions. And the one piece [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1168.3600000000001s)]
*  that they kept was that I'm I'm a constituent of [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1170.0800000000002s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries. I live in Brooklyn. And Hakeem [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1175.2800000000002s)]
*  Jeffries is my rep. And he had just like a couple [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1177.64s)]
*  days prior did that thing where he said, you know, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1180.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know if he physically threw his hands in [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1183.0400000000002s)]
*  the air, but he basically figuratively threw his [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1184.4s)]
*  hands in the air and said, it's their government. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1186.16s)]
*  There's nothing we can do. And I think that's been [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1189.44s)]
*  the lead. You know, the paralysis that you see in [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1192.4s)]
*  the Democratic Party has been set from its [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1195.96s)]
*  leadership. And so for them, I think we have to [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1198.2s)]
*  give them a big fat F for their conduct so far. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1202.0s)]
*  Obviously, there are some great exceptions. I mean, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1205.44s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib came out to the Federal Unionist [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1207.68s)]
*  Network indoor rally we did at Busboys and Poets [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1212.24s)]
*  in D.C. last week. AOC came out last night to the [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1215.12s)]
*  rally we did. So like the left, the squad are [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1218.6399999999999s)]
*  showing up. And the thing is, we're not going to [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1221.68s)]
*  win if it's just them. We're going to have to [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1224.32s)]
*  figure out others. And there are some other more, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1225.96s)]
*  you know, liberal mainstream dems. I mean, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1227.72s)]
*  Pritzker, like I can't believe I'm going to say [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1231.56s)]
*  anything good about Pritzker, but like [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1234.24s)]
*  Governor of Illinois declaring like the severity [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1236.16s)]
*  of the crisis at the moment. Like, yeah, we need [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1240.4s)]
*  people to actually we need them to move beyond [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1243.0800000000002s)]
*  the rhetoric, though, for those who aren't even [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1245.52s)]
*  reaching the rhetoric. We need them to find it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1247.52s)]
*  And for those who are willing to throw around [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1249.2s)]
*  the rhetoric, we're going to need them to [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1251.96s)]
*  actually embolden, you know, forces into the [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1253.04s)]
*  streets. I mean, we are putting out a call. The [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1257.28s)]
*  S.O.S. distress signal is targeted at the public, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1259.48s)]
*  but with a strategic focus on public sector [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1262.72s)]
*  unions. So our hope is that political leaders, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1264.96s)]
*  but perhaps most importantly, union leaders who [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1267.72s)]
*  have a relatively recent history of militancy at [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1270.48s)]
*  the public level, at the city and state level of [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1273.04s)]
*  public unions, we need them to, you know, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1274.96s)]
*  remember that muscle memory and be willing to go [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1277.3999999999999s)]
*  back out into the streets, you know, jointly with [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1280.24s)]
*  us as federal workers. And, you know, Trump and [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1282.52s)]
*  Musk, they know they're creating a political [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1285.9199999999998s)]
*  crisis. They think they can manage it. Our job, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1288.04s)]
*  the labor movement's job is to make it [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1291.32s)]
*  unmanageable. And I think that's only going to [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1293.24s)]
*  happen through unprecedented political [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1295.12s)]
*  mobilizations. And if ever there was a time for [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1297.96s)]
*  it, it's now. And yeah, that's what we're [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1300.48s)]
*  that's what we're hoping to inspire over the [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1302.76s)]
*  weeks and months ahead. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1304.32s)]
*  And what can members of my community do to help [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1305.48s)]
*  in this struggle? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1310.28s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate that question. The comms folks [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1312.52s)]
*  wouldn't let me regret or let me live it down if [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1315.3999999999999s)]
*  I didn't say it. A few things. One is if you're [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1318.48s)]
*  a federal worker, which, you know, some some of [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1320.56s)]
*  your listeners may be. Yeah. Yeah. Join the fun. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1322.76s)]
*  The Federal Unionist Network is for you, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1328.24s)]
*  ultimately. I mean, obviously, we have a [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1331.56s)]
*  broader mission right now. But we get our power, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1333.08s)]
*  our strength from the federal workforce that's [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1336.32s)]
*  coming into our ranks. And I'll say it a couple [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1339.28s)]
*  times. The website for everybody to go to is [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1342.76s)]
*  go.savepublicservices.com. If you're a federal [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1345.56s)]
*  worker, there's a box to check to say you are and [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1350.52s)]
*  we'll follow up to learn more details what your [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1352.56s)]
*  union is, all that stuff. But so for federal [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1354.8799999999999s)]
*  workers, join the fun, get involved. If you're not [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1357.16s)]
*  a member of your union, obviously join it. If you [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1359.36s)]
*  don't have a union, you can form one. In fact, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1361.36s)]
*  we're working really closely. The Emergency [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1363.68s)]
*  Workplace Organizing Committee, one of the most [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1365.6399999999999s)]
*  important formations of the last few years, they [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1367.32s)]
*  do new organizing and fun and Ewok are teamed up [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1369.72s)]
*  now to help organize new federal unions because, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1372.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, despite that we are high density in the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1377.16s)]
*  federal sector, there's still hundreds of [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1379.0s)]
*  thousands of union eligible folks who don't have [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1381.16s)]
*  a union. If you're not a federal worker, you can [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1383.88s)]
*  still help, I think, by sharing your stories. And [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1388.0s)]
*  like I said before, understand like you and your [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1391.08s)]
*  community, how you benefit from federal services [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1394.16s)]
*  and find any opportunity to share that. Because I [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1397.48s)]
*  think the invisibility of the federal services is [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1399.44s)]
*  part of our problem. We need to we need everybody [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1401.68s)]
*  to help shape, reshape the narrative about how [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1403.88s)]
*  federal service actually connects, you know, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1406.0s)]
*  whether it's labor rights that are protected by [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1407.92s)]
*  the NLRA or its environmental protections that [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1409.48s)]
*  are upheld by the Environmental Protection [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1412.1200000000001s)]
*  Agency. Those are important. I gave you the URL. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1414.8400000000001s)]
*  I'll give it again. Go.savepublicservices.com. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1418.48s)]
*  And, you know, the regular stuff around contacting [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1422.6000000000001s)]
*  your representatives, I think it's still important [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1425.5600000000002s)]
*  and perhaps perhaps is more important as somebody [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1427.8000000000002s)]
*  who generally like has put their political [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1429.8000000000002s)]
*  attention to the union work and building a strong [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1432.0s)]
*  union. And I've always kind of like, sure, contact [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1434.0800000000002s)]
*  your representatives, too. Now, it actually feels [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1437.0s)]
*  like we can make a difference in the political [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1439.6s)]
*  calculus of elected representatives because the [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1443.16s)]
*  crisis is so severe and because so many of them [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1445.64s)]
*  are paralyzed by the moment. I actually think that [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1448.32s)]
*  the pressure pushing, you know, those otherwise [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1451.24s)]
*  confused electeds who don't know who they're going [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1454.68s)]
*  to piss off by taking this or that action. I think [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1457.28s)]
*  they're actually really subject to pressure. So if [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1459.4s)]
*  you can push your electeds to actually do [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1462.0s)]
*  something meaningful to support whatever [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1464.24s)]
*  mobilizations are happening in your community. I [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1466.28s)]
*  actually I'm less cynical about that as like a [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1468.56s)]
*  necessary tactic right now than I may may have been [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1471.04s)]
*  in traditional times. But these are not traditional [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1473.6s)]
*  times. So call your representatives. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1476.08s)]
*  All right. Perfect. Thank you so much for coming on. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1477.72s)]
*  And good luck to all of your future endeavors. And [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1482.08s)]
*  we'll try to really appreciate the chance. Yeah, of [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1486.6399999999999s)]
*  course, we'll try to help out as much as we can over [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1488.84s)]
*  here. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1491.52s)]

*  Appreciate the opportunity. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05o8SJwDP44&t=1496.32s)]
