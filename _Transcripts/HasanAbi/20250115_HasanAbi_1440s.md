# President Biden's Farewell | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k)
*  literally looks like a photograph that you would put in memoriam, except you wouldn't even do that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=0.0s)]
*  because like he looks kind of sad here too. The courage to stand up for the rights of our [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=4.16s)]
*  democracy is espoused after centuries of respect in the institutions that govern our society. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=9.36s)]
*  And speaking independence and liberty for generations to come. If you were moved by this [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=13.68s)]
*  speech, you have to go to an old folks home. It doesn't matter how old you are. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=18.48s)]
*  Biden's final address to the nation is live. Oh God, the elements of which I laid out in great [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  detail in May of this year. This plan was developed and negotiated by my team and will be [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=28.08s)]
*  largely implemented by the incoming administration. That's why I told my team to keep the incoming [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=35.68s)]
*  administration fully informed because that's how it should be working together as Americans. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  This will be my final address to you from the American people from the Oval Office, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  from this desk as president. And I've been thinking a lot about who we are and maybe [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=53.12s)]
*  more importantly, who we should be. Long ago in New York Harbor, an iron worker installed [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  beam after beam, day after day. He was joined by steel workers, stonemasons, engineers. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=66.64s)]
*  They built not just a single structure, but a beacon of freedom. The very idea of America was [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=74.24s)]
*  so big, we felt the entire world needed to see the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France after [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=81.12s)]
*  our Civil War. Like the very idea of America, it was built not by one person, but by many people [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  from every background. Like America, the Statue of Liberty is not standing still. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  Her foot literally steps forward atop a broken chain of human bondage. She's on the march [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  and she literally moves. She was built to sway back and forth to withstand the fury of stormy [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=110.88s)]
*  weather, to stand the test of time because storms are always coming. She sways a few inches, but she [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=117.36s)]
*  never falls into the current below. An engineering marvel. The Statue of Liberty is also an enduring [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=124.4s)]
*  symbol of the soul of our nation. A soul shaped by forces that bring us together and by forces that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=131.28s)]
*  pull us apart. And yet through good times and tough times, we've astute at all. A nation of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=137.76s)]
*  pioneers and explorers, of dreamers and doers, of ancestors native to this land, of ancestors [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=145.28s)]
*  who came by force. A nation of immigrants came to build a better life. A nation holding the torch of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  the most powerful idea ever in the history of the world. That all of us, all of us are created equal. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=161.76s)]
*  That all of us deserve to be treated with dignity, justice and fairness. That democracy [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  must defend and be defined and be imposed, moved in every way possible. Our rights, our freedoms, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=177.12s)]
*  our dreams. But we know the idea of America, our institution, our people, our values that uphold it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=188.0s)]
*  You know, when speech writers were just like, dude, come on, it's your final farewell address. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=196.16s)]
*  They really did not put a lot of emphasis in this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=202.48s)]
*  Whether we lead by the example of our power or the power of our example, whether we show the courage [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=204.16s)]
*  to stand up to the abuse of power or we yield to it, after 50 years at the center of all of this, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=210.32s)]
*  I know that believing in the idea of America means respecting the institution that is [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=218.16s)]
*  governed a free society. The presidency, the Congress, the courts, a free and independent press. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=223.84s)]
*  Institutions that are rooted, they just might not reflect the timeless words, but they echo [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=234.0s)]
*  the words of the Declaration of Independence. We hold these truths to be self-evident. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=243.28s)]
*  Rooted in the timeless words of the Constitution, we the people, our system of separation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=249.28s)]
*  Americans be like China number not even two, America number one, and then this is our president. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=255.84s)]
*  We've retained our democracy for nearly 250 years. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=260.96s)]
*  This is the leader of the free world, dude. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=263.52s)]
*  Longer than any other nation in history that's ever tried such a bold experiment. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=265.92s)]
*  In the past four years, our democracy is held strong. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=269.92s)]
*  And every day I've kept my commitment to be president for all Americans. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=273.2s)]
*  Through one of the toughest periods in our nation's history, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=278.16s)]
*  I've had a great partner and Vice President Kamala Harris spend the honor of my life [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  to see the resilience of essential workers getting this through once in a century pandemic. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=287.68s)]
*  The heroism of service members, the first responders, keeping us safe, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=294.0s)]
*  the determination of advocates standing up for our rights and our freedoms. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=298.08s)]
*  Instead of losing their jobs to an economic crisis that we inherited, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=303.2s)]
*  millions of Americans now have the dignity of work. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  Millions of entrepreneurs and companies creating new businesses and industries, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=312.0s)]
*  hiring American workers, using American products. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=317.12s)]
*  Together, we've launched a new era of American possibilities. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=321.44s)]
*  One of the greatest modernizations of infrastructure in our entire history, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=325.68s)]
*  from new roads, bridges, clean water, affordable high speed Internet for every American. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=330.0s)]
*  We invented the semiconductor smaller than the tip of my little finger. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=337.12s)]
*  And now it's bringing those chip factories and those jobs back to America where they belong. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  Creating thousands of jobs. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  Finally, giving Medicare the power to make the world a better place. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=349.76s)]
*  Giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for millions of seniors. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=354.4s)]
*  And finally doing something to protect our children and our families by passing the most [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=360.88s)]
*  significant gun safety law in 30 years and bringing violent crime to a part is so funny. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=367.52s)]
*  Our sacred obligations over one. That's like Trump saying he did the most significant gun safety [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=374.48s)]
*  measures because he banned bump stocks like families. God, we're so pathetic. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=378.96s)]
*  Education benefits and more for their families. You know, it will take time to feel the full [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=384.32s)]
*  impact of all we've done together, but the seeds are planted and they'll grow and they'll bloom [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=392.56s)]
*  for decades to come at home. We've created nearly 70. I bet this stuff goes hard as [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=398.96s)]
*  for people who don't know anything. No, because they also don't like the aesthetics of an old [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=404.48s)]
*  man. So it basically has no overseas. The only people that will like what we're watching here [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=409.44s)]
*  is going to be like diehard Democratic Party operatives and loyalists. I'm so proud of how [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=417.36s)]
*  much we've accomplished for the American people. And I wish the incoming administration success [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=423.52s)]
*  because I want America to succeed. That's why I've held my duty to ensure a peaceful, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=430.08s)]
*  orderly transition of power to ensure we lead by the power of our example. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=437.2s)]
*  I have no doubt that America is in a position to continue to succeed. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=443.44s)]
*  That's why my farewell address tonight. I want to warn the country of some things that give me great [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=447.76s)]
*  concern. This is a dangerous constant and that's the dangerous concentration of power [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=453.2s)]
*  in the hands of a very few ultra wealthy people. The dangerous consequences. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=459.84s)]
*  If their abuse of power is left unchecked today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=465.52s)]
*  wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=473.28s)]
*  and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead. We see the consequences all across America [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=479.12s)]
*  and we've seen it before. More than a century ago, but the American people stood up to the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=488.16s)]
*  robber barons back then and busted the trusts. They didn't punish the wealthy, just made the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=494.88s)]
*  wealthy pay the by play by the rules everybody else had to. Workers want rights to earn their [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=502.0s)]
*  fair share. You know, they were dealt into the deal and it helped put us on a path to building [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=507.36s)]
*  the largest middle class, the most prosperous century any nation in the world has ever seen. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=514.88s)]
*  We've got to do that again. The last four years, that is exactly what we've done. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  People should be able to make as much as they can, but pay, play by the same rules, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  pay their fair share in taxes. So much is at stake. Right now, the existential threat of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=533.04s)]
*  climate change has never been clear. Just look across the country, from California to North [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=540.7199999999999s)]
*  Carolina. That's why I signed the most significant climate and clean energy law ever, ever in the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=547.8399999999999s)]
*  history of the world and the rest of the world trying to model it now. It's working, creating [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=554.48s)]
*  jobs and industries of the future. Now we've proven we don't have to choose between protecting [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=560.32s)]
*  the environment and growing the economy. We're doing both. The powerful forces want to wield [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=566.08s)]
*  their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken to tackle the climate crisis, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=573.9200000000001s)]
*  to serve their own interests for power and profit. I wonder if Biden saw Bernie's words and got sad [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=578.96s)]
*  when I interviewed him and he said some mean words about them. Our children and our grandchildren, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=585.7600000000001s)]
*  must keep pushing forward. Obviously his staffers don't show him anything negative, but [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=590.16s)]
*  there's no time to waste. It's also clear that American leadership and technology [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=594.4s)]
*  is unparalleled, an unparalleled source of innovation that can transform lives. We see [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=600.4s)]
*  the same dangers of the concentration of technology, power and wealth. You know, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=607.28s)]
*  as farewell address, President Eisenhower spoke of the dangers of the military industrial complex. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  He warned us then about, and I quote, the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=620.0s)]
*  end of quote. Six days, six decades later, I'm equally concerned about the potential rise [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=627.28s)]
*  of a tech industrial complex that could pose real dangers for our country as well. Americans are [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=643.04s)]
*  The free press is crumbling. Editors are disappearing. Social media is giving up on [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=650.56s)]
*  fact checking. The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=656.7199999999999s)]
*  We must hold the social platform accountable to protect our children, our families and our [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=664.24s)]
*  very democracy from the abuse of power. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=671.04s)]
*  most consequential technology of our time, perhaps of all time. Nothing offers more profound [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=678.64s)]
*  possibilities and risks for our economy and our security, our society and for humanity. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=685.36s)]
*  Artificial intelligence even has the potential to help us answer my call to end cancer as we know it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=694.0799999999999s)]
*  But unless safeguards are in place, AI could spawn new threats to our rights, our way of life, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  to our privacy, how we work and how we protect our nation. We must make sure AI is safe and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=706.24s)]
*  trustworthy and good for all humankind. In the age of AI, it's more important than ever that the [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqXwn0Rw6k&t=713.12s)]
