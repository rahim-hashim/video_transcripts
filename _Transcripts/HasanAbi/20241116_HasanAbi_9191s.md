*  and that freaks me out one of the weird things about fin is that [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2737.2s)]
*  It his fog his face doesn't look like a fox face so much like because [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2740.8799999999997s)]
*  When they breed them to be pets like people want shorter snouts and they want floppy ears and they want spots and they want an animal [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2745.2799999999997s)]
*  That's like not afraid of people. They they just are like breeding dogs [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2752.16s)]
*  Um, so even his face shape is different from what you usually think of when you think of a fox [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2755.7599999999998s)]

*  because of the tail [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2776.64s)]
*  Well in the summer he looks very different but thank you for noticing that he's really fluffy sure he's actually very healthy but [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2780.32s)]

*  a lot of wolves like we uh [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2957.44s)]
*  In turkish mythology like wolves very important. We're supposed to be descendant of wolves. I guess in roman mythology as well [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2959.28s)]

*  um [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2967.76s)]
*  So we have two wolf hybrids they came from a facility [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2968.72s)]
*  Uh, that's had a bunch of animal welfare act violations over the past decade [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2972.0800000000004s)]
*  So their enclosure was like a tenth of the size [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2975.44s)]
*  They just didn't have the resources to take care of them. And so they got transferred here in may of this past year, which makes them [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2977.2000000000003s)]
*  um our most recent rescue [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2982.6400000000003s)]
*  Um, so we just built this enclosure, but we don't know how much interaction they've had with people before now [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2984.96s)]
*  So they're still like super sussed out by people. This is dope. My what you're doing is awesome. Thank you [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=2990.5600000000004s)]

*  Um, yeah, this enclosure was expensive. It's a big one [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3002.0s)]
*  Um, we have the wolves to teach people so they're wolf hybrids. I keep saying that they're part dog part wolf [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3006.0s)]
*  So people breed wolves with dogs so that they can be like my dog's part wolf [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3011.1200000000003s)]
*  Do you know which like which is dumb wolves are bigger right normally like this? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3016.7200000000003s)]
*  Because these are they're big but they're not that big. Yeah, so timber the one right there [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3022.2400000000002s)]
*  That you're looking at right now, he's 40 gray wolf and then the rest of him he's malamute husky and german shepherd [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3027.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, so people want to say that their dog is part wolf or whatever [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3035.8399999999997s)]
*  But then they have an animal that a lot of times isn't safe to have in your home because they're part wolf. So they're [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3039.2799999999997s)]
*  Um a little more unpredictable. Um, and a lot of times it doesn't work out [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3044.3199999999997s)]
*  They have to be euthanized but then they also can't be released into the wild because they're part dog [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3047.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay, so then they end up in this weird limbo and facilities like this. So it's just super sad [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3050.96s)]
*  Um, these two were used as a breeding pair at the last facility that they were at [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3055.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's when you get like the florida man's been eaten by a wolf like, yeah [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3058.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3062.96s)]

*  that I used to go to back in the day that had like part wolf hybrid dogs that he would bring and it was so weird because [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3067.6s)]
*  You always got that vibe that like, you know what a dog senses you as a human like you can kind of [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3074.56s)]
*  You can kind of vibe it out [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3079.92s)]
*  The wolf dogs would not even look at the other dogs in the same way [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3081.44s)]
*  They just don't care [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3084.8s)]
*  They just they they would not look at you or the other dogs as like in the way that like other dogs interact with one another [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3085.76s)]
*  Yeah, it was very odd. I don't know. I don't know. I've never seen wolf dogs interact with other dogs. That's interesting [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3092.32s)]
*  They were really big too [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3098.7200000000003s)]
*  And I guess like, you know what? I think contributed to the problem game of thrones [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3100.64s)]

*  So the other reason we have wolves is to teach people about how important wolf dogs is to teach people about how important they are [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3297.36s)]
*  In their ecosystems, right? They're keystone species. So their whole ecosystem relies on them [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3302.72s)]
*  To survive wolves in the wild eat deer [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3308.56s)]
*  Which helps protect plant populations because deer eat plants [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3312.56s)]
*  So wolves are really important to have in the wild as well. All right, maybe he doesn't want it [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=3316.7999999999997s)]

*  She'll be full ground. So like 100 pounds 100 to 200 pounds. It's like an uncircumcised penis [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4582.12s)]
*  Well, sure no one's ever said that but [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4587.64s)]

*  There we go [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4627.88s)]
*  Okay, how does she get here? And what are the what are the reasons why she's an animal ambassador? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4629.160000000001s)]
*  Somebody got him as a thank you so much for asking somebody got him [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4634.040000000001s)]
*  Somebody got her as a pet [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4638.200000000001s)]
*  Um, and then they had to move states. She's on the move [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4639.8s)]
*  Damn she's speedy. Yeah, i've never seen a turtle fucking and they had to move states and they couldn't bring her with them [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4643.72s)]
*  Um, so so that's how she ended up here [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4650.52s)]
*  a lot of people um [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4653.4800000000005s)]
*  A lot of people think they want a tortoise as a pet but they live like 100 years [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4659.400000000001s)]
*  So it's a really hard thing to have as a pet [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4662.76s)]
*  Salchotta tortoises are endangered in the wild [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4664.92s)]
*  One of the reasons is because of the pet trade because people want them as pets so bad [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4667.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's the second reason is they're competing with cattle on their native grasslands [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4670.76s)]
*  Um, so we were just putting cows everywhere to keep up with the beef industry and they're being out competed in their homes by cows [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4675.56s)]
*  So you're saying weaning in her they're they're not vibing right there. So another reason to eat less beef if you can [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4681.8s)]
*  Um push pop is target trained by the way, he wants to do something cool. What what do you mean? Yeah, she's [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4688.68s)]
*  Target trained already [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4694.92s)]
*  Okay, she's like give me the rest [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4697.64s)]
*  So we hide this bite it good job [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4701.320000000001s)]
*  Here wait, i'll show you i'm gonna i'm gonna turn it. She's she might she might need a bev [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4704.4400000000005s)]
*  She went hey target [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4709.320000000001s)]
*  Good [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=4714.280000000001s)]

*  male [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6594.12s)]
*  however [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6595.08s)]
*  One of those males will then subsequently end up impregnating her and then the entire nest of the babies is female [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6596.280000000001s)]
*  Right. Did I say that right? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6602.4400000000005s)]

*  Um if they get really scared [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6681.64s)]
*  They can expel air on it really fast. Yeah, so they have beneficial mites. They clean them up [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6683.72s)]
*  They can't do anything to you. What's the what the air do like that? They [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6688.2s)]
*  What do they do for their environment? Yeah, um, they're detritivore as well. So they break down organic matter [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6692.599999999999s)]
*  And make soils that we can use to grow things so people don't like cockroaches because they think of dirty places right when they think of roaches [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6698.76s)]
*  Roaches are in dirty places to recycle that material to break it down [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6705.96s)]
*  So they are in dirty places. So their nature's little janitors. I was about to say what's the roaches recycling? [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6711.16s)]
*  They're fine. Go ahead [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6719.08s)]
*  Firefighter. Yeah being upset at roaches for being in a dirty place is like being mad at a firefighter for being at the site of a fire [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6721.3s)]
*  They're not the ones that cause the dirty place. They're there to clean up [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6728.84s)]
*  The decaying matter i'm not gonna lie a firefighter looked this scary. I wouldn't like the firefighters either [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6732.68s)]
*  This is why I had the vest on [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6739.4s)]

*  Those are his eyes. Oh, they are okay right there. Oh, no, I thought the top I thought the top ones were no [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6756.28s)]
*  No, those aren't his eyes [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6761.08s)]
*  That's how you can tell it's male though is they have pretty prominent horns [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6762.5199999999995s)]
*  Um guys, you don't have to love bugs, but you have to know why they're important if we didn't have any bugs we would all die [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6765.96s)]
*  die [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6772.839999999999s)]
*  Damn, I mean [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6775.0s)]
*  I mean, but if we get nuked though, like they survive, right? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6776.679999999999s)]
*  So they could not survive like a nuclear explosion, but they can withstand like 10 times the radiation that we can [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6780.12s)]
*  I'm willing to risk it. Okay die. How do they make um [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6789.88s)]
*  I think that they have penetrative sex [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6796.04s)]
*  Really? Yeah, but i'm not sure what their genitalia looks like [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6800.599999999999s)]
*  No, but look, yeah [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6804.599999999999s)]
*  And then they're over by the bris [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6807.88s)]
*  So they keep their eggs inside for as long as possible and then they hatch out inside of the female [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6811.0s)]
*  So it looks like they're giving live birth. I'm glad that it's not hissing because I feel like I would be in a very different [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6818.12s)]
*  Well, you don't fuck with bugs. Yeah, he's not hissing because he's nice like that. Okay, but you're not scared [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6823.4s)]
*  But not really actually held one is not [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6827.4s)]
*  Bugs break down decaying matter, which is very important. Okay, uh two they pollinate which is very very important [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6832.679999999999s)]
*  um because [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6839.799999999999s)]
*  We wouldn't have a ton of the foods that we have if we didn't have pollinating bugs coffee chocolate apples fruits, whatever [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6841.32s)]
*  um, and they [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6847.719999999999s)]
*  Regulate other bug populations carnivorous bugs help regulate other bug populations ants termites aerate our soils [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6850.12s)]
*  So that water can penetrate our soil so that they're fertile and viable soils [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6856.5199999999995s)]
*  Bugs are also a really important food source for like everything like everything eats bugs including us today [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6860.28s)]
*  Yeah, smile true [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6865.879999999999s)]

*  If a mosquito bites you it's a female that has bit you and they only bite when they have to lay eggs and they need [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6893.96s)]
*  The protein to do that. Um, so only female mosquitoes bite so male mosquitoes don't bite male mosquitoes pollinate [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6899.96s)]
*  Their pollinators and also mosquitoes are a really really important food source for a lot of animals like frogs [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6908.38s)]
*  Tadpoles eat mosquito larvae. They need to pick up the pace on yeah, i'm not yeah, especially down there [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbwCpSdHWj4&t=6914.54s)]
