# News Fatigue And Podcasts Being Labeled Right Wing | Hasanabi Reacts to Joe Rogan
**HasanAbi:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw)
*  Good reason is in like there's a good reason why people are saying I don't trust you any longer like israel related coverage for example [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=0.0s)]
*  And also for a very bad reason a very bad reason why people don't trust legacy media is because of the faucet of misinformation [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=7.04s)]
*  The jorogan experience I have to say I have such fucking news politics fatigue [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=20.16s)]
*  Already well what two months into the the sort of president the velocity of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=26.799999999999997s)]
*  Bullshit if you can get a million plays in a day because Trump got bopped on the nose by a fucking boom mic [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=32.72s)]
*  It's just the the appetite is it seems endless for it [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=39.68s)]
*  It just feels it's very it's exhausting. I'm kind of having to check out and I know that people say oh well [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=44.84s)]
*  It's a luxurious position. You don't need to pay attention to politics [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=49.76s)]
*  It's a luxurious position for you to be in people at the bottom. They do need to pay to pay attention to politics [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=52.64s)]
*  It's an interesting stat because actually the most educated wealthiest people are the ones that spend the most time consuming news and talking about politics [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=56.84s)]
*  So people at the bottom rung of the ladder that don't so that's yeah, no shit. That's kind of the fucking problem here [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=63.08s)]
*  That's why we got Donald Trump in office. Yes, if you're at the bottom rung of society you [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=69.64s)]
*  understandably see politics or what it truly is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=74.84s)]
*  Something that rich people are doing with one another that is not going to impact your life in any way and only will impact [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=78.32s)]
*  Your life in a negative way doesn't matter if you pay attention to it or not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=85.44s)]
*  That's why I'm so glad I had those two conversations with two different uber drivers yesterday. Okay [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=90.63999999999999s)]
*  One was activated through podcasts into believing a whole bunch of nonsense [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=96.38s)]
*  The other one was completely tapped out of the subject after voting for Kamala Harris and not really liking the Democrats either [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  The reason why the second person was not really invested in politics is exactly what I'm talking about [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  if you can't activate people like her, I mean think about it like [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=113.24s)]
*  She's a black woman in the United States of America who's genuinely thinking about leaving the country [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=118.08s)]
*  okay cost of living is out of control and she sees the political instability and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=123.28s)]
*  She's like maybe it's time leave like we're literally [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  We're literally seeing if we can penny pinch our way out of here [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=131.52s)]
*  There's a person that drives uber in any case the reason why that person [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=134.44s)]
*  I think I demonstrated fairly well to those who have the capacity to understand what I was doing in that conversation [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  The reason why that person is checked out is because there's no association for her with any sort of tangible [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  Policies that will improve her life. She does not hear that from the Dems at all [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=150.08s)]
*  She also doesn't think the Dems are being genuine when they advocate for things. She literally said yeah Trump does stuff [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=154.52s)]
*  But when he says something he's gonna do something. That's weakness twofold. That's it. It's not true. I'm exhausted [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=160.12s)]
*  I'm so you're allowed to be exhausted [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=166.36s)]
*  It's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=169.36s)]
*  ridiculous [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Newsweek wrote an article about how one of the names of one of our pod friend of mine Michael Costa [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  His name was misspelled [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=179.24s)]
*  accidentally [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=181.84s)]
*  on the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=183.36s)]
*  On the feed you have the on the news week. Is that you Jamie? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=184.4s)]
*  Newsweek it wasn't even misspelled. I don't know it was [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Even misspelled right it was M capital I [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=198.04s)]
*  Michael Costa [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=201.76s)]
*  Like me Kyle Costa or something. Okay [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=204.32s)]
*  Article in Newsweek ever think that your career would result in you having typos for a headline Jamie [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=209.4s)]
*  Other ones that's just the first 100% what's happens it happens people make mistakes you're typing things in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=217.88s)]
*  Yeah, but the fact that it's an article that we're being called out for a typo [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=223.48s)]
*  Must be an art, but it's just anything for clicks man [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=229.96s)]
*  So we can use anything for clicks that was something that I noticed a trend that I've noticed over the last couple of years [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=233.44s)]
*  legacy media is really struggling to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=240.92s)]
*  Garner attention itself. It seems like fewer and fewer people are listening to it. We saw that over the last election, you know [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=243.32s)]
*  It seems to me like the best way that legacy media can gain traffic is to talk about independent media [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, how many times are we seeing headlines about Andrew Huberman or about the right-wing? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=256.96s)]
*  Manosphere pipeline and how it's getting people to do this or the other side like why is there not a Joe Rogan of the left? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=263.88s)]
*  You know, whatever that whatever the headline is more and more the way that legacy media is able to achieve traffic is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=269.24s)]
*  Only in reference to independent media. Yes, so then I was opposed to us being he's not wrong. I [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=275.96s)]
*  mean [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  This is correct. There these are two guys that I don't agree with but he's right about this. I [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=285.12s)]
*  Think the real problem with legacy media. However, is that legacy publishers have dropped the ball? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  Spectacularly over and over again [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  For two reasons one for a good reason good reason as in like there's a good reason why people are saying [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=300.08s)]
*  I don't trust you any longer like Israel related coverage for example [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=305.55999999999995s)]
*  And also for a very bad reason a very bad reason why people don't trust legacy media is because of the faucet of misinformation [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=310.0s)]
*  That is infinitely easier to understand and read these two issues work side-by-side with one another if you are [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=317.76s)]
*  Serially wrong in ways that people can comprehend quickly [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=324.28s)]
*  They're not going to trust you any longer [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=329.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, you have people hamming up parasocial relationships on the independent side of things where people genuinely think like oh Joe Rogan is my friend [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=331.4s)]
*  Hassan is my friend. He's in my living room all day every day [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=338.94s)]
*  There's no way to compete with people like myself if you're a faceless journalist. That's it, especially if [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=341.76s)]
*  the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=349.88s)]
*  parasocial [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=351.6s)]
*  relationship inducing commentary is [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  also chock-full of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=356.04s)]
*  ridiculous [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=358.56s)]
*  misinformation that corresponds to the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  Preconceived biases that people have that's a huge problem. That is a huge issue [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  it's especially an issue for someone like myself because like I do work in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=368.0s)]
*  Combating misinformation with regular frequency ironically enough my liberal naysayers and independent media consistently say I'm a misinformer [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=373.24s)]
*  I'm the Alex Jones of the left, but there's a reason why a lot of these mainstream outlets [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  understand my position in the independent sphere as [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=386.12s)]
*  Someone who actively someone who has an open position who's not shy about revealing his position [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=390.72s)]
*  But will actively go after misinformation and combat misinformation directly. Okay, so because of that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=395.54s)]
*  I don't I can't work without real journalism. I [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=401.8s)]
*  Can't work without real journalism Joe Rogan can he's just gonna shoot there's real journalism out there and these guys still make shit up [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=406.94s)]
*  right I [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=414.54s)]
*  Can't just simply make shit up [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=416.38s)]
*  That's not my job [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=419.42s)]
*  My job is to look at media and and analyze it with a critical lens [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=420.74s)]
*  But that still requires there to be real journalism happening, which is why I'm so fucking terrified [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=424.94s)]
*  but my point is it's very hard to try and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=430.54s)]
*  generate support [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  for for [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=438.38s)]
*  someone who is serially [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=439.9s)]
*  Engaging in parasocial confirmation bias. It's virtually impossible [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  Joe Rogan doesn't need to convince his audience of his positions his audience likes him because of his positions [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=447.74s)]
*  Someone like myself on the other hand has to convince [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=454.66s)]
*  The audience of the positions because these positions are not one that are readily available in the wild and kind of the same goes [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=456.9s)]
*  For mainstream news as well like they have to maintain [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=463.38s)]
*  As a part of their job mainstream news outlets have to maintain [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=467.38s)]
*  The neoliberal agenda they have to maintain [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=472.85999999999996s)]
*  The idea that everything you're experiencing whether it be the cost of living crisis or whatnot is actually fine [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=476.53999999999996s)]
*  It's actually normal. It's a normal and healthy part of the process of capitalism [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=482.85999999999996s)]
*  You it's it's okay. Things are not as bad as you think they are [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=487.02s)]
*  They have to normalize the harm that you're experiencing as a big part of what the fourth estate does [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=490.82s)]
*  So in that regard, it's also very difficult for them to do that, especially in times of crisis. So when crisis comes around [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=496.82s)]
*  and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=505.14s)]
*  The the media keeps doing the same things that they do all the time to normalize the harm and pain that you're experiencing [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=507.22s)]
*  Only hyper focus on the viewpoints of like, I don't know small business owners or whatever [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=514.82s)]
*  Ultimately people like Joe Rogan who are going to take advantage of that resentment and the anger that people feel [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=518.82s)]
*  Are going to win out against mainstream news and they're gonna do it with a truck full of misinformation [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=524.9s)]
*  This dynamic exists in the duopoly and the last election cycle that took place. You have the Kamala Harris institution defenders [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=529.86s)]
*  Running against the guy who wants to put a brick through the institutions at a time when there's so much economic volatility [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=538.98s)]
*  So much anger and resentment towards [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=545.4s)]
*  um the the living conditions that people experience [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=548.44s)]
*  Uh that they directly attribute to the institutions. Yeah, of course people voted for the institution breaking party [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=551.96s)]
*  Because the institution breaking party saw that anger and resentment and said you're right to be angry and you should be angry at [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=558.36s)]
*  You know more appropriate targets obviously not fucking like, you know corporations of the powerful but instead gay corporations and the gay powerful [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=565.24s)]
*  Or or dei it is however alarming that so many people primarily get their information from the likes of joe [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=573.88s)]
*  And that they get their notes from joe like the things that joe cares about they care about too [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=581.8s)]
*  and because he's so susceptible to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=587.64s)]
*  Misinformation that corresponds to his biases people end up adopting the most idiotic positions like the first uber driver that we talked to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=591.14s)]
*  We're talking about trans sesame street terrifying prospect for the future of this country [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=598.28s)]
*  Downstream from them that now downstream from us. Yeah, and anything masculine is right wing [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=603.56s)]
*  Anything you cannot be masculine like you cannot be interested in physical fitness [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=609.4s)]

*  He used to talk about him non-stop [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=702.36s)]
*  So many episodes he would talk about his porsche. He never actually talks about cars anymore [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=704.76s)]
*  Now that you think about it. Holy shit. Yeah, he's too busy eating elon's dick every episode [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=710.12s)]

*  That is crazy [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=744.28s)]
*  Like pierce morgan is definitely right wing, okay 100 percent [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=746.36s)]
*  And even a guy that is weighing on 100 percent, uh, uh, definitely right wing 100 on many issues [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=751.56s)]
*  Still can sometimes come across as more liberal than fucking joe rogan reasonable [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=759.4s)]

*  Which is and then you're allowed to shut up. Jamie stop being i managed to thread. I managed to thread the needle of avoiding this [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=785.08s)]
*  You're gonna get on there now. They're gonna put you on now [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=791.72s)]
*  Jamie those red ones are real. Just shut up. I'm just I don't know. They're real [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=795.8000000000001s)]

*  What what do you think of the if you got a proposed reason for why? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=809.88s)]
*  This is it just a a judgment criteria that they're judging [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=815.5600000000001s)]
*  shows that aren't right wing as right wing or is it genuinely that for some reason the left is struggling to make [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=819.32s)]
*  Progress in independent media. Well, they're struggling to make progress in independent media for sure [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=825.32s)]
*  And they're trying to figure out why they're trying to figure out why these what they are calling right wing [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=829.72s)]
*  I think if you looked at all my positions [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=835.64s)]
*  I think way more of them are left wing than right wing. What are the left wing positions that you [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=838.44s)]
*  What it ended the best part [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=845.8000000000001s)]
*  Do we have more I need to see what his left positions are, you know, it's crazy [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=849.08s)]
*  Joe rogan still maintains this like independent independent media posture and in some ways I guess he is because he's like [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=853.3199999999999s)]
*  You know owned and operated singularly like it's a one person shop, right? So it is technically independent [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=860.28s)]
*  He's not mainstream figure. I mean he is a mainstream figure, but he's not mainstream media [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=867.8s)]
*  But what's really interesting about it is like bro you glaze up billionaires in the same way the fucking cnn does [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=872.1999999999999s)]
*  Like your output is not all that different from any number of different websites at this point any number of different publications at this point [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=878.36s)]
*  They also glaze billionaires and it's oftentimes the same fucking billionaires that they're glazing. It doesn't make any sense [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=885.48s)]
*  What's also very funny to me at least? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=891.72s)]
*  Is this notion that right wingers are so still to this day? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=895.24s)]
*  Even as trump is in office. It's so funny that right wingers are so embarrassed to be right wing [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=900.12s)]
*  Embarrassed to be right wing [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=904.92s)]
*  They're so fucking embarrassed [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=907.4s)]
*  To be branded as right wingers, dude. They have to say like oh, I have a lot of leftist opinions [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=910.12s)]
*  I'm an independent thinker. I'm apolitical [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=915.88s)]
*  It's like dude, you're just you voted for trump like what the fuck do you mean? You're apolitical you endorse trump is so stupid [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=918.28s)]
*  Yeah, you're right wing and you don't agree with a lot of the fucking things that the republicans say [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=926.36s)]
*  But not enough to not vote for them, you know what I mean your disagreements are not severe enough that you're like i'm out [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=931.16s)]
*  Fuck this i'm not voting for these dipshits. That's it [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=936.68s)]
*  You can still hold up. Well, the big one is having some sort of a social safety net [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=940.04s)]
*  I was on welfare when I was a kid. My family was on food stamps. We were fucking poor shit [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=945.64s)]
*  Yeah, this is old school jaw. I used to hear this all the fucking time even though he said so many conflicting things about this now [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=950.1999999999999s)]
*  Uh with his like unconditional support for the likes of ron de santos and shit, and I remember [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=956.76s)]
*  That helping us a lot. We had food [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=961.96s)]
*  Where I don't know what we would be doing if we did. I mean we we were in a bad place [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=965.0s)]
*  and [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=970.2s)]
*  There's social safety nets for people my my family got out of that [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=970.92s)]
*  And my stepfather and my mother wound up doing well [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=974.68s)]
*  They did they did really great and they they got out of debt and bought a house and great job and the whole deal [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=977.48s)]
*  But when I was a little boy [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=984.52s)]
*  We were fucked and I think social safety nets are very important for people [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=986.52s)]
*  It's very it's very important for society if you care about people you care about the whole society [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=991.9599999999999s)]
*  You don't want people starving when there's ways to [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=996.1999999999999s)]
*  develop government programs to make sure people have food [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=999.88s)]
*  and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1003.4s)]
*  I think that's [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1004.52s)]
*  This idea pull them up by their bootstraps is horseshit. Some people don't have boots. They don't have straps. They don't have nothing [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1006.12s)]
*  They're they're fucked. They're fucked from the moment. They were born [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1013.8000000000001s)]
*  They were born into a bad family environment in a bad neighborhood and crime and gangs and drugs and [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1016.6s)]
*  It's not even playing field [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1023.24s)]
*  Where are you at with health care? I think health care? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1025.96s)]
*  100 should be socially funded [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1029.6200000000001s)]
*  um, I think that [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1032.84s)]
*  Medicare and medicaid having programs where people who are hurt can get an operation and it's not going to bankrupt them for the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1034.52s)]
*  The rest of their life is another thing that I think society should be [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1041.8000000000002s)]
*  It should be a part of our agreement to take care of each other as a community that we chip in money [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1046.2800000000002s)]
*  For gov as socialist positions and I always bring up the fire department because the fire department is one of the best examples that [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1052.44s)]
*  Everybody sort of agrees. It's a socialist sort of thing you [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1058.0400000000002s)]
*  Give your tax dollars the tax dollar supports the fire department the fire department fairly puts out fires for everybody [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1062.3600000000001s)]
*  They don't not put out your fire if you don't have any money [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1068.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not like they don't the fires don't such a good example [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1071.72s)]
*  But when you compare that to the way that medical access is done at least in this country, but I also [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1074.68s)]
*  Believe in competition. I've said this before i'll say it again [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1080.28s)]

*  Like if you know anybody that's been injured and was bankrupt because they didn't have insurance [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1190.52s)]
*  And then they had to get some crazy operation and now they have this enormous debt and they wind up going bankrupt [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1195.8799999999999s)]

*  that [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1236.36s)]

*  Even after fucking endorsing donald trump, but my position is [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1250.4399999999998s)]
*  Diametrically opposed to the democratic party and they say i'm a fucking loyal. I'm a clinton head [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1254.98s)]

*  Astro turf movement funded by the coke brothers. This is the opposite of a tea party movement. This is real genuine anger and resentment from [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1278.26s)]
*  Democrat from the from the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1287.5600000000002s)]
*  democratic voter base [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1290.42s)]
*  Towards the democrats for not doing anything for not doing enough very very frustrating. You've been historically kind of woke bro. I know [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQovGMCy1mw&t=1292.52s)]
