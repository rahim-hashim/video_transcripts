# Professor Abdel Razzaq Takriti Reveals On Israel Secret In Interview | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg)
*  Or is that simply a socio-political term applied broadly to non-state actors that we want to deny [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=0.0s)]
*  habeas corpus to? I mean, this is an excellent question, and I think the answer to it is [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=6.96s)]
*  contextual. So I would invite our audience members to think. All right, we're going to have a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=12.8s)]
*  brief intermission here where I am going to be introducing to you Professor Abdul Razak Takriti, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=25.36s)]
*  who teaches modern Palestinian and Middle Eastern history at Rice University. He's the author of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=32.0s)]
*  numerous studies. Most recently, he launched the Tavra podcast on Daniel Denver's The Dig, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=37.04s)]
*  a 16 episode series surveying the modern history of the Arab lands. Hopefully we'll be able to do this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  without issue. But hello, Professor, are you there? Can you hear me? There's going to be some [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=51.04s)]
*  complications at first, but we'll get through them hopefully. But we'll have a hello. Oh, perfect. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=58.96s)]
*  Hi, how are you? How's it going? Okay. Not only can I see you, I can also hear you. So this is going [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  smoothly, I'll admit. I was definitely worried. Daniel made it seem like, I mean, he kept saying [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=73.84s)]
*  the words low tech scholar when reference. Well, I'm not that bad. I mean, you know, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=79.52s)]
*  I can manage an app or two, you know? Okay. All right. I think what he means is I don't spend my [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  time, you know, on, on, on, on the, on social media that much. Okay. Well, that's probably good [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=92.72s)]
*  for your mental health, especially right now, especially in recent times. Let me tell you, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  I just, I did a thing at USC last night with a professor that invited me to speak to her students [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=106.08s)]
*  and whoever wanted to attend. And there was a letter campaign apparently by 27,000 letters [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=113.76s)]
*  saying that I should not attend that I, that USC must not have me on board or welcome me as a guest. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=120.56s)]
*  So that's usually how it works on social media. And these are probably just [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=129.76s)]
*  Israeli trolls and that kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. No, it was, yeah. It was a, it was a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=134.88s)]
*  Zionist group on camp, on, on campus that launched it, but I guess it didn't work in their favor. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=138.55999999999997s)]
*  In any case, welcome, welcome to the broadcast. I've heard a lot about, you know, Daniel has [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  sung your praises quite a bit in terms of your acumen and your knowledge over the region and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  the history. And originally when we first were supposed to have this conversation, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=159.76s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about the history of Hezbollah because of course there are a lot of people [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=165.76s)]
*  in my community in general that are perhaps a little unfamiliar with Hezbollah, like where [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=171.92s)]
*  it started, why it started as a political movement. And I'm sure you know this already, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=178.64s)]
*  but obviously in the Western media, it's very black and white, the way we communicate about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=184.64s)]
*  America's adversaries and even America's allies. They're the good guys. And anyone that stands [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  as a resistance to American intervention in the region is officially declared a state sanctioned [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=196.72s)]
*  enemy terrorism. Let's start there. Let's start with the designation of terrorism. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=203.76s)]
*  What do you as an academic think about this designation? Is this one that has any sort of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=209.84s)]
*  like real legal precedent? Or is that simply a socio-political term applied broadly to non-state [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=216.32s)]
*  actors that we want to deny habeas corpus to? I mean this is an excellent question and I think [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=227.28s)]
*  the answer to it is contextual. So I would invite our audience members to think, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=233.44000000000003s)]
*  why is it okay for example for a state like the Israeli state to invade Lebanon, kill thousands [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  of people, injure hundreds of thousands in places like Gaza, across Palestine, terrorize the whole [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  region. If terror is about spreading fear, spreading insecurity, that's certainly what that state is [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=253.68s)]
*  doing. However, because it's a state actor that is supported by the West, that is never described [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=261.36s)]
*  as terrorism by Western countries. Even though the Israeli military is viewed in the Middle East and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=267.68s)]
*  across the Middle East as the largest terrorist force in the region. So it is all relative, it is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  all contextual, it depends on how you view things. In terms of its impact, actually the Israeli state [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=280.32s)]
*  has terrorized way more people than any of the designated terrorist groups that the United States [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=286.88s)]
*  designates as terrorists. So that's point number one. Point number two has to do with legality. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=293.36s)]
*  International order as it stands favors state actors against non-state actors and that means [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=299.92s)]
*  that it has always had a negative attitude towards liberation movements in general and these were [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=307.92s)]
*  often prone to be described as terrorists. For example, the African National Congress led by [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=315.6s)]
*  Nelson Mandela was considered to be a terrorist organization. In the United States, it only ceased [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=322.16s)]
*  to be a terrorist organization in 2008, believe it or not. The FLN, the National Liberation Front in [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=327.36s)]
*  Algeria, which liberated Algeria from a century and three decades of French colonial rule, brutal [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=336.32000000000005s)]
*  rule that killed more than a million people, that organization was described as a terrorist [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=342.56s)]
*  organization. The Irish Republican Army was described as a terrorist organization, it was [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=347.76s)]
*  designated as such. The state actors against which they were fighting were not counted as terrorists [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=354.08s)]
*  even though the damage they caused to civilians, to women, children, men, elderly men, everybody [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  in society was indescribable. You can't even begin to describe the scale of it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=365.92s)]
*  So we should always approach these words with caution and understand where they come from. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. You nailed it in terms of like the calculation of Israeli horror never being [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  designated as an act of terror even though it absolutely suits if this was a designation [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  applied evenly, Israel's actions would be considered in the exact same vein because [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=390.4s)]
*  the impact of it is the same, causing tremendous amounts of psychological harm beyond the intended [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=396.88s)]
*  targets. And in many instances, the intended targets are broadly civilians regardless. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=403.84s)]
*  Impact is worse actually, because now they're carrying out a genocide and there's no talk [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=410.96s)]
*  about anything. Who's standing up to them as they're massacring people en masse? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=415.68s)]
*  And now in direct and indirect ways, it's way worse than terror. Genocide is the worst crime [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=421.52s)]
*  in history possible for you to come and destroy already up to 15% of the population of Gaza has [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=426.8s)]
*  already been annihilated through these policies according to public health experts. This is very, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=434.72s)]
*  dangerous. Absolutely. So the question I guess I have is we are talking about resisting [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=440.8s)]
*  Israeli occupation. And I guess this brings up the first question I wanted to ask you, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=447.44s)]
*  which is about Hezbollah in its inception and its modern iteration. If you could give us some [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=453.68s)]
*  historical background as to how Hezbollah came to be, that would be wonderful for a lot of people [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  in my audience that might not know. Well, I mean, the first point to note is again the context, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=464.8s)]
*  how did Hezbollah emerge and why did it emerge? It emerged in the context of the Israeli occupation [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=470.24s)]
*  of Lebanon in 1982. In the 1970s, many of the cadres that formed Hezbollah were involved [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=475.68s)]
*  in resistance against the Israeli state, but it was through involvement in Palestinian-led movements [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=484.0s)]
*  that were stationed in Lebanon. Now, why were these movements in Lebanon in the first place? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=489.44s)]
*  It's because the Israeli state was created on the debris of Palestine. It had actually, there was [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=494.24s)]
*  no such thing as Israel before 1948. It came about in 1948. It's a settler colonial formation, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=500.32s)]
*  mostly comprised of Eastern European Jews that came on Palestinian Arab land. What happened is [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=507.04s)]
*  they expelled a lot of people across the region. Many of them ended up in Lebanon. With time, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=513.04s)]
*  these people began to form national liberation movements that sought reclaiming their land. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=518.0s)]
*  They sought liberation and return for the Palestinian refugees and those that were living in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=522.48s)]
*  Palestine. So the Palestinian aspect is very important to understand in this equation. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=528.08s)]
*  And that's important for our listeners today. Sometimes they might wonder why the hell does [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=532.72s)]
*  Hezbollah care about Gaza? Why is it so connected to the Palestinian cause? That's the context to [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=536.72s)]
*  that. Now, of course, most of Hezbollah's members, in fact, all of them come from the Shia sect in [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  Lebanon. Lebanon is a country that is governed by a sectarian system that was created by French [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=550.4s)]
*  colonialism there. They divided people by sect. And one of the most important sects is the Shia [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=555.6s)]
*  sect there. However, it was always underrepresented in the Lebanese political system. And as a result, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=562.0s)]
*  they found common cause with the Palestinian refugees that were expelled by the Israeli state [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  to Lebanon historically. They had good and strong social connections with them. They were [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=574.24s)]
*  joined also by class interests because they were poor and the Palestinian refugees that were [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=580.24s)]
*  expelled there were poor. Geographic interconnections, the south of Lebanon where most of the Shias are [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=585.6s)]
*  concentrated is very interconnected with the north of Palestine, which is where most of the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=590.8s)]
*  Palestinian refugees that ended up in Lebanon come from. So all of this meant that there was [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=595.44s)]
*  enormous sympathy for the Palestinian cause. There was an enormous understanding that Israel [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=600.16s)]
*  as a settler colonial state is a threat to Lebanon, not just Palestine. It's a threat to the whole [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=604.32s)]
*  region. And this is the experience that Hezbollah fighters went through before Hezbollah was created [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=609.2s)]
*  in the 1970s. Then in 1982, the Israeli invasion happens. Israel invades Lebanon. As what we're [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=616.24s)]
*  seeing today, they're claiming that they wanted security for themselves. But in fact, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=624.24s)]
*  they're always expanding. There's no security expected for anybody else except for the settler [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=629.2s)]
*  colonists there. This is that general attitude, which is similar to settler colonists populations [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=633.84s)]
*  everywhere. They think their lives are more worthy, that the security of others is less important. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=640.08s)]
*  We see this in American pronouncements today, Hassan. Why is it that Biden and his entire team [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=646.96s)]
*  just keep on speaking about defending Israel? What about defending Palestinians? What about [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  defending Lebanese? What about defending Iranians? What about defending Turks, anybody in this region [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  that is affected by this aggressive settler colonial state? They do not matter. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=663.28s)]
*  So this is the context to the emergence of Hezbollah. In 1982, Israel invades. It kills 20,000 [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=670.24s)]
*  people. It destroys the whole place. It was the worst invasion that we had seen until the Gaza [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=677.36s)]
*  genocide. It was really horrific in 1982. And they broke every international norm. They occupied a [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=685.36s)]
*  major Arab capital, Beirut. And in the process, you started to have a resistance movement emerging [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=691.28s)]
*  against them. Now, that resistance movement, in the case of there were multiple ones, but from the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=698.16s)]
*  Shia quarter in Lebanon, Hezbollah came about. It included fighters that had fought before in the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=705.36s)]
*  Palestinian revolution. It also included people that were rejuvenated by the Iranian revolution. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=710.56s)]
*  They saw what had happened in Iran, and they decided that they're going to follow an Islamic [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=718.96s)]
*  path towards the revolution. Previously, many of these people had joined the left or had been part [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=726.24s)]
*  of anti-colonial resistance in the Palestinian movement. Now, they were inspired by a new model [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=731.2s)]
*  that was offered by the Iranian revolution. And in theological terms, strictly theological terms, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=737.6s)]
*  our viewers may or may not be familiar with this concept. They adhere to something called [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=743.2s)]
*  vilayat al-faqih, or vilayat al-faqih as we would say in Arabic. That means the governance of the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=747.84s)]
*  jurists. They agreed with the Iranian line that was proposed by Ayatollah Khomeini, which said [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=752.88s)]
*  that the nation has to be ruled in accordance with the precepts of religion through the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=758.72s)]
*  interpretation of the jurists. So that was a controversial line in Shia circles. It continues [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=766.72s)]
*  to be. But Hezbollah were adherents to that line. And in Lebanon, they became associated with it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=773.6s)]
*  They developed a very close relationship with the post-revolutionary Iranian government. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=781.76s)]
*  Some of the most horrific acts of mass murder that some people in the chat might recognize [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=788.64s)]
*  in 1982 was of course the Sabra and Shatila massacre, where the IDF struck a mostly Palestinian [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=795.52s)]
*  and Lebanese Shia compromised area in the city of Beirut, where Christian militias inside of [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=805.84s)]
*  Lebanon, Falangist militias inside of Lebanon, committed heinous atrocities and were directly [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=813.76s)]
*  supported by the IDF in that process. And the conservative estimations are between 1,300 and [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=823.28s)]
*  3,500 civilians that were ruthlessly slaughtered. Many of the immediate propaganda that came out, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=832.56s)]
*  the atrocity propaganda that you might have even heard from the likes of Joe Biden, as a matter of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=840.24s)]
*  fact, without any sort of evidence whatsoever, repeated post-October 7, were actually real [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=845.8399999999999s)]
*  documented atrocities that occurred in Sabra and Shatila. And the only reason why I bring this up, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=851.92s)]
*  I think, is to help people understand the collective conscious and the collective psyche of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  the Lebanese and the Palestinian refugee population in these areas in terms of the way that they [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=865.52s)]
*  analyze Israeli acts of violence, Israeli incursions. Just so people are clear. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  I recorded 40 hours with Daniel Denver on The Dig, the podcast, the famous podcast. We did a [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=880.32s)]
*  series called Thawra, just detailing this history. It is a very complex history, but I would encourage [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=886.48s)]
*  our listeners to check it out. But seriously, for us to understand what's going on, we have to [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=892.08s)]
*  realize that there's an accumulation of both Israeli colonial violence, but also American support [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=899.28s)]
*  for it. The reason why Sabra and Shatila happened isn't just because the Israelis unleashed their [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=904.24s)]
*  militias that they had trained and armed these Lebanese militias that were under their control. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=909.6s)]
*  It wasn't just because their army besieged the camp and facilitated this process. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=918.4s)]
*  It wasn't because they gave the order for it. It's more than that. It's part of the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=924.16s)]
*  total betrayal of the United States to the agreements that it had signed. The U.S. had [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  sent an envoy in 1982 demanding that the PLO exit. The PLO said, the Palestine Liberation Organization, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=937.2800000000001s)]
*  said, okay, you know what, we'll exit, but how do we guarantee the safety of the women and children [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=947.44s)]
*  and the elderly people that will be left in their Palestinian refugee camps, given the fact that our [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=953.6s)]
*  fighters will no longer be there to defend them? And the U.S. gave guarantees. The whole international [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=958.88s)]
*  system was supposed to uphold these guarantees. Nothing happened. Israelis were allowed to go [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=965.92s)]
*  kill, inflict this one-ton destruction on the Palestinian people. It was one of the worst [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=971.12s)]
*  massacres in our history. Now, of course, in Gaza, everything pales in comparison to Gaza because [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=977.52s)]
*  it's full-on genocide. But up till that point, seriously, these heinous crimes were unbelievable. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=983.52s)]
*  So, of course, that led to the resistance option that was proposed by Hezbollah to become very [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=989.36s)]
*  popular. Because, look, people here talk, I mean, they talk about, okay, why aren't the Lebanese [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=994.88s)]
*  people peaceful? Why aren't the Palestinian people peaceful? Why aren't the Iranian people? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1001.52s)]
*  All of this talk, unlike everybody's peace-loving, actually in our region, we need peace [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1005.28s)]
*  for us because the level of destruction imposed on us is much bigger. But there's a big difference [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1009.2s)]
*  between peace and pacification. Pacification means that I keep on beating you up. I'm the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1015.0400000000001s)]
*  bully that will actually destroy your life, and your job is to completely submit and keep on taking [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1022.4000000000001s)]
*  hits whenever I want to give you hits. And that is an unreasonable thing to expect any human being [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1028.72s)]
*  to accept. Our people are human, despite the fact that a lot of American officials don't seem to [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1035.2800000000002s)]
*  think that, despite the fact that certainly Israeli racist officials will never accept that. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1041.92s)]
*  This has to do with racism as much as it has to do with anything else, Hassan. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1047.3600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. So let's talk about, I guess, the modern iteration of Hezbollah as well, if you [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1051.0400000000002s)]
*  don't mind. And then I want to move into Iran a little bit as well, considering that this [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1061.12s)]
*  conversation was supposed to center around Hezbollah and its reception in the region broadly [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  as a resistance force against Israeli incursion, specifically both in Lebanon, but also as a [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1077.76s)]
*  deterrence factor against Israel's ongoing genocide and occupation in Gaza. But since then, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1084.72s)]
*  of course, Iran has chosen to retaliate for Israel assassinating IRGC commanders inside of [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1092.08s)]
*  Beirut and in other places, as well as a direct violation of Iranian sovereignty. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1103.28s)]
*  When Israel assassinated Ismail Haniyeh, the Politburo chief of Hamas, the person that was [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1110.1599999999999s)]
*  the principal negotiator in the hostage negotiations that were ongoing, Israel did this, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1116.96s)]
*  of course, in Tehran, which was a direct violation of Iranian sovereignty, which Iran said that they [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1122.56s)]
*  would inevitably retaliate towards. And it seems like today was that retaliation. But in terms of [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah, a lot of the conversation, in my estimation at least, a lot of the conversations [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1135.6s)]
*  surrounding Hezbollah and the Israeli incursion into Lebanon has been basically repackaging the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1143.76s)]
*  exact same type of propaganda that we saw with respect to Hamas, that Israel wasn't simply [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1149.1999999999998s)]
*  pummeling Gaza into submission, that it wasn't engaging in an act of genocide, but instead was [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1156.32s)]
*  actually liberating the Palestinian people from the treacherous nature of Hamas. And now the exact [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1161.6s)]
*  same propaganda almost reset, where Israel is technically liberating the Lebanese population [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1168.1599999999999s)]
*  from Hezbollah. Is there any truth to this kind of propaganda in your estimation? Or what is the [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1179.04s)]
*  broad reception of Hezbollah look like in the eyes of the Lebanese population? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1185.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, I've alluded earlier in the interview to the sectarian nature of Lebanese politics. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1193.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, as a result of two civil wars in the 19th century, and as a result of various [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1199.76s)]
*  influences, including a few decades of French colonialism, Lebanon was designed as a sectarian [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1208.56s)]
*  state. And what that meant is that your religious background determines who you are as a Lebanese [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1216.8s)]
*  citizen. It has serious implications for politics. It means that people are ossified, they get frozen [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1223.52s)]
*  into their sectarian identities when it comes to political behavior. And that meant also that [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1232.0s)]
*  you get political allegiances often correspond to sectarian lines. There are challenges to this. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1238.24s)]
*  The Lebanese left was always secular, for example. There have been movements that have emerged, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1245.04s)]
*  that have mobilized people across religious and sectarian divides, including Hezbollah in [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1250.0s)]
*  certain moments, by the way. And Hezbollah still has an audience outside its immediate sect. However, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1254.88s)]
*  the Israeli policy has always followed a doctrine that they've had since the early days of the [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1261.52s)]
*  Zionist movement, before there was even an Israeli state. And that doctrine was called the peripheries [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1268.72s)]
*  doctrine. For people that want to Google it, they can check that out. The idea is always- [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1274.0s)]
*  What was it again? Can you say that again? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1279.2s)]
*  The peripheries doctrine. So their notion is to focus on minorities and create tension between [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  different religious groups or tribal groups or national groups in the region surrounding them [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1292.16s)]
*  so that they could actually weaken the regional system and be able to establish their [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1299.28s)]
*  settler-colonial dominance in the region. That's not particular to the Israeli state, by the way. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1304.72s)]
*  Settler-colonial states often use these tactics of divide and rule. In Lebanon, they've used it [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1309.68s)]
*  extensively. And in Lebanon, what has happened is they didn't invent the sectarian divide there, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1315.28s)]
*  but they've certainly exploited it. And they were bound to exploit it. They're exploiting it now. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1321.28s)]
*  Look at the areas they're bombing. They're actually targeting a religious group. They're [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1326.8799999999999s)]
*  targeting a religious minority in the region. And nobody's talking about that, by the way, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1331.36s)]
*  that every village, every town, every city that's being targeted is a Shia area. This is actually [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1337.36s)]
*  terrible. It's a major religious crime against a religious group in the region. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1344.32s)]
*  But they're also trying to create tension between that group. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1351.12s)]
*  Not dissimilar to ISIS, I might add, in the exact nature, whether it be to shield [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1353.4399999999998s)]
*  with a false religious justification to shield your actions or to target religious minorities [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1362.0s)]
*  in the region. Yeah. I mean, the only thing that we can say about Israel is that the Israeli [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1369.68s)]
*  government at the moment and the whole political system of Zionism is that it's driven by [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  settler-colonial precepts. They will use any method, including targeting religious [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1386.24s)]
*  groups to achieve their objectives. And they've done it before. They try to co-opt certain [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1390.88s)]
*  religious groups sometimes. They try to marginalize others. It's a fair game for them to kill [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1396.72s)]
*  people and to target people. They don't care. And this is an unfortunate reality in our world today, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1406.32s)]
*  is that they're given license to do that. I mean, because they're backed by the world's [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1413.6000000000001s)]
*  biggest empire, which happens to be the country that we live in here, the country that we pay [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1418.72s)]
*  taxes to, the country that we work in. And in this setting, it's creating a lot of dissonance for [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1426.08s)]
*  a lot of people here. How can we be supporting a project that is based on the destruction [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1435.28s)]
*  of the entire regional neighborhood? This is a state that knows nothing but escalation, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1442.3999999999999s)]
*  expansionism, and total war. It is a martialist state. And again, this is not particular to it. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1448.48s)]
*  Settler-colonial states tend to behave that way. The apartheid South Africa was wreaking havoc on [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1456.64s)]
*  the entire southern part of the African continent. They were spreading chaos there. The PNW in Algeria [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1462.96s)]
*  were totally genocidal in their mindset, and they killed millions of people, like over a million [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1470.32s)]
*  Algerians. That's how these settler groups behave. But why is it that they're given sanction to [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1475.28s)]
*  behave that way? There's no limit placed on them. It's outrageous, Hassan. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1481.84s)]
*  Absolutely. In terms of the Iranian retaliation, or I guess even with the [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1488.16s)]
*  with the existence of Hezbollah, much has been said about Hezbollah's actions in Syria or even [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1497.2s)]
*  in its domestic affairs inside of Lebanon. But Israel has consistently reiterated the position [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1505.44s)]
*  that the assassination campaign, which of course targeted thousands of civilians alongside a couple [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1511.28s)]
*  key leaders, which are simply regarded as collateral damage in Western media. The assassination [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1518.24s)]
*  campaign was conducted specifically to try and decouple Hezbollah from Gaza. Could you speak to [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1526.24s)]
*  the similarities within the Ansarallah regime as well? Or if that's outside of your purview [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1535.2s)]
*  or expertise, that's also perfectly fine. I didn't ask about that to Danny. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1540.8s)]
*  No, no, that's totally fine. I mean, I can tell you something. But yeah, go ahead, Hassan. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1545.44s)]
*  Well, the question I have is, the question I have, I guess, is that what do you say to people, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1552.64s)]
*  again, that consider Hezbollah to be a terror group and fundamentalist overall? I guess it's [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1559.2800000000002s)]
*  that has nothing to do with the reasons as to why Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah or the [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1568.4s)]
*  leadership of Hezbollah and everything to do with the fact that Hezbollah was a deterrence mechanism [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1573.2s)]
*  against Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza. Let me tell you an interesting thing, Hassan. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1579.76s)]
*  In our country here, in this country, when we encounter people usually who attack Hezbollah [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1587.76s)]
*  as fundamentalists and all these groups as fundamentalists, they tend to be fundamentalists [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1594.0s)]
*  themselves. People in the Republican Party who belong to actual ephesians, okay, they believe [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1597.6s)]
*  in religious conservatism. That's what Hezbollah believes in. I would say the religious conservatism [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1603.44s)]
*  Hezbollah is milder actually because they're not so obsessed with certain things like abortion and [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1608.8s)]
*  they don't spend their whole time focusing on attacking gay rights and that sort of thing. So [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1615.2s)]
*  in a way, actually, the groups here are way more conservative. However, if what we're talking about [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1620.1599999999999s)]
*  is religious conservatism, I might disagree with that personally. I'm not a religious conservative, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1625.84s)]
*  okay? But the issue here is not their Islamic character. What they actually don't like about [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1631.2s)]
*  Hezbollah, and let me be very clear here, the U.S. has historically supported Islamic groups [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1637.6s)]
*  in many parts of the world against what they perceive to be a communist infiltration. So in [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1644.7199999999998s)]
*  Afghanistan, for example, they produced Al-Qaeda to fight the Soviet Union. The predecessors to [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1650.1599999999999s)]
*  Al-Qaeda were actually created by the U.S. and with Saudi funding, okay? And this is something [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1655.52s)]
*  that's well established in the scholarly literature, Hassan. There's no doubt about it. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1662.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. It's a fact. So they don't have a problem with religion. They don't have a problem with [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1666.72s)]
*  religious fundamentalism. The issue they have with is where is it directed? And let's be clear, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1672.08s)]
*  Hezbollah is way, way less religious fundamentalist than any of the groups that we have described, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1679.04s)]
*  you know, Haida or any of that. Or I mean, even the current Saudi administration that we are closely [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1685.3600000000001s)]
*  aligned with on top of Saudi Arabia, obviously being a wonderful ally to the state of Israel as [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1690.48s)]
*  well. Yeah, and they're less fundamentalist than the Israeli state. The Israeli state is officially [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1697.6s)]
*  now ruled by Jewish supremacist parties that say that, they actually say this on a regular basis, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1704.56s)]
*  that there should be, one of the parties is called Jewish supremacy. They consider themselves to be [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1710.64s)]
*  superior to Palestinians, superior to Arabs, better than them. They should be oppressed forever. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1715.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's an officially racist doctrine based on religion. And in the case of some of these [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1720.88s)]
*  parties, you know, Ben Gavir, Smotrich, these are real zealots. So let's not now spend too much [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1724.88s)]
*  time thinking that the problem with Hezbollah is their religious affiliation. Their problem with [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1733.68s)]
*  Hezbollah is their geopolitical alignment. And that's their issue. There's been always a [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1738.08s)]
*  fundamental issue in this region. Nobody wanted a Zionist project in this region. Nobody wanted the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1745.9199999999998s)]
*  settler colonial state in this region from within the region. It was always a project imposed from [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1752.3999999999999s)]
*  outside. And it's not a project that is good, even for the settler colonial community itself. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1758.0s)]
*  And we know this in the case of South Africa and other cases. You know, the Afrikaans for a long [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1765.68s)]
*  time deluded themselves thinking that they could live forever, ruling over a black majority, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1771.44s)]
*  having total disregard to their regional neighborhood. We have the same situation [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1777.28s)]
*  now with this Israeli state. Hezbollah, other groups, they will not accept this idea that [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1780.56s)]
*  the Israeli state should be allowed to go and massacre Palestinians en masse, carry out [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1787.68s)]
*  a total genocide without anybody intervening. If they accept that idea, then they're also setting [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1794.8s)]
*  a serious precedent for themselves. You know, let's say the Israelis finish the job in Gaza, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1801.3600000000001s)]
*  finish the job, by the way, has a horrific meaning. It means kill everyone. That's what [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1807.28s)]
*  they're doing now. Okay. If they do that, then Lebanon will be next. Then the rest of the region [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1811.52s)]
*  will be next. It's a very dangerous phenomenon. Trump now is talking about annexing the West Bank [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1818.4s)]
*  to Israeli state. The West Bank will be next. This project has no limits. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1824.72s)]
*  One other aspect of this, for, I guess, like Western squishy liberals who are like, oh, well, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1830.08s)]
*  you know, Hezbollah is this or that is the reality that, and this is a J-Post article that I have in [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1840.1599999999999s)]
*  front of me, that Israel also in the targeted assassination strikes that they conducted in [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1846.0s)]
*  Lebanon in these dense suburbs, densely populated with civilians, also engaged in assassinations on [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1850.88s)]
*  three PFLP leaders in Kola, in the Kola district of Beirut. Now the PFLP is not a religious group [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1859.68s)]
*  at all. As a matter of fact, it's simply a Marxist group. This is of course very similar to, once [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1869.8400000000001s)]
*  again, another assassination that Israel had engaged in with Ghassan Qanafani. Again, famously, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1876.08s)]
*  not a very religious person, but simply a Marxist. And to make matters worse, of course, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1883.12s)]
*  that insult injury, the PFLP leaders that were killed were not actually engaged in the tit for [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1890.0s)]
*  tat cross border missile campaigns that were being conducted between Hezbollah and Israel, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1897.76s)]
*  which Israel was still responsible for 82% of the of the munitions being deployed there. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1903.6s)]
*  Having said that, this simply shows once again, that it has nothing to do with even border security [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1909.28s)]
*  for the Northern territories of Israel, but instead has everything to do with the fact that Israel gets [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1916.8799999999999s)]
*  to kill whichever leadership or whichever commander or whoever says that they do not like Israel's [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1923.1999999999998s)]
*  genocide in the region. I mean, let's imagine that it is about border security. Let's imagine [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1931.04s)]
*  that for a second. They always use security arguments. Why should they have security and [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1937.68s)]
*  nobody else in the region should have security? I mean, this is the real fundamental question here. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1943.2s)]
*  What does security mean? I mean, their version of security is I dominate the region. I do not give [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1948.8799999999999s)]
*  freedom to the Palestinian people. I do not create democracy. What I create is a Jewish state that is [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1955.36s)]
*  supremacist in character, that rejects people from other religions, rejects people from other [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1962.8799999999999s)]
*  ethnicities, and has a project of permanent domination over them. That is not acceptable. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1968.4799999999998s)]
*  By the way, there's a lot of Jewish descent in this country and elsewhere now around this, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1974.24s)]
*  especially amongst younger people. So they're upset that this that this settler colonial state [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1978.6399999999999s)]
*  is actually using the good name of Judaism to pursue its actions because it has nothing to do [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1985.04s)]
*  with Judaism. No religion actually would sanction the sort of actions that are being taken now by [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1991.6s)]
*  the Israeli state. It is a genocidal state. It is a state that has been described by Human Rights [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=1997.28s)]
*  Watch, by Amnesty, and by other major human rights organizations as an apartheid state. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2003.12s)]
*  It is a state that has broken more UN resolutions than any other state in history. It is, in fact, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2008.8s)]
*  if you want the technical definition of a rogue state, it fits that definition. It is a rogue state. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2014.88s)]
*  It is a state that that goes rogue against the entire international order. Now we have [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2020.64s)]
*  ICJ decisions on it. It doesn't want to accept it. The International Court of Justice has ruled that [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2027.8400000000001s)]
*  it's plausibly genocidal. They don't want, they don't care. It has ruled that they should stop [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2033.2s)]
*  what they're doing in Gaza. They don't care. And now in Lebanon, they're not caring either. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2037.6000000000001s)]
*  Assassinations is one of their methods. They use it against everyone, Hassan, as you've noted. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2042.16s)]
*  They've used it before against the leaders of the PLO, the leaders of FATAH. These were not Islamists. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2047.92s)]
*  They've used it against PFLP leaders. They've used it against people from multiple designations [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2054.64s)]
*  and groups. They've used it against our Christian leaders, somebody like the great poet, Kamal Nasr. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2060.08s)]
*  These were people that were murdered because they were intellectuals, because they were [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2070.7999999999997s)]
*  thinkers, because they were actually calling for anti-colonial revolution. And there's a big [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2074.56s)]
*  difference between anti-colonial revolution and terror, by the way, Hassan. Now speaking of Hezbollah, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2079.92s)]
*  I'm not a Hezbollah member. I'm not a Hezbollah supporter. I have no affiliation whatsoever with [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2086.48s)]
*  that. But at the same time, I'm somebody who's an analyst and understands the region. And I will [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2092.56s)]
*  tell you something very clearly. Should the Israeli state seize its project of domination in this part [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2099.04s)]
*  of the world? Should it give freedom to the Palestinian people? Should it stop threatening [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2105.12s)]
*  the people of Lebanon? Should it stop its expansionism across this region and its project [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2109.84s)]
*  to continue its anti-colonial domination? Should it democratize and actually say, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2115.68s)]
*  okay, we'll be a state that's not based on religion. It's going to be based on citizenship. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2124.08s)]
*  We're going to allow the Palestinian refugees to return. We're going to allow everybody to vote. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2128.24s)]
*  We're going to consider everybody to be sisters and brothers in citizenship. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2133.04s)]
*  Then people would not have a problem with it. But they cannot accept that. And if you say this, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2137.7599999999998s)]
*  they'll tell you, oh, you're against Israel's right to exist. I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm against the [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2141.4399999999996s)]
*  existence of a racially based order of domination. I'm not against the Israeli people living in this [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2147.7599999999998s)]
*  territory. They don't come from our lands. But they've been in them for quite a while now. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2157.04s)]
*  Some of them have been there for one generation or two. A few of them have been there for three or [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2162.96s)]
*  more. That's okay. We're not against anybody's presence in this region so long as they actually [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2167.36s)]
*  respect everyone else. Integrate with everybody else. Stop thinking that you're above the law, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2174.64s)]
*  above international norms, that you can get away with the genocide. That's the problem with [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2180.64s)]
*  settler colonialism. It creates an order in which the leaderships imagine this and they start then [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2185.28s)]
*  mobilizing the whole populace around settler colonial visions of domination. We seriously [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2191.92s)]
*  believe, and we must insist on a joint future for everyone in this region, including, by the way, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2198.8s)]
*  Israelis. I mean, this colonialism does not benefit them. It's not good for them. It's not [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2204.32s)]
*  good for anybody. You know, Frantz Fanon, the great anti-colonial thinker, he was a great [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2209.1200000000003s)]
*  psychologist. I'm sure you're familiar with him, Hassan, aren't you? Yeah. I mean, he wrote studies [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2214.8s)]
*  about how settler colonialism creates a total collapse in the psychology of both the colonizer [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2220.32s)]
*  and the colonized. It has serious repercussions for everybody. Absolutely. It is, I mean, you see it [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2230.1600000000003s)]
*  in Israeli society, both with the direct consequences of like Israel's bloody war and genocide [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2236.88s)]
*  around the entire region. You have their economy downgrading. You have ports that are now bankrupt. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2242.9599999999996s)]
*  You have Israeli economy collapsing entirely. It's already been a state that has been completely [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2248.72s)]
*  funded and facilitated and propped up by first the British and then of course the United States [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2254.08s)]
*  of America. But even beyond that, I feel like people behave as though the supply of bombs is [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2259.3599999999997s)]
*  infinite and people behave as though there is an endless amount of bloodshed that they can engage [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2266.72s)]
*  in without incurring any sort of penalties. But also on top of that, I think from a more holistic [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2271.76s)]
*  approach, I think that the Israeli psyche has been collectively broken in terms of the way that they [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2277.84s)]
*  analyze their role in the region. And I think that there is a steady cycle of dehumanization [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2285.28s)]
*  in the form of social conditioning, in the form of propaganda that needs to justify the violence [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2293.0400000000004s)]
*  that is a necessity to maintain an apartheid even when you are not conducting a genocide, right? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2300.08s)]
*  And I think that that also has caused many Israelis that we see, at least on Twitter, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2305.68s)]
*  on social media, behave in incredibly violent ways, not recognizing why they are becoming a [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2312.56s)]
*  pariah state, not just in the Third World, not just in the Global South where Israel was always [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2319.7599999999998s)]
*  viewed as a settler colonial pariah state, but now even in Western Europe, which is actually [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2325.2s)]
*  relatively new. I mean, I've spoken about Palestinian emancipation for almost a decade at this point in [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2332.64s)]
*  my professional commentary career, and I've never seen the attitudes shift so wildly in the [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2339.6s)]
*  direction of the recognition of the humanity of Palestinians before. And I think that Israeli [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2345.9199999999996s)]
*  society as a whole does not recognize that and does not understand what those consequences will [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2352.56s)]
*  be. I do, however, think the Israeli government understands that reality. And I think that [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2358.56s)]
*  the last ditch desperate attempts are coming from the government, both with Benjamin Netanyahu's [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2364.72s)]
*  personal ambition and staying in power, so he doesn't withstand any sort of like [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2371.68s)]
*  a prosecutorial scrutiny. But also on top of that, I think there are people in positions of power [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2377.44s)]
*  within Israel and even in the American State Department, the ideologically committed to [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2384.6400000000003s)]
*  Israel's death and destruction that see that basically see the writing on the wall in terms [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2390.08s)]
*  of the way that the globe is seeing Israel and are saying like, this is your last opportunity to [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2397.6s)]
*  grab as much territory as possible. That's the problem. They do see it in these terms, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2404.24s)]
*  but also some of them see it in messianic terms and religious fundamentalist terms where they think [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2411.12s)]
*  that actually now is the time to eradicate the Palestinians, to take over the entirety of [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2416.3199999999997s)]
*  what they consider to be the Holy Land, and then basically establish a completely [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2422.9599999999996s)]
*  land free of non-Jews there. And this is a problem. And then, of course, as they defend this [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2432.56s)]
*  project, which is rooted in racial supremacy, the Israeli officials have also weaponized a very [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2439.04s)]
*  legitimate and historically valid issue, which is, of course, that of anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2445.68s)]
*  is one of the greatest challenges that the world faced, certainly in the Second World War. And [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2453.2s)]
*  we've seen that materialized in the Holocaust. It was appalling. It was horrible. It was a [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2458.16s)]
*  European invention and has resulted in the destruction of much of Europe's jewelry. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2462.96s)]
*  But to come and say that critiquing a very violent racially supremacist system, that of Israeli [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2468.7999999999997s)]
*  cyclical colonialism, is equivalent to anti-Semitism, is absolutely outrageous. And it is an insult [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2475.92s)]
*  to the memory of millions of innocent Jews that have perished on the hands of anti-Semites [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2482.48s)]
*  in Germany and elsewhere. It is also totally disrespectful to the idea of preventing genocide [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2487.52s)]
*  in the future. I mean, now what we're seeing in Gaza now is genocidal. We must prevent it. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2495.52s)]
*  And you can't kill all these people as Benjamin Netanyahu and then play victim. Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2502.56s)]
*  is not a victim. He is an aggressor. He is a bloodthirsty demagogue who is carrying out a genocide. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2508.0s)]
*  And his entire cabinet is in it. And actually, currently, the current US government is fully [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2516.08s)]
*  involved in it. So this whole system has a problem in it. And they realize that there are shifts [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2522.8s)]
*  in American public opinion around this, that there are shifts amongst the youth. There's a huge shift [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2530.0s)]
*  in Jewish public opinion around this, especially in the United States. Nobody wants to accept this [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2535.92s)]
*  anymore. So something is happening. Something profound is happening. However, in the meantime, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2541.36s)]
*  there's a lot of people suffering, Hassan. And that's the bit that people like you and me [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2547.84s)]
*  worry about. Because, yes, eventually these projects will self-destruct. They will not go [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2553.28s)]
*  anywhere because it's a project rooted in a vision of permanent injustice. That doesn't work. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2560.2400000000002s)]
*  Visions of permanent injustice produce too many enemies because you oppress people too much. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2566.32s)]
*  It happened in Haiti. I'll give you an example. In Haiti, the first great anti-colonial revolution [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2571.12s)]
*  of our time, of modern times, happened in Haiti. The whole population was enslaved. I had a bunch [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2576.32s)]
*  of slavers that were saying, everybody is under the boot. You have an enlightened leader comes in, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2581.28s)]
*  Toussaint Louverture, a wonderful black revolutionary, a formerly enslaved person who [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2586.56s)]
*  goes and manages to organize people. And they create one of the greatest revolutions of all time, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2591.84s)]
*  possibly the greatest, actually, most inspiring for sure. He says, I just want us to be sisters [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2597.84s)]
*  and brothers with the colonizer. We just want to be French citizens. We just want to be equal. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2603.84s)]
*  And they go and imprison him, kill him, and betray him. So that leads then to the emergence of a [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2610.08s)]
*  different vision that's less inclusive of the colonists. There's a lean lead, a much more [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2620.08s)]
*  violent war of liberation, and we end up with a different situation. This is what settler [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2625.04s)]
*  colonialists do. We don't want that to happen. We can say they're going to self-destruct. They're [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2632.32s)]
*  going to create that. We don't want that to happen. We don't want them to also kill a lot of people [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2640.8s)]
*  along the way, which is exactly what they're doing now. Somebody has to come and put some common sense [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2644.24s)]
*  into this situation. Now, on the Hezbollah side, they have actually been very restrained. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2649.36s)]
*  Up until 2000, almost all their operations, in fact, all of their operations, were geared towards [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2656.4s)]
*  getting the Israeli troops out of Lebanon. Let's not forget, and this is the context that our [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2663.76s)]
*  viewers have to remember, Israel occupied Lebanon directly for many, many years. It had control over [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2668.32s)]
*  the Lebanese south. From 1978 onwards, it had various forms of control there and occupation. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2675.92s)]
*  It has also developed proxy groups allied to it there that were wreaking havoc and causing major [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2683.44s)]
*  insecurity. These were gangsters, the south Lebanon army and others, very vicious. They were just [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2689.6800000000003s)]
*  dominating the people. That's the original struggle that they had with Hezbollah. From 2000 onwards, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2698.56s)]
*  our main issue with Hezbollah is to make sure that the Palestinians never get supported, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2704.4s)]
*  first of all, and make sure that Hezbollah does not get activated in favor of Iran in any [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2710.48s)]
*  confrontation that the Israeli state wants to have with it. Here, what that meant was that they're [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2718.64s)]
*  willing to go into a serious war. In 2006, they went and destroyed large parts of Lebanon, killed [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2725.12s)]
*  a lot of people. Again, people have historical amnesia. They forget that this violent settler [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2731.2s)]
*  colonial regime has waged war on the people of Lebanon for decades. Then, of course, Hezbollah [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2737.04s)]
*  was also restrained with them. It allowed for a UN force to come into the territory and act as a [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2742.7999999999997s)]
*  buffer zone. Even though, by the way, that should not happen. Settler colonial states should not be [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2749.2s)]
*  protected actually by the UN or anybody else. They should be pressured by the whole international [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2754.72s)]
*  community to seize their settler colonials. You want the honest truth. But in this reality, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2759.76s)]
*  Hezbollah is very restrained. It understands that there is an international order that supports the [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2765.76s)]
*  settler colonial state. It's very restrained. Now- [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2770.88s)]
*  —Same with Iran as well. There's a very simple calculation here. If you look at the Iranian [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2773.84s)]
*  retaliation that occurred today, and you look at the actual civilian casualties, despite the fact [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2780.96s)]
*  that Iran demonstrated its capabilities this time with obvious expertise that they can penetrate [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2786.88s)]
*  through the Israeli security, that Iran does have the capabilities of, if it wanted to choose to do [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2795.28s)]
*  so, strike targets at scale, civilian targets as well at scale if they chose to do so. And yet, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2803.2000000000003s)]
*  they struck three military targets today. The amount of people that Hezbollah in its tit for tat [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2812.48s)]
*  bombing campaigns against Israel and the amount of people that Iran has killed in its retaliation [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2821.04s)]
*  against Israel is laughable in comparison to the untold amount of the deaths of thousands of people, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2828.56s)]
*  both in Gaza and the deaths of now a thousand at least people in Lebanon that Israel has engaged in. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2837.12s)]
*  So in terms of the civilian casualty, in terms of the enemy combatant versus civilian ratio, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2844.08s)]
*  if we're going to look at this in a cold and calculated way, obviously Israel does come [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2851.68s)]
*  across as the far greater evil if the morality was made to be an even playing field, which it is not. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2858.0s)]
*  Obviously there is a nuclear armed superpower here that is backed by the largest hegemonic [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2865.68s)]
*  superpower on the planet that is doing this death and destruction as a settler colonial state. We're [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2871.6s)]
*  not even considering that, but even if you were to consider it on an even playing field, then yes, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2876.48s)]
*  the restraint is obvious in terms of the way that these actors, non-state actors, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2884.0s)]
*  or I guess Hezbollah is in a unique position because they are a part of the Lebanese Parliament as [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2890.72s)]
*  well and also Iran as a state actor has demonstrated restraint time and time again. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2895.04s)]
*  I mean you have here the settler colonial state engaging in regular, they've killed most of [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2901.2799999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah's leaders in this moment and still their response was restrained. You know why? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2908.16s)]
*  Because at the moment Iran and Hezbollah do not want a regional war. That's an Israeli desire. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2915.6s)]
*  They want a regional war so that they could perpetuate the genocide, get an American green [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2921.36s)]
*  light for even greater weapons shipments to them, greater financial support for them. They want to [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2926.08s)]
*  unleash a full war machine and drag the region into permanent long-term war. That is a horrific [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2932.8s)]
*  outcome, but it's the outcome that they want and through that outcome Netanyahu can stay in power, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2941.04s)]
*  Ben Gver and Smotrich can realize their messianic and pursue their messianic visions. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2946.56s)]
*  And the whole region then is dragged into the abyss. This is objective. Now the Iranians have [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2952.32s)]
*  not played that game for a variety of reasons. They know that their actual military power is limited. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2960.1600000000003s)]
*  They know that also their financial power is limited. That does not mean they're powerless [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2967.04s)]
*  by the way. You know it is a major country in this region. It has always played a major role [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2971.84s)]
*  and it will continue to play a major role. However it is a country that is under siege [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2979.28s)]
*  economically. It is a country that has suffered a lot from US sanctions, from US marginalization in [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2984.1600000000003s)]
*  the international system. Its relationship with the US by the way is far more complicated than [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2991.36s)]
*  than just being reduced to the Palestinian cause or the you know because there were there was also [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=2996.5600000000004s)]
*  an Iranian cause in relation to the US. That's why the Iranian revolution happened. You know there [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3002.0s)]
*  was a problem with the US dominating Iran carrying out a coup against democratic forces there, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3006.3199999999997s)]
*  bringing in the Shah and the security state. It's a long history. Yet another instance where more [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3011.52s)]
*  moderate secular forces or more moderate and even dare I say social democratic or socialist forces [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3017.52s)]
*  were gutted for their movements and then of course what took its place was significantly [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3025.4399999999996s)]
*  more conservative forces in its stead. Yeah, Mossad Daq was a good example. He was you know [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3032.88s)]
*  a secular social democratic figure that won a popular election and his only crime was that he [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3040.0s)]
*  was trying to say Iran's natural resources have to serve the Iranian people and you know they [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3046.4s)]
*  are moving and they ensure then that there's dictatorial rule by the Shah. Oh by the way if [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3053.84s)]
*  you notice now his son is coming out on the USC and you know using the Israel brand to make [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3059.6s)]
*  inroads into the Republican party and they're parading him around everywhere. It is really [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3066.08s)]
*  an interesting collusion that's taking place between the two very conservative forces in [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3071.36s)]
*  the region. The force of Zionism and the force of this Shah's successor. But in any case what [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3077.12s)]
*  we're seeing here Hassan and again I don't think people should think of this as I have to be pro [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3083.92s)]
*  Hezbollah or pro Iran or pro anything or anti anything in this part of the world. I think what [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3090.4s)]
*  we need to think about is structural realities. Structural reality number one is that there is a [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3096.64s)]
*  settler colonial order that regardless of who leads it or who is opposed to it you know in terms [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3102.48s)]
*  of ideology or political affiliation the structure determines much more is much more relevant. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3109.2s)]
*  So we have to understand this there's a settler colonial order here it will always behave in a [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3116.72s)]
*  settler colonial ways because what settler colonialism is and we keep on saying this term [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3122.3999999999996s)]
*  but let's let's let's specify what it is. There were there there were people living in that land [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3127.8399999999997s)]
*  before another group comes in from outside in this case mainly Eastern Europe it comes in shows up [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3132.3999999999996s)]
*  and says it's no longer your land I'm going to expel you and then the whole region has to deal [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3138.96s)]
*  with that. Okay this group also expects then that that nobody should attack it for expelling these [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3143.52s)]
*  people or oppressing it or killing it and if decides to annihilate the indigenous population [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3149.68s)]
*  as it's trying to do in Gaza today then everybody's meant to be silent all right. That's [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3155.36s)]
*  not going to work okay. Secondly the second geopolitical structural reality is that [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3161.6s)]
*  there is a history to the the settler colonial behavior that is that is that has affected the [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3170.16s)]
*  region as a whole but it's also a history that intersects with the American entry into the region [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3175.28s)]
*  okay so the settler colonial state fought multiple wars with almost every neighbor [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3181.36s)]
*  actually not almost it fought multiple wars with every neighbor so it has it has fought wars against [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3187.2000000000003s)]
*  Egypt killed a lot of Egyptians and these were major wars of aggression. No you don't understand [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3193.1200000000003s)]
*  they were the victims in all of that. Of course in 1956 when they conspired with the British and the [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3197.76s)]
*  French to invade Egypt and and and take away Sinai and march to Cairo even you know that's that's [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3203.84s)]
*  there were the victims in 1948 when they were these Zionist militias were expelling people from [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3210.2400000000002s)]
*  their homes and and and basically ethnically cleansing the whole of Palestine they were victims [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3215.68s)]
*  and they say oh invading Arab armies where we're fighting against it. No you weren't you're fighting [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3221.44s)]
*  actually against the Palestinian people and did not want anybody to defend that people. Yeah it [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3227.68s)]
*  was interesting because there was no there was no armies in Derya Sin it was just the only army [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3232.72s)]
*  presence I guess was the terrorist militias that that came in and and committed atrocities against [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3238.64s)]
*  the civilian villagers that had had actual peace pacts with the Israeli villages in the region [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3246.0s)]
*  as a matter of fact that were that were a part of the plan. Right up till May 15 1948 there wasn't a [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3252.96s)]
*  single Arab army in the whole region okay and it was basically Palestinian villages being attacked [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3259.92s)]
*  and ethnically cleansed for for for for no less than six months and they had actually emptied out [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3265.52s)]
*  most of the main cities during that period by the way Haifa was ethnically cleansed before the any [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3271.84s)]
*  single Arab army entered Yaffa the same thing these were the major most most important Arab cities. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3278.32s)]
*  We can go on and on about this Hassan but the main point to emphasize here is a this settler [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3284.8s)]
*  colony group is not a victim group okay it it it is very much in the Middle Eastern context [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3290.48s)]
*  using using policies of aggression it refers sometimes to the legitimate history of Jewish [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3297.12s)]
*  oppression and victimhood in Europe in order to cover up for these crimes which is actually [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3304.48s)]
*  terrible that they're doing that they should not be referring to that history in the in this in this [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3310.72s)]
*  way and now the the additional thing to to note here is that what about Palestinians what about [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3315.44s)]
*  Palestinians what about the the Arabs next door what about the Iranians and everybody else in the [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3322.0s)]
*  in the region that has suffered from this project we don't talk about that that the whole region [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3326.96s)]
*  rejected the partition of Palestine by the way partition plan is a misnomer it should be called [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3332.7200000000003s)]
*  the setting up of a settler colonial state in Palestine that's the real you know what really [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3337.28s)]
*  happened then but every state in the region had actually rejected that including all the Arab [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3342.0s)]
*  states including Turkey including Iran they all understood what it meant meant the disaster meant [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3347.92s)]
*  the disaster and now we have to actually work on finding a common future beyond this disaster that [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3353.28s)]
*  took place there has to be especially after this genocide we have to rethink everything all the [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3360.88s)]
*  main precepts have to be rethought we have to be to imagine a future of justice and equality for [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3368.8s)]
*  everyone a future in which Jews and Arabs of all religious denominations and Iranians and Turks and [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3374.5600000000004s)]
*  and Kurds and and and Armenians everybody in this region everybody in this region can find a way [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3384.0s)]
*  beyond the the ethnic tensions and and religious tensions that are that are encouraged [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3390.7999999999997s)]
*  by this very violent settler colonial regime by the way I'm not saying that this region does not [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3398.48s)]
*  have problems of its own that that that preceded the arrival of the settler colonists of course it [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3404.64s)]
*  did every part of the world has has internal strife every part of the world has serious [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3409.2s)]
*  problems however the impact of settler colonialism has been horrendous and today we're seeing it [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3414.3199999999997s)]
*  they're trying to drag the region into a war Iran has said multiple times we don't want to get [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3420.56s)]
*  dragged into the war even the Iranian president this time after this strike he just said that [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3425.2s)]
*  you know they don't want war they want in fact de-escalation you know they want the genocide to [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3430.0s)]

*  spreading terror and wreaking havoc will not work in the long run and will not work even in the [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3709.04s)]
*  short run you cannot kill causes you cannot kill causes by killing leaders there will there will [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3716.0s)]
*  be other leaders that will come up I mean the history of Hezbollah is a good example but also [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNGvEIK15wg&t=3722.32s)]
