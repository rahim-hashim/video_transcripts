# The U.S. Is Falling Behind | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk)
*  All of it is born out of deregulation. If we held our regulatory agencies of the same standard as the European marketplace, we could create more competitive products. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=0.0s)]
*  We could also heavily subsidize certain industries to become the dominant force in the same way that China does. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=9.8s)]
*  Alright, let's watch what Donald Trump had to say about the EU. He says it was formed to screw the United States. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=16.0s)]
*  On the EU tariffs, Mr. President, have you made a decision on what level you will seek on tariffs in the European Union? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=28.0s)]
*  We have made a decision. We'll be announcing it very soon. And it'll be 25%, generally speaking. And it'll be on cars and all other things. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=34.0s)]
*  The European Union is a different case than Canada, a different kind of case. They've really taken advantage of us in a different way. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=46.0s)]
*  They don't accept our cars. They don't accept essentially our farm products. They use all sorts of reasons why not. And we accept everything of them. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=52.0s)]
*  Okay, hear me out. The European Union despises Chinese cars. And yet they allow Chinese cars foolishly into their marketplaces until it got to a degree where the Chinese cars were directly out competing domestic manufacturing with. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=61.0s)]
*  Why is it that the EU does not allow American cars into its marketplace in the same way that they allow Chinese cars? You might be wondering this question. You might be wondering why that's the case. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=78.0s)]
*  Is it because they despise Amerifats? And they love the Chinese? No, it's because American cars are heavily deregulated. It is either illegal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=89.0s)]
*  Okay, I'll explain it to you this way. Ford F-150. Until this past year, it was the highest selling vehicle in the United States of America. This year, RAV4 by Toyota has actually passed the Ford F-150. But next year, it will probably be Ford F-150. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=104.0s)]
*  In order for someone to be able to purchase a Ford F-150 and drive it on any given average random European street, they would need a commercial driver's license. That is the most popular vehicle in the United States of America. That is before we even factor in all of the other road safety violations of the Ford F-150 is in direct violation of. Okay, no shit. Europeans don't buy our fucking cars. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=124.0s)]
*  Because our cars are ginormous. If you've ever been to Europe, you would understand that a Ford F-150, for example, the most popular car in the United States of America would not fit on the average European street. Year over year, Ford F-150 has gotten larger and larger and larger due to cafe standards. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=152.0s)]
*  To avoid pre-existing regulations, the Ford Motor Company has made the cars into ginormous trucks. And then we complain about why Europe won't buy our shit. And the same goes for food. Our health and safety standards are not up to par with the European Union. I was listening to NPR this morning where they were talking about how we're going to fix the poultry situation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=178.0s)]
*  The avian flu situation, we have to vaccinate the chicken. Okay, guess what? Ain't nobody wants to buy vaccinated gay autistic chicken. Okay, nobody wants to buy gay ass chicken. They want straight chickens that are patriotic and unvaccinated. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=205.0s)]
*  Okay, the second part of what I'm talking about, the gay and autistic stuff is a joke, obviously, but like that literally is a thing that the American government is currently thinking about in order to combat the further spread of avian flu. And it's going to remove the actual poultry that was shipped overseas because people are not going to want to buy it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=221.0s)]
*  Because you can actually hide illnesses if these if you sell vaccinated chicken, apparently. Anyway, we also have shittier food safety standards, shittier health standards. And this is a problem. We force our product on the European marketplace. Even when the European marketplace says, hey, this is like, not something that we want. All of it is born out of deregulation. If we held our regulatory agencies of the same standard as the European market, we would have to force our product to be sold. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=248.0s)]
*  If we held our regulatory agencies of the same standard as the European marketplace, we could create more competitive products. We could also heavily subsidize certain industries to become the dominant force in the same way that China does. The difference is, however, the Chinese manufacturers care about global safety standards. That's the only difference. That's it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=278.0s)]
*  America, on the other hand, is like, no, we're the big guy in the room. You buy my F-150s, even if you can't drive it on your roads. How insane. What an insane prospect. We did this to Japan back in the day. Literally. We were like, I don't give a shit. Your cars are too good. And also, they're too cheap. They're too good. They're too safe. They're too cheap. You. And because of that, we still can't even get a car. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=297.0s)]
*  In this goddamn country until it's like 25 years in the future. And in that process, we literally won, basically made it illegal for some of these vehicles to enter the American marketplace. And then also sold Japan a bunch of F-150s that can't even use. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=325.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? Isn't that crazy? Doug D is a communist now. Oh, I've seen him talk. I've watched this video. They shouldn't have sent them to us. Now we know how good they are. And I were like, crap. We got to catch up. If we let capitalism sort this out, China wins this game. All these automakers are pulling out of these pulling back on these EVs. If that's the way we want to go, then that's the way we want to go. But the Chinese EVs I've driven them. They're way ahead. They're way ahead. And they're way cheaper. And China is going to walk around and start selling these cars in the American marketplace. And then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to sell this car. I'm going to sell this car. I'm going to sell this car. I'm going to sell this car. I'm going to sell this car. I'm going to sell this car. I'm going to sell this car. I [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=345.0s)]
*  And we will put this in the other markets and start gobbling up market share and all those places, too. And pretty soon our auto industry is going to be Ford selling cars to Americans. When we eventually adopt it when we have to, will China have already succeeded? You know what I'm saying? And they will have charging stations and better technology, and yes, 100%. And that's the fear. That's the fear with with walking this back. That's the fear with the government walking it back. And that's that's why we can't just necessarily just let capitalism sort out when we have the conversation because capitalism may sort it out in a way that is not favorable for us. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=375.0s)]
*  That's the, which isn't pure capitalism or government has the ability to kind of put [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=405.0s)]
*  their finger on the scales of, of what actually is not where I thought this conversation would [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=407.56s)]
*  go. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=411.4s)]
*  I'm surprised to hear myself saying this too, but I've been thinking about this more and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=412.4s)]
*  more over the last few weeks. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=414.72s)]
*  And when you hear about Ford CEO a few months ago, how did dude, this is the classic Jim [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=415.88s)]
*  Farley equation. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=421.16s)]
*  Like Jim Farley was like, yeah, they're cooking. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=422.16s)]
*  They're cooking us an interview where he said that he drove the Xiaomi SU seven. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=426.4s)]
*  He's been driving it around and it's like, well, we're building. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=429.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=433.44s)]
*  That that's interesting. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=434.44s)]
*  I drive these Chinese living on the border. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=435.44s)]
*  You sometimes see Mexican people crossing with Chinese EVs and Hiluxes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=438.84s)]
*  Like they're trying to flex. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=442.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=443.48s)]
*  America failing is good though. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=445.24s)]
*  Not necessarily because it causes a lot of heartache to Americans. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=446.68s)]
*  It's not like the billionaires and millionaires and then fixing inequality in the United States [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=450.72s)]
*  of America or significantly reducing our military presence around the globe. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=456.36s)]
*  It's not doing any of the good things. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=461.52s)]
*  America is basically collapsing. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=464.0s)]
*  And while it's collapsing, it's going to take out the entire world with it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=465.88s)]
*  We are the, the, we're the spoiled kid on the block who goes, Oh, I can't, I lost this [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=469.84s)]
*  board game. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=476.2s)]
*  I'm flipping the fucking table. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=477.2s)]
*  Empires don't die quietly. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=479.08s)]
*  We have about a $300 billion deficit with the European union. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=481.24s)]
*  I love the countries of Europe. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=484.88s)]
*  I guess I'm from there at some point, a long time ago, right? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  But indirectly, pretty directly too, I guess. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  But I love the countries of Europe. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=496.4s)]
*  I love all countries, frankly, all different, but European Union's been, it was formed [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  in order to screw the United States. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, look, let's be honest. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  The European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  That's the purpose of it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  And they've done a good job of it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  But now I'm president. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  What will happen if these countries or the EU retaliate? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=514.5200000000001s)]
*  They can't. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=518.0s)]
*  I mean, they can try, but they can't. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=519.0s)]
*  China did. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=520.88s)]
*  They imposed tariffs that are, went into effect. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=521.88s)]
*  China's retaliatory tariffs on the 10th of February. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=524.1600000000001s)]
*  Has there been any impact that you've been able to observe? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=526.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=528.44s)]
*  No, they can do it and they can try, but the numbers can never equal what ours because [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=529.44s)]
*  we could go off. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=534.6s)]
*  We are the pot of gold. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  We're the one that everybody wants and they can retaliate, but it cannot be a successful [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=537.1600000000001s)]
*  retaliation because we just go cold turkey. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't buy anymore. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=546.16s)]
*  And if that happens, we win. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=547.16s)]
*  Are you talking to Eric Prince about privatization, privatizing deportations? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=549.16s)]
*  What concessions would you like to see? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=553.16s)]
*  Oh, I don't want to start right now, but I can tell you that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=556.16s)]
*  I don't want to talk about that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=559.16s)]
*  NATO you can forget about. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=561.16s)]
*  That's been, I think that's probably the reason the whole thing started. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=562.88s)]
*  And I think JD, we can say that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=566.5999999999999s)]
*  Do you have a statement on that? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=569.5999999999999s)]
*  You've been very much involved. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=570.88s)]
*  I gave him the beauty. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=573.4s)]
*  Great. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=574.4s)]
*  Gave me the hardest question, sir. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=575.4s)]
*  I mean, look, as the president said, we're not going to do the negotiation in public [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=576.4s)]
*  with the American media. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=580.88s)]
*  He's going to do it in private with the president of Russia, with the president of Ukraine and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=581.88s)]
*  with other leaders. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=587.36s)]
*  And I think that's how this has to go. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=588.36s)]
*  I think that I just want to push back against some of the criticism I've seen in the administration [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=590.4s)]
*  on this because every single time the president engages in diplomacy, you guys preemptively [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=594.88s)]
*  accuse him of conceding to Russia. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  He hasn't conceded anything to anyone. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=603.0s)]
*  He's doing the job of a diplomat. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=605.08s)]
*  And he is of course, the diplomat in chief as the president of the United States. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, as a long standing advocate for demanding to the Biden administration, come to the table [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=611.48s)]
*  with Russia and implement a ceasefire conditional ceasefire agreement. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=616.76s)]
*  I have to admit Donald Trump is definitely going a little bit above and beyond in terms [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=620.84s)]
*  of concessions. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=628.28s)]
*  Come on, be for fucking real dude. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=629.52s)]
*  Donald Trump has all the power to control Israel. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=631.8s)]
*  And I feel like he's, he's in the beginning when they were forcing for a ceasefire, he [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=635.64s)]
*  was more critical of Israel than he is with Russia. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  And we know his ass loves Israel. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  Like in terms of the expectations and in terms of the expectations, like him forcing Israel's [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=645.24s)]
*  hand into a conditional ceasefire agreement was on ironically a little bit unexpected. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=649.8s)]
*  In this situation with Russia, the way the ways in which he is talking about the situation [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=657.3s)]
*  is certainly going way above and way beyond my expectation. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=663.02s)]
*  It's a shocking level of glazing Krasnop proof in the article, by the way, I can't tell if [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=670.12s)]

*  No, I want to see if we make a deal first, but I think we will. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1070.5400000000002s)]
*  But is it a bargaining chip? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1073.5s)]
*  I've had very good conversations with president Putin. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1074.5s)]
*  I've had very good conversations with presidents Elinsky. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1077.62s)]
*  And until four weeks ago, nobody had conversations with anybody. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1082.34s)]
*  It wasn't even a consideration. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1086.8999999999999s)]
*  Nobody thought you could make peace. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1088.78s)]
*  I think you can. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1089.78s)]
*  But if Mr. Putin gets to keep his land that was claimed by force, if the Russians get [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1090.78s)]
*  to keep the territory that they they claim by force, doesn't that send a dangerous message, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1095.6599999999999s)]
*  let's say to China about Taiwan? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1100.3s)]
*  You try and take it away. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1102.3s)]
*  We're going to, we're going to do the best we can. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1103.3s)]
*  We're going to do the best we can to make the best deal we can from both sides. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1105.3s)]
*  But for Ukraine, we're going to try very hard to make a good deal so that they can [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1110.46s)]
*  get as much back as possible. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1115.5s)]
*  We want to get as much back as possible. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1117.06s)]
*  Mr. President, just to bring this full. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1119.94s)]
*  We'll cut it out after maybe this question. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1120.94s)]
*  To bring this full circle back to back to a question. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1123.62s)]
*  You always like to finish on a good question. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1127.58s)]
*  Sir, they wish to negotiate with them instead of president Putin. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1129.06s)]
*  Back to a question about these. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1132.78s)]
*  Peacekeepers. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1134.46s)]
*  You have a lot of confidence in us because you assume there's going to be peace. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1135.46s)]
*  You know, it's possible it doesn't work out. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1139.54s)]
*  There is possibility. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1141.54s)]
*  I had a question. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1142.54s)]
*  For the sake of humanity, because if you look at the pictures that I've looked at, you [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1143.54s)]
*  don't want to look at them. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1149.42s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1150.42s)]
*  I had a question back on these cuts to the federal workforce. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1151.42s)]
*  You mentioned you you're interested in doing another round of this. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZfBmZCfdhk&t=1153.42s)]
