# Tim Walz Rally In Superior, Wisconsin | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk)
*  He understands that. I think it's pretty crazy that his like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=0.0s)]
*  rhetoricals are being wasted on like advocating for the ACA [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=3.66s)]
*  instead of imagining and advocating for a better future [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=8.22s)]
*  for all Americans with progressive policy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  With it friends. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=13.8s)]
*  Let's see what Timmy boy has to say in Wisconsin. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=20.1s)]
*  Not his makeup, but his character. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=23.66s)]
*  Do you think this will push public sentiment? Probably not. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=26.3s)]
*  I think public sentiment is already there. What more public [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=29.1s)]
*  sentiment needs to be pushed? How many more can polls do we [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=32.22s)]
*  need to look at on this broadcast alone to recognize that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=35.18s)]
*  like, you know, there are enough Americans who are definitely [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=39.0s)]
*  like whether they are completely paying attention or not doesn't [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  matter. Obviously there are a ton of Americans who agree with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=47.42s)]
*  the reality that this is unconscionable. Like what's the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  number there is not like everyone's on the same page. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  Everyone's on board with the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=58.1s)]
*  what do you want it to be like 90% it's already like as close [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=67.9s)]
*  to 90% as you can get. There's always going to be some [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  psychos. There's like going to be the Republican evangelical [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=75.26s)]
*  Christians that obviously will never get on board because they [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=79.1s)]
*  have like a psychopathic approach to the matter. They [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=82.66s)]
*  personally have the theological justifications for why Israel [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=86.46s)]
*  must do death and destruction. I am going to turn on the audio in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=90.02s)]
*  a moment. Okay, shut the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=94.1s)]
*  up. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  It was they started a small business of bakery that's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=96.74s)]
*  creating jobs and growing the economy right there in wassup. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  And when I told them that Vice President Harris had no problem [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=102.33999999999999s)]
*  answering that and I have no problem answering that. And [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=105.5s)]
*  people who love this democracy and understand we stand with our [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=108.46s)]
*  friends. It's a very simple question. Ukraine must win that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=111.02s)]
*  and push the aggressors back. He also had another easy one. He [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  refused to answer if he would sign veto a national abortion [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  ban wouldn't answer it. Well, you know why? You know why all [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=122.66s)]
*  of a sudden now he says he's he's all for the support or [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  whatever. Here's the deal. He doesn't trust women and they [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=129.66s)]
*  sure the hell don't trust him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=133.22s)]
*  Oh, it bricked it couldn't handle the Midwestern charisma. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=134.54s)]
*  What are you eating big man? I'm eating what I eat all the time [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=144.78s)]
*  with just chicken. The question and the the question is always [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=148.1s)]
*  the same at this hour. And the answer is always the same. I've [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=151.7s)]
*  eaten it. I've eaten chicken every single every single day. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=155.06s)]
*  For the past, I guess at this point, it's been how many years [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=160.22s)]
*  like six years? I don't know why it's not working. I don't [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=163.22s)]
*  know why it's busted us to become the frog in the slowly [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=166.78s)]
*  boiling water to pretend like that's any way normal or okay. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=169.7s)]
*  Say it every single day. He lost the election. He's trying to lie [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=173.46s)]
*  about it. And he will do so again. But he says all of you [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=178.02s)]
*  are just AI. So he's not too worried about it. Your votes [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=180.98s)]
*  won't be AI. I guarantee you that. But with all the bluster, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=183.7s)]
*  all the misinformation, all the inability to stand on the core [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=188.9s)]
*  values that makes America the great country it is. He also had [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=192.14s)]
*  nothing to say what he would do to make your lives better. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  Nothing. Healthcare plan. Remember, came down those golden [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=200.01999999999998s)]
*  escalator nine years ago, got asked about Obamacare. I'll rip [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=204.14s)]
*  it out of a better plan on day one. Nine years ago, what we saw [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=207.66s)]
*  Tuesday night is look, he apparently has been doing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=212.45999999999998s)]
*  something. He has the concepts of a plan. And as I said this, if [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=215.61999999999998s)]
*  I got that excuse from one of my students, I would have left [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=219.9s)]
*  them out of the room for that. No, no, try better. Try better. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=223.22s)]
*  Look, for him, for him, it's a sound bite. It's nothing. For [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=227.46s)]
*  you. It's the pre existing condition you had in your [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=231.86s)]
*  insurance company wouldn't pay the bill means now you can go [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  get treated. You can take your children in. You can't be [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=237.1s)]
*  discriminated against. We can get checkups on time and prevent [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=240.5s)]
*  illnesses down the road. The ACA has provided millions of people [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=245.34s)]
*  a healthier, better, freer life for them and their children. For [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  him, it's a talking point. Let's just be honest. He doesn't know [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=252.86s)]
*  what's in the ACA. He's never read it. He never looked at he [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=256.18s)]
*  doesn't know. Not once did he ever worry that he would have to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=259.5s)]
*  pay a medical bill. They're out of touch with who we are. Kamala [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=263.82s)]
*  Harris, who grew up in that middle class family around a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=269.5s)]
*  kitchen table, you have to decide how you're going to pay [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  the bills with her single mom. She understands that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=274.74s)]
*  I think it's pretty crazy that his like rhetoricals are being [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=278.18s)]
*  wasted on like, advocating for the ACA instead of imagining and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=281.7s)]
*  advocating for a better future for all Americans with [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=286.74s)]
*  progressive policy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=289.26s)]
*  With friends, neighbors, family. Oh, I like Donald Trump. You [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=290.86s)]
*  know, I don't really like how he swears and gets convicted of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=294.26s)]
*  felonies and found liable for assaulting women. I don't really [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=297.97999999999996s)]
*  like that. Good. I'm glad you don't like that. But then they [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=302.18s)]
*  always go I like his proposals, which one taking your health [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=305.66s)]
*  care, forcing women to bleed out in parking lots because they [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=309.54s)]
*  can't get health care, tax cuts for billionaires. And I say [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=313.5s)]
*  this, if you're a billionaire, and that's all you care about, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=317.94000000000005s)]
*  he may be your guy. But if you're a working class person, a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=322.54s)]
*  middle class person, a community member, I can't find much there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=326.18s)]
*  And the thing is, you don't have to look very far. He's not [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=329.94000000000005s)]
*  giving you much detail. Except it's really great. They made it [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=331.98s)]
*  easy for us. They printed 900 plus pages in project 2025. Are [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=334.98s)]
*  you watching this? They're all mad as hell at the guys who wrote [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=339.06s)]
*  this now because it got out there. This was the thing. She [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=342.70000000000005s)]
*  said the quiet stuff out loud before we got elected. Yes, they [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=344.82s)]
*  did. No one wants that agenda. No one who's not a billionaire [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=348.54s)]
*  wants that agenda. No one wants government in your bedrooms in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=353.86s)]
*  your exam rooms. No one wants to make drugs more expensive. No [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=358.06s)]
*  one wants to avoid dealing with climate change or making prices [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=362.74s)]
*  more affordable for folks in the middle that we're trying to do. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=366.18s)]
*  They have no idea about any of those things. So look, these [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=369.62s)]
*  guys on the other side, you know what they stand for. Here's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  what I'm most proud of. I'm proud with our side of things. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=377.7s)]
*  While Donald Trump spent his time whining, crying, grievance [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=381.02s)]
*  filled, oh, they did me wrong. They did me wrong. It's difficult [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=386.02s)]
*  to be born with millions of dollars. It's difficult to not [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=389.5s)]
*  pay your bills. It's difficult to have the Supreme Court say you [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=392.5s)]
*  can do whatever the hell you want with no consequence. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=395.5s)]
*  Apparently, that's difficult for him. Kamala Harris spent no [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=397.74s)]
*  time doing that. She talked about you and she talked about [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=400.58s)]
*  the future. She talked about and again, I don't know if my [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=403.62s)]
*  English teacher wife would enjoy that I'm going there. Another [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=406.82s)]
*  pun. She prosecuted the case really well on Tuesday. So but [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=411.02s)]
*  you know what you also saw? You saw this and you're here and I [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=415.98s)]
*  see it looking out at each one of you. This is hard, important [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=419.86s)]
*  work. This is difficult work. This will shape generations to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=423.94s)]
*  come. But hard work can be good work and hard work can be joyful [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=428.22s)]
*  work. And that's what she did. She brought joy back to the idea [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=432.5s)]
*  of politics, an idea that it can be better, bigger than just one [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=436.22s)]
*  of us. In her in her entire professional career, she's had [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=440.3s)]
*  one client, the people, the people. And she says this in her [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=445.66s)]
*  entire career, prosecutor, attorney general, senator, vice [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=450.06s)]
*  president. She never asked Democrat or Republican. She [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=452.98s)]
*  asked, Are you okay? And what can we do to make things better? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=456.26s)]
*  So look, we were in Pennsylvania on this bus tour. This was really [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=460.62s)]
*  great. We old school we're getting on these buses and we're [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=463.82s)]
*  going into red areas and we're talking to anybody who's out [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=466.18s)]
*  there. Because look, let's just be honest, and she knows this [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=468.74s)]
*  better than anybody. We were looking out at a crowd of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=472.1s)]
*  supporters and there was a whole bunch of our supporters with [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=474.62s)]
*  signs just like you and we're all excited and really great t [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=476.82s)]
*  shirts, by the way, up front here. And then on the other side [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=479.62s)]
*  of the street, we're folks who weren't our supporters. It's easy [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=481.94s)]
*  to tell they're all in the same hat. So I say a group of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=485.66s)]
*  independent thinkers on one side of street over there ready to go. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=488.5s)]
*  But she turned to me and it was just Gwen and I and Doug and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=492.18s)]
*  Kamala Harris. And she turned around to me and she said, Tim, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=495.1s)]
*  never forget, we fight just as hard for folks on this side of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=497.7s)]
*  the street as folks on this side of the street. That's what this [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=500.62s)]
*  is about. This is why talking to your neighbors, as Gwen said, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=502.90000000000003s)]
*  this is why the work of the next 52 days, people are undecided. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=506.5s)]
*  Look, I think it's pretty obvious. Most people don't like [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=510.1s)]
*  him. It's not if this were about having the best ideas or the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=512.86s)]
*  best candidates, I think we would win most of the elections [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=516.58s)]
*  because that's the way it usually works out. But that's [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=519.5s)]
*  not what happens. This is about hard work. It's about going out [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=521.22s)]
*  and talking to people. It's about telling them what it [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=523.86s)]
*  matters. And the things we're talking about in this room will [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=525.98s)]
*  help folks who are buying those flags, wearing that red hat and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=529.26s)]
*  believing that Donald Trump's with them. What you know is [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=534.02s)]
*  healthcare for their family, good public schools, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=537.22s)]
*  infrastructure investments, the right to control your own body, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=539.78s)]
*  all of those things. If you ask them and talk to them as [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=543.46s)]
*  neighbors, they're going to say, yeah, I'm for that. Then you [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=547.0600000000001s)]
*  need to remind them he's against all of that. He's against all of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=549.46s)]
*  that. So look, as that prosecutor, she had to take on [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=552.58s)]
*  predators, fraudsters, people trying to cheat you, career [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=556.74s)]
*  criminals, big corporate interests who think they're above [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=560.1s)]
*  the law. Now, it was easier the other night because all of those [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=563.14s)]
*  things were wrapped into one person. So you can take it on. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=567.46s)]
*  But but but the fight was there. The idea, the idea that we lay [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=570.18s)]
*  out a plan, an opportunity economy plan, one that knows [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=576.3s)]
*  because she grew up in the middle class, she knows that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=580.34s)]
*  it's not enough to get by. We've all been there. It's not [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=583.54s)]
*  enough to get by. People want to get ahead and thrive. And in [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=586.38s)]
*  this country, the richest country in the world, there is [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=590.46s)]
*  no reason that the gap between the CEOs and the folks who are [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=593.58s)]
*  doing the work, the labor that's doing the work. She is so the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=597.98s)]
*  most basic. It's so good. This is he is such a good order, man. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=603.3s)]
*  Just fine. But you don't need $40 million when people are just [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=608.34s)]
*  so goddamn charismatic. And it's such a waste to have him up [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=613.2199999999999s)]
*  there. Talking about Kamala Harris is $50,000 for startups [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=618.98s)]
*  or whatever. She wants to make homes more affordable. Because [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=626.5s)]
*  you know why? Of course he's better than Harris. Come on. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=631.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yes. To buy that house. I watched my mom worry after my [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=634.9399999999999s)]
*  dad died in the medical bills there. Will I be able to keep [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=639.9s)]
*  my house for those guys? A Wall Street guy? A six time bankruptcy [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=643.06s)]
*  guy, a venture capitalist guy? Those are just commodities [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=648.86s)]
*  trading. If it means foreclosing on somebody do that if it makes [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=653.98s)]
*  you money, who cares. But those are our neighbors. Kamala Harris [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=657.18s)]
*  understands that home is the foundation to families and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=660.6999999999999s)]
*  community. That's why she wants to make it easier through down [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=663.9399999999999s)]
*  payments, helping builders create 3 million more new homes [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=667.1s)]
*  and working with local folks to make it easier to get those [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=670.34s)]
*  homes built in per minute. That's right. And when she she [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=673.1800000000001s)]
*  talked about prices and price gouging, it was fascinating to [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=676.4200000000001s)]
*  me to watch how fast Donald Trump and his running mate jumped [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=680.82s)]
*  on to defend price gouging. Look, 37 states already have laws [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=684.86s)]
*  against that. But the thing that really gets me is we're trying [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=688.7s)]
*  and figuring out how to keep prices lower. Our farmers are [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  working dawn till dusk, and they're getting 390 a bushel for [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=696.78s)]
*  corn and 10 bucks for soybeans. They're not getting rich. They [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=701.5799999999999s)]
*  didn't grow the food. They didn't process it at the factory [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=705.22s)]
*  where labor did that. Somebody's pulling off a chunk of money out [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=708.54s)]
*  there that has nothing to do with getting that to you. That's [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=712.3s)]
*  what she's talking about. If you're jacking up the price [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=714.8199999999999s)]
*  illegally, you should stop that. And and one of the American [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=717.3399999999999s)]
*  dreams is to choose your path. And none of those paths should be [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=721.06s)]
*  closed out the idea. If you've got an idea for a small business, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=724.58s)]
*  it should be easier to start that small business. That's why [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=727.5s)]
*  she proposed increasing the tax credit so you can get up and off [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=729.98s)]
*  the ground, making sure then that you've got health care so [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=733.38s)]
*  that that doesn't drive you out of a small business, and then [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=736.1s)]
*  making sure your neighbors are being paid enough that they can [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=738.7800000000001s)]
*  actually spend money at your small business and everybody [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=742.1s)]
*  thrive. Look, I know you've got it here. This is the part this [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=744.86s)]
*  ability to be able to collectively bargain and [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=748.74s)]
*  organize. Let's not forget our history America, the labor [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=750.58s)]
*  movement starts in Wisconsin. It's Wisconsin. So the idea of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=753.94s)]
*  investing back to the middle class, the idea of growing from [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=759.2600000000001s)]
*  the inside out the idea that everybody can have a place in [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=762.7s)]
*  this. We have a Minnesota saying from one of our senators who we [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=765.82s)]
*  lost way too soon, who says we all do better when we all do [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=769.74s)]
*  better. It's not that complicated. It's not that [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=773.2600000000001s)]
*  complicated. But these guys figure out a way we want more [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=776.1800000000001s)]
*  and more and more and more more tax. I will say this about [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=779.74s)]
*  Donald Trump. He was very clear on one thing and he followed [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=783.02s)]
*  through with this. He told the billionaires he was going to [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=785.58s)]
*  give them a tax cut and he did it. Project 2025 promises you [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=787.94s)]
*  again, he will do it again and bigger. So let's be very clear [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=791.58s)]
*  when he does that, it cuts out opportunities for all the rest [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=794.9s)]
*  of us. When they do that, it undermines our ability to do the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=797.9s)]
*  things we know need to be done. So just to be clear and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=800.94s)]
*  something you know about right here in Superior in Duluth, that [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=803.26s)]
*  Donald Trump talked a tough game about infrastructure, Kamala [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=806.34s)]
*  Harris got it done. By the way, that Blotnick Bridge is built by [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=809.26s)]
*  all of us. That's the guy who is trying to figure out how to not [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=812.5s)]
*  pay his damn taxes so that he doesn't have to fix it. All of [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=814.74s)]
*  us understand that bridge creates economic opportunity, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=817.7800000000001s)]
*  connecting us together both physically and as a people. It [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=820.7800000000001s)]
*  makes good sense. And I'll tell you, you saw it. You saw this [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=824.4200000000001s)]
*  idea about freedom. And you've seen it's really great. It's not [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=827.74s)]
*  just a song that the vice president comes out to, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=831.74s)]
*  although that's really cool when she does that. But you saw it [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=833.58s)]
*  in Chicago and you're talking about this, this idea of [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=836.7s)]
*  freedom. The idea of what it means, freedom to live your life [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=838.86s)]
*  the way you choose to live your life. Some of us are old enough [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=843.34s)]
*  to remember. Republicans used to talk like that too. They used to [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=846.4200000000001s)]
*  talk about freedom. They would have never turned their back on [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=850.0200000000001s)]
*  an ally. They would have never decided that they needed to be [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=852.74s)]
*  in your business. But we know now they want the freedom to be [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=855.86s)]
*  in your doctor's office. By the way, Project 2025, for some of [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=859.5400000000001s)]
*  you want to know in there, they've got a national pregnancy [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=863.46s)]
*  coordinator that tracks all pregnancies. That seemed like [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=866.62s)]
*  too crazy for George Orwell to put in his book, but they did it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=869.3s)]
*  They did it. Look, they want to be in your school library. I [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=872.66s)]
*  don't know about you, but you heard Isabella talk about it. In [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=876.02s)]
*  Minnesota, while those guys are figuring out how to ban books, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=879.02s)]
*  we're banishing hunger from our schools. That's a big, big [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=883.34s)]
*  difference. And again, I'm gonna go back to those old school [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=886.42s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=889.66s)]
*  You talk about banning the top of the hour ad break, which comes [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=890.5s)]
*  to the top of every hour. If you no longer want to see it, all [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=893.34s)]
*  you need to do is subscribe. For $6 or for free. Here's the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=895.86s)]
*  three minute ad break now. Which prom is free folks. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=899.62s)]
*  But the personal choices and the personal freedoms, we respect it. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=903.14s)]
*  We respect it. We may not agree with it. We may not agree with [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=908.1s)]
*  that. Look, I get it. There's some of you choose the Packers [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=911.54s)]
*  over the Vikings. That's your choice. Your choice. Oh, give it [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=915.38s)]
*  to me. Give me my give me my moment. Give me my moment. We [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=919.02s)]
*  don't have any Super Bowl rings. Just give me the moment. Well, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=923.38s)]
*  look, we may not agree and we may differ. But you've heard me [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=926.74s)]
*  say it. And I know it's a Wisconsin rule. I claimed it for [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=930.66s)]
*  Minnesota. But I know you've got it here too. The golden rule that [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=932.98s)]

*  on Wall Street, why would you care if the social security check [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=1158.3s)]
*  shows up? You don't care about it because you don't need it. So [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=1161.82s)]
*  you're looking for the tax cut. Well, I'll tell you who does [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=1164.38s)]

*  actually eating, like stealing people's domestic pets and [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=1234.38s)]
*  eating them. That would constitute some level of an [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKzVagA1NRk&t=1238.3s)]
