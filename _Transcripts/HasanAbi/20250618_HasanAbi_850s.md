# Why China REFUSES To Defend Iran | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0)
*  or by directly the Iranian state with the hopes that they can destabilize it so that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=0.0s)]
*  they can't be a reliable energy provider to China in general. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=9.24s)]
*  So this isn't like Chinese defense of Iran in this circumstance would be an act of self-defense. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=13.88s)]
*  If America's unlimited support to Israel is a defense of American interests in the region, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=20.88s)]
*  what is up with China? Why is China not played a prominent role in this despite its connection [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=28.12s)]
*  to Iran as an energy provider? Iran is an energy provider for China. Obviously they [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=38.24s)]
*  have a long-standing energy deal with Iran and some people's response to this on Twitter [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  funny. I saw there was the one guy who's like an anti-imperialist Chinese national, I think, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=54.84s)]
*  but I don't know if he actually lives in America or not. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=62.64s)]
*  And he was like, you don't understand China has to do trade. Like he tried to frame it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=65.2s)]
*  from like a Radlib perspective, which I thought was very funny. Let me see. I mean, I retweeted [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=70.2s)]
*  this as a joke because this was a very funny, it was like a not potato Bolshevik says if [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  China doesn't trade with someone for 10 minutes, they will explode. They need to trade. You [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=81.22s)]
*  don't get it. And that was someone find the original Carl's I think Carl's. Yeah. Do you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=84.9s)]
*  have that tweet? Can someone send me the original tweet that kickstarted this discourse? I thought [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=90.94s)]
*  it was really funny. It basically was doing like he was trying to do like a standpoint [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  but for the Chinese state, which is a hegemonic superpower at this point. Oh here. This is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=105.58s)]
*  it. Tiberius says China will never be the world's dominant power. If it thinks neutrality [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=112.98s)]
*  during a giant fight and attacks on a sovereign nation, it considers an ally is somehow leadership. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=116.9s)]
*  Carl's I'll response. Maybe people need to consider the possibility that China doesn't [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=121.66s)]
*  want to be the world's dominant power. China is not seeking to supplant the U S as the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=125.9s)]
*  global cop. China's goal is always the development of the wellbeing of Chinese people. You know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=129.86s)]
*  bilateral sanctions on Israel won't work because the West will supply whatever Israel needs. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=134.78s)]
*  So it will just be empty virtue signaling. Did Iran ask China for help in the current [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=138.82000000000002s)]
*  conflict trying to certainly not responsible for the impotence of those who live in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=142.86s)]
*  imperial core yet can affect meaningful changes in their own government's behavior. China [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=146.58s)]
*  is not going to destroy the U S empire for you. Chinese people don't owe you anything. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=151.06s)]
*  Now this is a hilarious post in my opinion, because as, as you know, China lovers in the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=156.42s)]
*  Western world, people are not going to China, please China, please save us. Okay. Maybe [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=166.45999999999998s)]
*  some people are, but I think that there is a reasonable analysis here for there's a reasonable [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=172.33999999999997s)]
*  analysis beyond like, why won't China do anything that we can't do here in the Western world? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  The question is, why doesn't China do anything for its own interests in the region? Iran [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  provides between one third or half as for China. They don't want to declare support [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=196.52s)]
*  fine, but they must provide covert support. At least the overwhelm is really missile defense [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=200.84s)]
*  for the time being. Yeah. It's just like if Iran falls, I mean, the reason for why Iran [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=204.24s)]
*  must fall from the Western perspective is literally so they can move on to China. Okay. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=210.0s)]
*  Either bringing Iran through diplomacy into the banner of Western interests under the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=217.72s)]
*  umbrella of Western interests, which is not super likely, but who knows because the Ayatollah [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  has been very, very restrained or, or by directly the Iranian state with the hopes that they [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=233.72s)]
*  can destabilize it so that they can't be a reliable energy provider to China in general. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=243.92s)]
*  So this isn't like Chinese defense of Iran in this circumstance would be an act of self [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=249.8s)]
*  defense. If America's unlimited support to Israel is a defense of American interests in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=255.76s)]
*  the region, then Chinese defense of Iran would be an act of self-defense for China's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=261.84s)]
*  interests in the region. Here is Arno Bertrand, who is another, you know, G writer whose [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=269.44s)]
*  analysis I think is interesting. And I, you know, often read it saying this, I keep seeing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=277.32s)]
*  scores of people saying that unless China interviews in the Middle East, it will somehow [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  be there. And meanwhile, fascinatingly, here's what Oriana Schuyler Mastro, who used to be [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=287.28s)]
*  the Pentagon's top strategic planner on China and is now a professor at Stanford has to say [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=290.28s)]
*  about it in a nutshell. She says that the U S would love nothing more than to drag China in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=295.11999999999995s)]
*  the conflicts like that with Iran. And she herself has often tried to articulate recommendations [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=299.2s)]
*  to trap China in that way. But China never takes the bait, which in her view shows that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  they're very strategically disciplined. It also reflects that the fact that China, unlike the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  U S obviously do not believe in foreign military intervention as a tool of power. They believe in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=310.84s)]
*  using political and economic tools. She asked rhetorically the Afghanistan cost equivalent of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=314.88s)]
*  10 Belt and Road initiatives. So which one is more impactful in the world? She is adamant [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  that the U S is renewed involvement in the Middle East is an unequivocal mistake. As she [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=323.44s)]
*  explains, not only will it prevent once more the mythical pivot to Asia, which is obviously [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=327.24s)]
*  in and of itself in China's interest, but it will only further deplete us resources [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=332.64s)]
*  without much to show for it in the end. Effectively, according to her, China gets exactly what [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=337.6s)]
*  they want. The U S repeatedly getting baited and exhausting itself into costly military [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=341.56s)]
*  interventions with strategic rationale. As she puts it, that's how great powers decline. In fact, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=345.32s)]
*  it's exactly the type of strategic overextension that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=350.28s)]
*  So who's right? The Twitter crowd or Pentagon Oriana. My answer to this very question in my [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=354.68s)]
*  new sub-sac article where I explain where, where I find myself surprisingly agreeing with a notorious [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=360.84s)]
*  Pentagon, China hawk. This is incorrect only because if America is depleting its resources [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=366.68s)]
*  and then they actually strike a deal with Iran that decouples around from China or destabilizes [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  Iran so thoroughly that Iran can no longer be an energy provider for China, then China's fucking [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=383.08s)]
*  cooked. There's a two front battle here for America. One to decouple China as a manufacturing hub [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=389.08s)]
*  from Western markets and whichever markets that America has commander control over. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=396.04s)]
*  And that's part of the terrorist play that Donald Trump has been implementing, which has been somewhat [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=401.72s)]
*  of a failure, right? For obvious reasons, considering that no one wants to let go of the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=406.12s)]
*  endless flow of treats that keep their populations servile, especially because it's been tremendously [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=413.24s)]
*  beneficial for Western nations to continue offering products and a sea of come. Okay. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=418.6s)]
*  And the secondary part of this is energy, energy going to China. If America basically dismantles [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  the last remaining stronghold, with the exception of Russia, that is a major energy provider to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  China. All of a sudden they can shut off the energy faucet of China. Okay. China can't let Iran fall. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=440.76s)]
*  It's that simple. I don't know how much of, I think that chatter was wrong when he said [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=449.32s)]
*  Iran supplies one third of China's oil. I think China takes one third of Iranian oil. Iran itself [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=454.84s)]
*  only takes up around 10% of Chinese energy. Like Iran delivers only 10% of Chinese oil. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=464.2s)]
*  That in turn is one third of the Iranian oil supply, I think, or even higher than that, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=471.8s)]
*  almost half. But the difference, however, is that because Iran is not in the sphere of American [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=479.08s)]
*  influence in the way that like Saudi Arabia is, this allows, this allows there to be at least [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=486.35999999999996s)]
*  some diversity within OPEC, within OPEC plus the diversity within OPEC plus comes from [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=494.11999999999995s)]
*  the obvious ultimate interest that every single OPEC plus country has, which is to maintain [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=501.96s)]
*  their oil contracts to monopolize and set the price for oil around the globe. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=509.0s)]
*  The more countries that are in the sphere of American influence, the more they can [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=522.12s)]
*  strategically make decisions to shut off the energy faucet into China. Yeah. Also 10% is still [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=529.3199999999999s)]
*  not negligible. It's not like a tiny amount of oil. Do you understand what I mean though? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=536.84s)]
*  Because ultimately it's not like Saudi Arabia and the rest of the oil providers are going to turn [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=542.36s)]
*  around and be like, they're going to, they're going to turn around and be like, okay, we're not [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=547.24s)]
*  like when there are alternatives out there, when there can be backdoor deals that, that are a [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=551.64s)]
*  order that have a higher priority for all of these countries to continue generating revenue. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=558.0400000000001s)]
*  It's the most significant form of a revenue generation for these countries. They're not [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=563.56s)]
*  going to cast that aside because America asked them to do so. They clearly didn't do so when [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=568.68s)]
*  Biden literally went to OPEC plus and demanded that they, they actually increase oil production. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=573.16s)]
*  They said, fuck off. So they clearly care a lot more about revenue generation than they do about [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=580.28s)]
*  anything else. But if they are all under the, if they are either removing a market competitor, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=584.8399999999999s)]
*  that has a lot of, of, that has shown aggression in the past against some of the other oil providers [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=594.3599999999999s)]
*  in the Gulf States, or even bring that under the banner of American influence. All of a sudden, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=604.04s)]
*  these guys all are now playing ball with one another. Therefore they would probably be more [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=611.7199999999999s)]
*  willing to, therefore they'd probably be more willing to shut off any sort of energy going to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  China and redirect it back to other markets potentially. That's the ultimate goal. I think [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=624.52s)]
*  if there's a two-prong war of, of turning China into the USSR first and foremost, so they can [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=639.4799999999999s)]
*  engage in like a more serious, direct conflict with China, they have to decouple China from global [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=645.32s)]
*  trade and dismantle China's influence. And also they have to be able to shut off China's energy. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=651.4000000000001s)]
*  And they currently can't do that with Iran being right there as an ally to China and Russia also. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=659.0s)]
*  Iran is too economically dependent on China to decouple. In my opinion, the U S can't offer the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=665.4000000000001s)]
*  same form of cheap manufacturing that Iran, China does. I don't really think, no, that's why I'm [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=669.0s)]
*  saying like they don't, they, it's not more, it's not about like destabilize, it's not about bringing [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=672.52s)]
*  China or Iran diplomatically into the sphere of American influence. That's very unlikely. And it's [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=678.68s)]
*  more so about a decapitation and destabilization of Iran, which would erode a market competitor [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=684.04s)]
*  for the Gulf States and also shut off forcibly at least 10% of Chinese energy. That's what I think. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=691.64s)]
*  Anyway, Iran is, Iran is also doing like Ansarullah style media hits now. Iran claims to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=703.16s)]
*  dismantle Israel's air defense is clearing the way for thunderous strikes. Operation Drew Promise 3 [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=709.96s)]
*  began with the launch of the super heavy long range two stage Sejil missiles. The residents of [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=714.84s)]
*  the occupied land of Quds, Jerusalem should know that the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyars3bKjk0&t=721.16s)]
