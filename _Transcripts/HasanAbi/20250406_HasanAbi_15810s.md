# Hasan And Zohran Expose The Injustice In New York City
**HasanAbi:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw)
*  Make it very clear. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=0.0s)]
*  One, two, three, four, five, and now... [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2.0s)]
*  Do not do that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4.0s)]
*  The number one thing is cost of living. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8.0s)]
*  The number one thing is to make the city affordable. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10.0s)]
*  And the number one cost in New Yorkers' life when they're thinking about that is housing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12.0s)]
*  About two and a half million New Yorkers live in rent-stabilized housing across New York City. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15.0s)]
*  You don't have to carry it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=24.0s)]
*  You have a hotel key. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=26.0s)]
*  Where is this f***ing guy? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=28.0s)]
*  Probably around the corner. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=30.0s)]
*  It's chilly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=38.0s)]
*  It's Ford Explorer. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=46.0s)]
*  He said he's waiting. Oh, he's right there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=48.0s)]
*  With the flashing lights. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=50.0s)]
*  Sorry, Chad. You're getting... [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=54.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=56.0s)]
*  Oh, I guess there's a reason for that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=58.0s)]
*  He's right. He's right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=60.0s)]
*  Probably in the front or in the back? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=68.0s)]
*  All the way in the back. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=70.0s)]
*  You want to get in from the other side? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=78.0s)]
*  Just cross over. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=80.0s)]
*  Ow. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=86.0s)]
*  What's going on, Ajmal? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=98.0s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, we're live already. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1632.0s)]
*  Can you? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1633.0s)]
*  We're early. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1634.0s)]
*  We wanted to. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1635.0s)]
*  Time to set this up in 10 minutes flat and have production. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1636.0s)]
*  Andy's yelling at me in chat. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1644.32s)]
*  Can we get this table right here so I can? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1647.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1651.28s)]
*  Oh, you want to put the camera on it? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1652.28s)]
*  This way or that way? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1654.28s)]
*  This way. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1655.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to film it in the light. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1656.56s)]
*  Is it better to film inside or? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1657.56s)]
*  I mean, we'll be blown out if we film this way. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1658.56s)]
*  Oh, true. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1660.56s)]
*  It's not too bad, but yeah, I think we set it up either way. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1661.56s)]
*  Yeah, and I think this is an interesting enough backdrop that it's fine. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1664.56s)]
*  Yeah, we're bouncing on the ceiling. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1667.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1668.56s)]
*  This is perfect. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1669.56s)]
*  And then I just, as far back over here as possible. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1670.56s)]
*  Great. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1675.56s)]

*  A lot going on. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1679.56s)]
*  Oh, no, no. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1680.56s)]
*  You can keep them open. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1681.56s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1682.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1683.56s)]
*  It's just the tripod, yeah. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1684.84s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1685.84s)]
*  This should be fine. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1686.84s)]
*  Marge, they're calling you in chat in the chat. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1687.84s)]
*  Yep, I know. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1690.84s)]
*  All while holding 30k people. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1693.84s)]
*  Hey, look at me chat. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1696.84s)]
*  You want to take a seat as well? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1699.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1704.84s)]
*  You mean like side profile? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1705.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1710.84s)]
*  I mean, you could just kind of angle inward a bit. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1711.84s)]
*  Like angle the seats inward a bit. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1714.84s)]
*  It's up to you. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1717.84s)]
*  It's up to you. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1720.84s)]

*  Okay. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1727.84s)]
*  Yeah, go for it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1728.84s)]
*  No, no, wait, hold on. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1729.84s)]
*  I'm at the seats. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1730.84s)]
*  I'll do it. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1731.84s)]
*  I think it'll actually be fine, though. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1732.84s)]
*  I think it looks good. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1733.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1734.84s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1735.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I haven't even finished this yet. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1736.84s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1737.84s)]
*  Wait, what are you doing? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1738.84s)]
*  I'm just going to put it in the camera. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1739.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1740.84s)]
*  I think it's. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1741.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1744.9599999999998s)]
*  Like that, right? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1745.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1747.4399999999998s)]
*  That's what you were thinking? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1748.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1749.4399999999998s)]
*  Like that, right? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1750.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1766.88s)]
*  That's what you were thinking? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1767.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1768.88s)]
*  And you'll kind of speak inward. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1769.88s)]
*  That's a little bit better. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1770.88s)]
*  I can punch in a bit too. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1772.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1774.8s)]
*  Alex, can you sit there for a second? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1775.8s)]
*  And then I'll crop in one sec. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1778.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is great. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1785.8s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1790.8s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1795.8s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1800.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1801.8s)]
*  No, I think this is perfect. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1802.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1803.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1804.8s)]
*  And time. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1805.8s)]
*  What was that? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1806.8s)]
*  You were like, oh, we got to come in early. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1807.8s)]
*  We could have gone to the arcade. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1808.8s)]
*  We could have gone to the arcade. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1811.8s)]
*  Yeah, we really could have. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1812.8s)]
*  Marsh cooked it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1813.8s)]
*  Okay, then I'll make him up when he gets here. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1814.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1819.8s)]
*  Five minutes. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1820.8s)]
*  Camera in the reflection, huh-huh. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1821.8s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1822.8s)]
*  Yeah, there's a mirror behind us. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1823.8s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1824.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1825.8s)]
*  That's why I was wondering. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1826.8s)]
*  It's kind of like- [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1827.8s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1828.8s)]
*  Oh, it looks good. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1829.8s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1830.8s)]
*  I'll get a tweet about it tomorrow. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1831.8s)]
*  Can I pass you one of our mics as well? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1832.8s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1833.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1834.8s)]
*  What do you smell like a little BTS fix from last school? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1835.8s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1836.8s)]
*  The little dot sign on the outside. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1837.8s)]
*  This guy. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1838.8s)]
*  Oh, is it on? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1839.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's on. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1840.8s)]
*  We're not recording, but it's on. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1841.8s)]
*  Okay, I pressed it once, though. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1842.8s)]
*  Oh, let me see. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1843.8s)]
*  It might be off now. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1844.8s)]
*  No, it's still good. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1845.8s)]
*  That was just the noise-canceling button. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1846.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1847.8s)]
*  That's good. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1848.8s)]
*  Then when he gets here, I'll throw the one that I have on. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1849.8s)]
*  This is the part, this is the microphone, right? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1867.8s)]
*  The small one is. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1868.94s)]
*  Yeah, the small one is. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1869.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1870.94s)]
*  It's like the cousin of that mic, actually. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1871.94s)]
*  Is it better? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1874.44s)]
*  It's like just different. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1875.44s)]
*  But is it better? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1877.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1878.48s)]
*  I'm still comparing them. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=1880.16s)]

*  This is my first time in... [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2402.92s)]
*  First time in Queens? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2404.92s)]
*  Yeah, I've never been to Queens before. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2405.92s)]
*  No way. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2407.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2408.92s)]
*  Dude. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2409.92s)]
*  It's very nice. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2410.92s)]
*  It's the best place. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2411.92s)]
*  It's actually super chill. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2412.92s)]
*  It's very chill. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2414.92s)]
*  I get why the other boroughs constantly have to defend themselves tooth and nail, have [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2417.92s)]
*  to fight for it. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2423.92s)]
*  They don't get a lot of play due to Manhattan being right there but this is... [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2425.92s)]
*  This is awesome. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2430.92s)]
*  I'm going to put the doughnuts in here. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2431.92s)]
*  Hassan, you've been here for five minutes. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2433.92s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2435.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to move to Queens. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2439.92s)]
*  You should. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2442.92s)]
*  Okay, now let me see the mic. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2443.92s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2444.92s)]
*  Grab it. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2445.92s)]
*  Of course, give it over here. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2446.92s)]
*  Yes, we're going to share the name of the coffee shop afterwards. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2453.92s)]
*  Of course. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2456.92s)]
*  Bro, we're going to go. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2460.92s)]
*  We're going to go to... [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2463.92s)]
*  We're going to go... [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2464.92s)]
*  I'm not going to go to Cake and Falafel this time but... [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2465.92s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2468.92s)]
*  Hello, man. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2469.92s)]
*  How's it going? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2470.92s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2471.92s)]
*  Nice to meet you too. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2472.92s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2473.92s)]
*  No, thank you for doing this. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2474.92s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2475.92s)]
*  You mind wearing this for me? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2476.92s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2477.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2478.92s)]
*  Just a little magnet. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2479.92s)]
*  You can throw it on. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2480.92s)]
*  Yeah, sounds good. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2481.92s)]
*  Is this good for you? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2482.92s)]
*  Maybe a little higher. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2483.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2484.92s)]
*  How's that? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2485.92s)]
*  Throw it on? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2486.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2487.92s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2488.92s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2489.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2490.92s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2491.92s)]
*  Even more. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2492.92s)]
*  Even more. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2493.92s)]
*  Thanks so much for this, man. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2494.92s)]
*  This is just awesome. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2495.92s)]
*  And then you can sit here. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2496.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2497.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2498.92s)]
*  Zoran. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2499.92s)]
*  How's it going, sir? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2500.92s)]
*  It's going pretty good. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2503.92s)]
*  This is my first time in Queens. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2505.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2507.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm excited to be out here for the occasion. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2508.92s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani, everybody. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2511.92s)]
*  Running for New York mayor. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2513.92s)]
*  Going to win the New York mayoral race. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2514.92s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2516.92s)]
*  Hopefully, inshallah. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2517.92s)]
*  Zoran, you're a busy guy. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2518.92s)]
*  You're all over the place. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2521.92s)]
*  You had a rally earlier today. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2523.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2524.92s)]
*  How did that go? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2525.92s)]
*  It went well. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2526.92s)]
*  It was a rally for a rent freeze with tenants in Sunset Park with incredible city councilman, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2527.92s)]
*  Alex DeViles, Assemblymember Marcelo Matanis, and a bunch of tenants who are tired of seeing [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2531.92s)]
*  their landlords profit while their rents keep going up. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2536.92s)]
*  What made you want to run for mayor? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2539.92s)]
*  I think ultimately it was that there's a cost of living crisis in our city. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2542.92s)]
*  And Eric Adams has used almost every opportunity to exacerbate that crisis. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2547.92s)]
*  He has put his thumb on the scale of corporations, of landlords, and New Yorkers have been paying [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2550.92s)]
*  for it, and they've been priced out of the city that they built. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2556.92s)]
*  We can actually change that. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2559.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2561.92s)]
*  Also, I do have to mention, you know how when PBS does the, when they do a story on Facebook, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2562.92s)]
*  they'll be like, we're funded by Facebook? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2568.92s)]
*  As a Turkish person? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2570.92s)]
*  Yeah, just this is... [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2572.92s)]
*  I have to say... [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2573.92s)]
*  We're actually really worried about this interview. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2574.92s)]
*  As a Turkish person, I have to say, Eric Adams is our guy, okay? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2575.92s)]
*  And he represents my interests, and I'm actually here to extract concessions from you, similar [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2580.92s)]
*  to what Eric Adams gave to the Turkish government. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2586.92s)]
*  Look, I'm making a pledge now that when I get a hair transplant, there's only one place [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2588.92s)]
*  I'm going. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2593.92s)]
*  Okay, perfect. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2594.92s)]
*  But I'm paying for it. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2595.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2596.92s)]
*  I'm paying for it. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2597.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2598.92s)]
*  But I'm getting it. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2599.92s)]
*  Depending on what we can do with the fire code, we can make that an option. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2600.92s)]
*  Where we are right now is totally up to code. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2604.92s)]
*  I'm joking. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2606.92s)]
*  This is a joke. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2607.92s)]
*  Okay, so you're 33 years old. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2609.92s)]
*  I'm 33 years old. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2612.92s)]
*  Yeah, we're the same age, which is crazy because I'm a loser, and you're running for mayor [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2613.92s)]
*  of New York. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2617.92s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2618.92s)]
*  That like 33 year olds are running for mayor of New York. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2619.92s)]
*  Here we are. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2622.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2623.92s)]
*  And you're, according to the latest polls, you're in the second place. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2624.92s)]
*  It's ranked choice, so it's a little bit different. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2628.92s)]
*  Do you mind explaining that process to our viewers? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2630.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2632.92s)]
*  This is the second election for New York City mayor that has ranked choice voting. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2633.92s)]
*  What that means is that New Yorkers get five options, and they put in their options, their [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2638.92s)]
*  first place choice up to their fifth place choice. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2642.92s)]
*  And if your first place choice is eliminated, then your vote goes to your second place and [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2645.92s)]
*  so on and so forth until there's someone who has received more than 50% of New Yorkers' [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2648.92s)]
*  votes. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2653.92s)]
*  And last time around, Eric Adams won the race with about 7,000 votes in a city of 8.5 million [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2654.92s)]
*  people. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2660.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2661.92s)]
*  And now around, only 40% of New Yorkers' votes were counted because people hadn't filled [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2662.92s)]
*  out their whole ballot. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2666.92s)]
*  They just kind of gave up. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2667.92s)]
*  They're just like, you know, I'm voting for one, I'm voting for two, that's enough. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2668.92s)]
*  I mean, I've had uncles come up to me in the mosque and be like, I'm voting for you and [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2670.92s)]
*  nobody else. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2673.92s)]
*  And I'm like, no, you're not. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2674.92s)]
*  You're voting for me, you're voting for the rest of your ballot, and you're not ranking [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2675.92s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2678.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2679.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2680.92s)]
*  That's good for people to know. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2681.92s)]
*  So for that reason, it's a unique predicament because it's a ranked choice situation. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2683.92s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo entertained running for a little bit, for quite a while, as a matter of fact. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2689.92s)]
*  And I think the media, given his institutional backing, was teasing that alongside him. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2695.92s)]
*  And he has a lot of name recognition. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2702.92s)]
*  Do you feel like name recognition is one of the major hurdles you have to clear in this [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2704.92s)]
*  race? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2708.92s)]
*  Yeah, I also think it's a major opportunity because right now the polls are just a reflection [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2709.92s)]
*  of that recognition. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2712.92s)]
*  Love him or hate him, you know who Andrew Cuomo is. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2713.92s)]
*  And we're in second place. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2716.92s)]
*  Still, more than 50% of New Yorkers do not know who I am. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2718.92s)]
*  And that means we can just keep doing the hard work of introducing ourselves. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2721.92s)]
*  And actually, it's easier to introduce yourself to someone than convince them to feel differently [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2725.92s)]
*  about you. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2729.92s)]
*  And that's where Andrew Cuomo has an obstacle that everyone knows who he is, but still, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2730.92s)]
*  with 100% name recognition, he has not surpassed 50% in support. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2734.92s)]
*  There's more than 50% of New Yorkers who want someone else. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2738.92s)]
*  And now it's our job to introduce ourselves. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2740.92s)]
*  Twitch stream, one Twitch stream at a time. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2743.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, this is probably the least important part of that process because I feel like you're [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2745.92s)]
*  doing a lot in terms of door knocking. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2751.92s)]
*  You have a lot of people who are very excited for you. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2753.92s)]
*  And that's a really good thing. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2756.92s)]
*  And also, it does seem like the establishment picks in the race are kind of experiencing [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2758.92s)]
*  a bunch of fissures amongst themselves. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2765.92s)]
*  Now, Eric Adams is choosing to run as an independent from what I understand. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2767.92s)]
*  My man's out. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2772.92s)]
*  Yeah, so do you feel like that's a good move or do you feel like that's better for your chances [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2773.92s)]
*  overall or worse overall? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2779.92s)]
*  I don't think it affects our chances much. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2781.92s)]
*  We've always said we were running against Eric Adams the second term, and Andrew Cuomo [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2783.92s)]
*  is running for that. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2786.92s)]
*  He's running for the same vision, same donor, same corruption. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2787.92s)]
*  Now it's just clear that he is the one messenger of that vision of a New York City where people [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2790.92s)]
*  are profiting off of others' misery. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2795.92s)]
*  And what we are fighting for is just as clear as it was day one, that New York City people can afford. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2797.92s)]
*  What are some of the top line agenda items that you have first day in? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2802.92s)]
*  All right, here we go. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2807.92s)]
*  First of all, no more Turkish Airlines corruption. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2808.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2810.92s)]
*  No disrespect to your people. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2811.92s)]
*  That's a bit of a bummer because I was a single issue voter. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2812.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2815.92s)]
*  I was going to illegally vote in the race for you. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2816.92s)]
*  Making it very clear. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2817.92s)]
*  One, two, three, four, five, and now. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2819.92s)]
*  Do not do that. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2821.92s)]
*  The number one thing is cost of living. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2824.92s)]
*  The number one thing is to make the city affordable. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2826.92s)]
*  And the number one cost in New Yorker's life when they're thinking about that is housing. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2828.92s)]
*  About two and a half million New Yorkers live in rent stabilized housing across New York City. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2832.92s)]
*  Their rent increases are set by the mayor. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2836.92s)]
*  This mayor has jacked their rent up 9%. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2838.92s)]
*  I would freeze their rent for close to two and a half million people. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2840.92s)]
*  I would make the slowest buses in the country fast and free in our city. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2844.92s)]
*  Make them a model for this nation. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2848.92s)]
*  And I would deliver universal child care to New Yorkers, whether they're six weeks or five years of age. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2850.92s)]
*  And ultimately it's using every tool the public sector has to make the city people can afford. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2854.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2860.92s)]
*  There's also, from what I understand, there's a lot of opinions on the issue of housing. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2862.92s)]
*  You got yinbies on the one side. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2866.92s)]
*  Yes, in my backyarders who consistently advocate for deregulation and de-zoning. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2868.92s)]
*  And there's some truth to that for sure in terms of how much of a hurdle that is for developing new housing projects. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2873.92s)]
*  And then you have the nimbies on the other side who also have some opinions on this matter. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2880.92s)]
*  But I feel like there's one issue that I don't hear a lot of coverage on. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2886.92s)]
*  You're like a hindi. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2892.92s)]
*  I don't know what I would be. I just want public housing. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2893.92s)]
*  I want Austrian style, you know, red Vienna. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2896.92s)]
*  65% of the entire city is just peppered with government housing. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2900.92s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2906.92s)]
*  I don't know if we're going to get that. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2907.92s)]
*  I feel like if I even say that, a real estate developer is going to drone strike me as I walk out of this. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2909.92s)]
*  We got five minutes. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2914.92s)]
*  Of this institution. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2915.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2916.92s)]
*  But I do think that any move in that direction is great. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2917.92s)]
*  But the reason why I'm bringing this up is because there's also, from what I understand, a warehousing problem here where approximately 75,000 units that are rent controlled units in the city are purposely being kept away from the housing market. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2922.92s)]
*  There's a bunch of different hurdles in front of the lottery system and how inaccessible even rent control units are overall. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2937.92s)]
*  Is that a real issue? Am I making this up? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2949.92s)]
*  No, I think, look, is there anywhere to tackle that? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2953.92s)]
*  Right now, the way that it works is that landlords self-report the units that they're warehousing. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2955.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2961.92s)]
*  And obviously there are limitations to the efficacy of self-reporting something that you are doing, especially when you're a landlord taking a unit off the market. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2962.92s)]
*  I've seen estimates that start in the mid-20,000 range with units. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2971.92s)]
*  And I think what we have to do is the city has to take a much more muscular role in gathering that information and in finding out what is the reason why units are offline and what's the actual cost of bringing them back online. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2975.92s)]
*  Because without that data, it just becomes the discourse where a landlord will say, it's too expensive to do so. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2986.92s)]
*  Trust me. And we actually need to be able to see the stats. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2992.92s)]
*  And to your point, we need a ton more housing in New York City. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2995.92s)]
*  I do believe we have to build more density around transit hubs. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=2999.92s)]
*  We have to end requirements to build parking when we build housing, up zone wealthier neighborhoods. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3003.92s)]
*  And I also think the public sector has a role to build immediately affordable housing. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3008.92s)]
*  Last year, we opened up a wait list in New York City for people to get assistance paying their rent. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3012.92s)]
*  In seven days, 600,000 New Yorkers applied. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3017.92s)]
*  And at the end of that period, 200,000. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3021.92s)]
*  A lot of broke boys. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3023.92s)]
*  A lot of broke boys and broke girls and broke uncles and aunties. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3024.92s)]
*  And at the end of that period, 200,000 won, which basically meant they got on a wait list for a program that admits 250 people a month. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3027.92s)]
*  It's a totally broken system. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3035.92s)]
*  And so what we're saying is alongside those zoning reforms, we're going to build 200,000 truly affordable union built rent stabilized homes that will cater to a median household income of that of New Yorkers. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3037.92s)]
*  Seventy two thousand dollars for a family of four. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3048.92s)]
*  There's obviously the issue of public private partnership when we have this conversation to begin with. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3051.92s)]
*  I don't know what the limitations are as far as the New York mayor, the mayoral position in terms of maybe not eminent domain, but there's a lot of power, but pushing and pulling. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3058.92s)]
*  Yeah. What are the what are the levers of power that you have? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3070.92s)]
*  You know, even even now under Eric Adams, the city has the authority to take over a building that is owned by a landlord who's been operating in violation to city code. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3072.92s)]
*  He doesn't use that power. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3082.92s)]
*  They don't use those tools. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3084.92s)]
*  But that is absolutely an existing program that's existed even for prior administrations. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3085.92s)]
*  And that is something we would use. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3089.92s)]
*  We would increase fines for dangerous conditions. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3091.92s)]
*  We would increase them for immediately hazardous ones. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3094.92s)]
*  And if you're a landlord who isn't abiding by that, we would take that building and give it back to the tenants who are currently living through those conditions. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3096.92s)]
*  OK, walk me through this. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3102.92s)]
*  I call my landlord. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3105.92s)]
*  I'm like, the microwave is not working. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3106.92s)]
*  Landlord says, I'll fix it. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3109.92s)]
*  Doesn't fix it for a month. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3111.92s)]
*  Eminent domain. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3113.92s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3114.92s)]
*  Because first of all, most New Yorkers don't even have their landlords sell. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3116.92s)]
*  OK, a lot of New Yorkers live in buildings that are owned by LLCs. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3119.92s)]
*  They have no idea who owns the building. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3123.92s)]
*  Even even better. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3124.92s)]
*  I call up the apartment property manager and they don't fix it. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3125.92s)]
*  OK, I come in, I say, hey, this this electric circuit is broken. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3129.92s)]
*  They come in and they paint white over it. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3135.92s)]
*  They say it's not a circuit anymore. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3137.92s)]
*  That's just the wall. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3139.92s)]
*  Eminent domain. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3140.92s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3141.92s)]
*  No. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3142.92s)]
*  OK, but here's how it works. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3143.92s)]
*  I'm going to keep testing the water. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3144.92s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3145.92s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3146.92s)]
*  You have a system right now where you call 311, right, in New York City. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3147.92s)]
*  Most New Yorkers who ever call 311 have had a pretty frustrating experience with it. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3151.92s)]
*  We are proposing a world class brand new innovation where you can make appointments with investigators so that you know when they're actually coming home. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3155.92s)]
*  Seems radical. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3164.92s)]
*  Seems pretty radical. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3165.92s)]
*  Seems pretty crazy, but you heard it here first. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3166.92s)]
*  You're actually going to know when an investigator comes by. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3167.92s)]
*  And what we will track is if a landlord is found in violation to the code and they are not following up on those violations, they are not rectifying it, then there will be a time at which the city will take over that building. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3169.92s)]
*  OK, I like that. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3183.92s)]
*  So there is a takeover happening eventually if they are serial violators. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3184.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3188.92s)]
*  OK, I'm a fan of that. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3189.92s)]
*  It's not going to be for the microwave. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3190.92s)]
*  But yeah, no, it's fine. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3191.92s)]
*  It's just a random experience. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3193.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3195.92s)]
*  I'm just bringing that up. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3196.92s)]
*  OK, so housing is obviously a major issue. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3197.92s)]
*  Let's talk about public transit. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3200.92s)]
*  I'm a little bit autistic. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3202.92s)]
*  I'm an enjoyer of public transit. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3204.92s)]
*  I haven't been able to enjoy it here because I'm streaming. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3206.92s)]
*  So, you know, there's no Wi-Fi down there. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3209.92s)]
*  What about the bus? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3212.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3213.92s)]
*  Well, like I said, I just I've been here for a limited time. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3214.92s)]
*  So what are your what are your suggestions for improvement? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3217.92s)]
*  Where are the areas of need for public transit in New York? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3222.92s)]
*  I would say the areas are around affordability, reliability, accessibility. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3225.92s)]
*  Those are some of the major areas and generally the sense that how many more cops are we getting in the MTF? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3230.92s)]
*  We are not. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3234.92s)]
*  We are not getting more cops. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3235.92s)]
*  I lied. I said I was a single issue voter. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3236.92s)]
*  I'm a double issue voter. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3238.92s)]
*  Look, I think I think what New Yorkers deserve is to be safe. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3239.92s)]
*  And for too long, we've had so-called leaders who've told them the same proposals they've been given year after year only to end up with the same results. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3242.92s)]
*  And for safety, we are actually putting together we've put together a proposal to create a Department of Community Safety, the DCS, which would protect New Yorkers like never before. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3251.92s)]
*  And it would do it in ways that we've already seen be proven successful. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3260.92s)]
*  Things like dedicated outreach teams placed on 100 different subway stations, the ones that have the highest levels of mental health crises, homelessness. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3265.92s)]
*  Are they going to play Candy Crush? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3273.92s)]
*  They're not going to play Candy Crush. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3274.92s)]
*  I feel like that's been working so far. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3277.92s)]
*  Very effective. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3280.92s)]
*  They're not going to be playing Candy Crush. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3281.92s)]
*  OK. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3282.92s)]
*  And this is going to be paired with, you know, if you grew up in New York City, there are a lot of commercial units that you remember in subway stations. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3283.92s)]
*  Like I grew up in New York City. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3291.92s)]
*  I moved here when I was seven years old. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3293.92s)]
*  I first lived in Morningside Heights. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3294.92s)]
*  I would take the one train down to 96, then take the two train down to Times Square and walk up the stairs down the stairs. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3296.92s)]
*  There would always be a record store that was selling CDs, headphones. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3301.92s)]
*  That's a Times Square. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3306.92s)]
*  That's gone now. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3307.92s)]
*  It's just a vacant commercial unit. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3308.92s)]
*  So as part of this proposal, we're going to transform that unit, make it a place where you can receive medical care, connections to long term care and in tandem with all those things, invest in transit ambassadors. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3309.92s)]
*  Because a lot of people, the help that they want in the moment is just somebody who can answer a question that they have. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3319.92s)]
*  What's the delay that they're facing on the subway line that they're trying to take? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3324.92s)]
*  How can they actually get out? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3327.92s)]
*  What escalator is working? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3329.92s)]
*  What elevator is working? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3330.92s)]
*  This is something that they deserve someone to actually answer those questions who's trained and tasked with those exact responsibilities. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3331.92s)]
*  No, no, they will not. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3336.92s)]
*  No candy crush. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3338.92s)]
*  I'm confused because I feel like that's what the government, like that's what public service is supposed to do at the subway stations with guns. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3339.92s)]
*  But I guess, are they going to have guns? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3347.92s)]
*  These are not going to have guns. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3349.92s)]
*  Damn it. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3351.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3352.92s)]
*  But just to your question about public transit, right? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3353.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3355.92s)]
*  One of the things I love most about being a New Yorker is public transit. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3356.92s)]
*  That we can get around this city on a bus. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3359.92s)]
*  One of the only things, one of the only cities that has like, oh, there's some, but this is the one that has like the most. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3361.92s)]
*  I mean, 40% of public transit trips in America are from the MTA. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3367.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3371.92s)]
*  40%. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3372.92s)]
*  It's all right here across these five boroughs and surrounding counties. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3373.92s)]
*  And yet we see a lot of New Yorkers being priced out of that. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3376.92s)]
*  One in five can't afford a MetroCard today. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3379.92s)]
*  And they're also, if they can't afford it, they're sitting on that platform waiting for 10 minutes, 15 minutes. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3382.92s)]
*  And if they're waiting for a bus, I mean, you look at a bus time app on your phone, it says the bus is going to be there in 20 minutes. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3387.92s)]
*  Sometimes it just never even appears. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3393.92s)]
*  So these are things that don't actually have to be this way. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3395.92s)]
*  That's what we're going to do when we make buses fast and free. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3397.92s)]
*  How do you reinstill confidence in even local government like that? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3399.92s)]
*  Because I feel like this is a major hurdle to clear for anyone that is even remotely to the left of, I guess, Donald Trump. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3404.92s)]
*  When you talk about the government doing something, the government doing right by you, I feel like especially accelerated since the Reagan era, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3413.92s)]
*  there's this attitude from the average American that like, there's not really anything that these guys are doing for us. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3420.92s)]
*  Do you have an attitude? Is it just, you know, show your work and hopefully people eventually believe that the subway stations are going to be clean and the buses are going to run on time? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3426.92s)]
*  I think you have to show your work. You have to actually deliver it. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3440.92s)]
*  Because the reason people don't believe in government is that they haven't seen it actually impact their lives in a positive way in a long time. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3443.92s)]
*  And there's one recent example we have in congestion pricing, which was a program that was said to once implemented would decrease congestion, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3450.92s)]
*  would increase bus speeds, reduce emissions, would raise money for the MTA. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3460.92s)]
*  And just at the point at which it was about to be implemented, it was at a very low level of popularity, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3464.92s)]
*  which is the same thing that happened with similar schemes in Stockholm and London. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3470.92s)]
*  But once it came into effect, you had people who were previously in opposition starting to support it because they could actually experience those tangible benefits. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3474.92s)]
*  Now, I think that kind of program still needs to be paired with more immediate investments in public transit service. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3482.92s)]
*  And that's what I've been fighting for in Albany as a state legislator. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3488.92s)]
*  So you don't want the Bridgertonnel crowd around these parks. That's what I'm getting. I'm kidding. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3491.92s)]
*  Room for everybody. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3496.92s)]
*  Yeah. OK. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3499.92s)]
*  One thing that I feel like you do differently than a lot of other politicians is you talk about the underlying reasons to why crime persists. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3501.92s)]
*  When you talk about homelessness, you understand that a big part of that is housing. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3512.92s)]
*  As a matter of fact, the major role that it plays in accelerating homelessness. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3516.92s)]
*  When talking about crime, your initiatives focus on also solving the underlying material inequalities where crime manifests. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3521.92s)]
*  What are some of the initiatives that you want to take in that regard in terms of like you've suggested cooperative grocery stores, for example? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3530.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we are living in a city where so many New Yorkers are being priced out of produce. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3539.92s)]
*  And it doesn't matter how much they earn. They feel the sticker shock when they go to the grocery store. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3545.92s)]
*  And we have that in tandem with food deserts, which are something that disproportionately impacts black and Latino New Yorkers. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3550.92s)]
*  I represent Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing development in North America. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3558.92s)]
*  And when I speak to my constituents at Queensbridge, I'm asked this question. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3562.92s)]
*  Why is it that there are six fast food restaurants in a five block radius, but the only place I can buy produce is clearly old and outdated and not the kind of food that is fit for my family to eat? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3566.92s)]
*  And I don't have an answer to that. And this is now starting to answer that question, which is that if it can work in Kansas, if a feasibility study in Chicago found this to be doable, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3576.92s)]
*  why in New York City are we allowing people to be priced out of bread and milk and eggs when we can actually guarantee cheaper prices, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3586.92s)]
*  especially at a time when we're seeing these prices skyrocket even more thanks to Donald Trump's economic policies? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3592.92s)]
*  Yeah. What about Twinkies? Are they going to still have Twinkies at the cooperative grocery stores? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3598.92s)]
*  Thanks to you now, we can say there are going to be some Twinkies. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3602.92s)]
*  I lied. I'm a triple issue voter. Not even a single issue. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3604.92s)]
*  By the end of today, we've got 10. 10 issues coming out. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3608.92s)]
*  All right. So Twinkies in the cooperative grocery stores. How does that structure work? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3610.92s)]
*  The Twinkies in the cooperative? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3614.92s)]
*  No, no. Sometimes I'm joking. Sometimes I'm being serious. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3616.92s)]
*  How does the cooperative grocery structure work? Those of you at home that might not be familiar. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3620.92s)]
*  So the idea of a municipal owned grocery store, our proposal is a pilot of one in each borough that would be city run, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3627.92s)]
*  that would guarantee cheaper groceries in a few ways. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3636.92s)]
*  The first is that it would not have to pay rent or property taxes to the city or institution, pass those savings directly on to the customer. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3639.92s)]
*  The second is that it would not be mandated to have to make a profit in these moments. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3647.92s)]
*  We've seen that in Kansas it is profitable, but also there are times where you will see the avian flu is jacking up the cost of eggs to a level that New Yorkers can't even afford. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3652.92s)]
*  It is possible for us to absorb some of those costs to ensure that people can actually buy the eggs that they need. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3661.92s)]
*  And additionally, we would purchase at wholesale prices and then pass that on to New Yorkers. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3666.92s)]
*  Now, this is a pilot program that would cost $60 million, which sounds like a substantial amount of money. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3671.92s)]
*  Not for New York. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3678.92s)]
*  Not for New York City. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3679.92s)]
*  I would compare it to the more than 100- [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3680.92s)]
*  It's like one New York police department submarine. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3682.92s)]
*  It's the submarine upkeep. For one year, you're not using the sub. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3684.92s)]
*  Allegedly. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3689.92s)]
*  Wait, is that alleged? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3690.92s)]
*  I thought they had one. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3692.92s)]
*  I'm leaving that to you. That's your number four policy. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3695.92s)]
*  I want to see the submarine. That's my fourth policy. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3700.92s)]
*  But right now we're already set to spend $140 million subsidizing corporate grocery stores. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3704.92s)]
*  It's a program in the city called CityFresh. They don't guarantee cheaper prices. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3709.92s)]
*  They don't guarantee a unionized workforce. They are not required to accept SNAP or WIC. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3713.92s)]
*  And they've been shown no impact on actual prices. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3718.92s)]
*  They don't even have SNAP? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3720.92s)]
*  They don't have to accept it. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3721.92s)]
*  They don't have to accept it? That's crazy. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3722.92s)]
*  And so we would spend less than half of that money on guaranteeing the whole kinds of needs that New Yorkers have that are currently not being met by this program. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3724.92s)]
*  And there would be workers at these locations as well? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3732.92s)]
*  Yes, a unionized workforce. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3736.92s)]
*  And this would be a pilot program to start with one in each borough. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3738.92s)]
*  And what we're already hearing from New Yorkers is that they can't wait for this because as we've seen in a poll, it is a majority of New Yorkers who want this. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3741.92s)]
*  And I think even a majority of Republicans. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3749.92s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the Data for Progress poll that you recently posted. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3751.92s)]
*  It said, what is it, 60% of Republicans, I think, even, or a majority of Republicans were on board with it. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3754.92s)]
*  Seems like a good idea. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3759.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3762.92s)]
*  What are some of the other problems in terms of, because New Yorkers, from what I understand, and I was talking to Chi earlier about this, they are, I guess, more moderate in some senses than what the rest of the country would perceive them as. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3764.92s)]
*  And there are concerns about safety in general in New York. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3782.92s)]
*  Now, some of that is because of the hyper focus of the media places on crime, and it makes people think like apps like Nextdoor and the constant crime is happening all around us does have a tendency to cause people to hyper fixate on it. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3786.92s)]
*  But beyond that, there are issues of crime in the city as well. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3803.92s)]
*  And obviously outside of safety and public transit or outside of offering food at a subsidized or cheaper cost, more affordable food and housing issues, what are some of the other areas where you can tackle crime and explain to New Yorkers that you have their back in terms of safety? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3807.92s)]
*  This is absolutely a major priority for New Yorkers. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3829.92s)]
*  And what our Department of Community Safety would do is not only tackle the mental health crisis, but also hate violence, gun violence epidemic, victim services, and ensure that we are also taking on homelessness. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3832.92s)]
*  And the thing that's so exciting about this is some of this is built off of programs that have been successful elsewhere in the country, places like Denver, Eugene, Olympia. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3845.92s)]
*  Some of it's also based on what's been successful in New York City. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3854.92s)]
*  I mean, gun violence when you treat it as a public health epidemic. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3857.92s)]
*  Stop and frisk. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3860.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3861.92s)]
*  We're bringing it back. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3862.92s)]
*  No, we're not bringing it back. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3863.92s)]
*  Eric has a lot of that. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3864.92s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3865.92s)]
*  I misunderstood. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3866.92s)]
*  We are not bringing back stop and frisk to be very clear. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3867.92s)]
*  What we are going to scale up are programs that have been shown to be effective at reducing gun violence. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3869.92s)]
*  These are programs that exist in a number of precincts across New York City, but for some reason they've not been expanded to all of them. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3874.92s)]
*  Another example I would give you. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3880.92s)]
*  What are the programs? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3881.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3882.92s)]
*  It's a cure violence approach. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3883.92s)]
*  This is an approach that invests in gun violence interrupters, people who are actually located within the communities that have been racked with gun violence and who understand that it's not as simple as just putting another police officer on the corner to deal with this kind of an issue. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3884.92s)]
*  When in fact, it's more effectively responded to through these kinds of means. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3898.92s)]
*  But we have more than 70 police precincts in New York City. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3901.92s)]
*  These programs are only instituted at less than 30 of them. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3905.92s)]
*  This is something that every New Yorker should benefit from. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3907.92s)]
*  And it's good for the cops. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3910.92s)]
*  They can just sit around and play Candy Crush in their cop cars as opposed to stopping and frisking random people. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3911.92s)]
*  The police's responsibility will be major categories of crime. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3920.92s)]
*  And that is a place where I've also heard from New Yorkers who are saying they're not feeling safe, that they're also troubled by the fact that there are very low clearance rates in a lot of these major categories. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3924.92s)]
*  And that's where the focus should be while investing in proven strategies that can actually take on these new causes. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3933.92s)]
*  Under the Zoran leadership, hit it. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3939.92s)]
*  The New York City, New York City police departments, when there's a crime happening, they have to respond and they actually have to improve their clearance rates. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3942.92s)]
*  What are you saying? So let's say, I don't know, my car got stolen. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3954.92s)]
*  I call the cops. They don't pick up the phone. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3959.92s)]
*  I call again. They pick up the phone and I tell them my car is stolen. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3962.92s)]
*  They're like, all right, file some paperwork. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3966.92s)]
*  The fuck do you want me to do about it? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3968.92s)]
*  Then they don't actually even seek it out. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3970.92s)]
*  I find the car myself personally and then I retrieve it under your leadership. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3973.92s)]
*  That's not happening. They're actually going to, you know, solve crimes. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3978.92s)]
*  Yeah, under under my leadership, whatever they do, I don't know what they do. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3981.92s)]
*  Like right now, I'll give you an example. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3985.92s)]
*  I'll give you an example right now. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3987.92s)]
*  You have you have the NYPD receiving more than 200 mental health calls in a day. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3988.92s)]
*  We know that the NYPD are not the best responders to these crises, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=3994.92s)]
*  whether in the fact that not in the way that they've been trained. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4000.92s)]
*  And also when you hear from NYPD officers, this is not an interest that they have as to fulfilling. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4002.92s)]
*  I sat down with a family of a New Yorker named Wyn Rosario, who is a Bangladeshi New Yorker who called 911 because he was experiencing mental health crisis. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4007.92s)]
*  And police officers came to his house who had been trained to deal with mental health crises and killed him within three minutes. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4018.92s)]
*  That's the current system that we have. It is one that is not serving any New Yorker. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4024.92s)]
*  And under my administration, we would have actually proven strategies in dealing with the crises that are affecting so many New Yorkers lives [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4029.92s)]
*  and having the police play a critical role in major categories of crimes, not in the ones that they've been tasked with. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4037.92s)]
*  OK, so fair hoppers were not beating them up? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4044.92s)]
*  No, that seems like an important role. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4048.92s)]
*  And I think, you know, when we when we talk about fair evasion, the MTA did its own blue ribbon panel study that found the greatest correlation between a level of fair evasion in a neighborhood is the level of poverty in that neighborhood. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4051.92s)]
*  That's shocking. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4064.92s)]
*  The poorer you are, the more likely you are to not be able to pay for this critical thing that you need to. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4065.92s)]
*  And so one of the most effective selfishness, one of the most effective ways to deal with this is when we make buses free. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4072.92s)]
*  We actually make it accessible for every New Yorker and more than a million New Yorkers ride buses every day. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4079.92s)]
*  Why don't we actually give them back their right, which is to get around the city and make sure you have a little grind harder if they if the buses are free. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4083.92s)]
*  Have you thought about that? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4091.92s)]
*  This is a question that keeps me up at night. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4092.92s)]
*  Yeah, because it feels like there'd be too much commerce in that case. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4094.92s)]
*  And the poor business owners would have to work way harder if there's more people, more foot traffic coming in through their businesses. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4097.92s)]
*  It seems very careless. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4104.92s)]
*  It seems very thoughtless. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4106.92s)]
*  I'm moral hazard, if you will. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4107.92s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. I see you. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4109.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4110.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4111.92s)]
*  What about the real estate developers? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4112.92s)]
*  Let's talk about the the unheard minority, the marginalized people of wealth, POW. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4113.92s)]
*  I feel like they're they're getting a hard bargain here with you. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4121.92s)]
*  Do you have anything to say to them? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4125.92s)]
*  You know, to all my landlords on the stream, how many landers do you have? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4127.92s)]
*  All of them. Yeah, they're all watching. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4132.92s)]
*  Shout out to all the boys at home. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4134.92s)]
*  They're hate watching. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4135.92s)]
*  Yeah, shout out to all the boys at home. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4136.92s)]
*  The real workers. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4138.92s)]
*  Yeah, they they don't like me very much. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4139.92s)]
*  Because these are policies that would stop their ability to extract wealth from working class New Yorkers at the levels that they've been enjoying for years. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4143.92s)]
*  And ultimately, we're talking about a rent freeze, right? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4151.92s)]
*  They are still collecting rent from New Yorkers. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4155.92s)]
*  They are still. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4158.92s)]
*  I think Matt Iglesias had a stroke somewhere. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4159.92s)]
*  He's not even watching. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4160.92s)]
*  He just heard that concept be addressed on a live stream and just he had a little baby stroke. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4161.92s)]
*  But I think I think there are a lot of people who've made a lot of money in the last few years. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4167.92s)]
*  And those are people who went all in on Eric Adams. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4172.92s)]
*  And now they're going all in on Andrew Cuomo because they know that if they if they go for the most corrupt possible leadership, they protect their bottom lines in a way that they have never seen before. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4175.92s)]
*  And they know that if they actually opt for honest leadership, then it's going to be having to factor in, you know, basic things like dignity for working class New Yorkers when they're figuring out their policies. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4184.92s)]
*  How much of the counterterrorism unit would you use on college students that annoy me? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4194.92s)]
*  Personally, I would not be. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4199.92s)]
*  And I was proud to be the first mayoral candidate. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4201.92s)]
*  I think the only one, not even a little bit. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4203.92s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4205.92s)]
*  What if they hurt my feelings? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4206.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4207.92s)]
*  What if they hurt an apartheid state's feelings like a hypothetical one? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4208.92s)]
*  Look, this is the job of a New York City mayor is to keep the use counterterrorism against Colombian students. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4211.92s)]
*  No, no, no, it's to keep New Yorkers safe. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4218.92s)]
*  And that's why I said I would not have sent the NYPD onto Columbia's campus or CUNY's campus, because so much of the justification for it was around safety. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4220.92s)]
*  And that decision made students the least safe they had been in one police officer discharging their weapon in the court. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4228.92s)]
*  Cops do that when they're under stress. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4235.92s)]
*  It's a natural reaction. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4238.92s)]
*  Look, I think I think then you make a decision when you send a militarized police force onto a campus, you open yourself up to all these possibilities. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4240.92s)]
*  And that's not any single one that New Yorkers should have to experience. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4247.92s)]
*  And multiple kids were hospitalized because of this. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4250.92s)]
*  Yeah, because they used flashbang and I believe tear gas as well for crowd dispersal, which is incendiary and can kill you. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4253.92s)]
*  And it has. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4263.92s)]
*  Cops have killed babies in cribs in the past when they've used flashbang grenades like that. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4264.92s)]
*  Yeah, probably not the best idea. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4271.92s)]
*  OK, you would have you be in command of one of the largest standing militaries on the planet. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4273.92s)]
*  What kind of parades would they do on the streets of New York? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4279.92s)]
*  That is the that is the lowest priority is figuring out the parade schedule. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4283.92s)]
*  You're not giving me anything. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4287.92s)]
*  I know. I know. I'm just sorry. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4288.92s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4290.92s)]
*  I can't know. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4291.92s)]
*  What parades do you want? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4292.92s)]
*  Put the submarine on a truck and then parade it along. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4293.92s)]
*  If that were to happen, would you take the bus with me? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4297.92s)]
*  Yes, 100 percent. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4299.92s)]
*  And this way cops would get to walk a little bit. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4301.92s)]
*  And that's probably the first time they will ever do any physical activity. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4304.92s)]
*  And therefore they could be more in shape. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4309.92s)]
*  I think the focus will be on keeping New Yorkers safe. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4311.92s)]
*  And I don't think parades parades really have to be out there with that. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4314.92s)]
*  So you don't like parades. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4317.92s)]
*  Gay Pride Parade. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4318.92s)]
*  Support. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4320.92s)]
*  That's almost. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4321.92s)]
*  I almost got you. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4323.92s)]
*  Support. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4324.92s)]
*  I'm trying to get a gotcha out of you. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4325.92s)]
*  Not going to work on me. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4327.92s)]
*  Okay, so the Gay Pride Parade you're on board with, but no cop parade. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4328.92s)]
*  They're pretty gay. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4332.92s)]
*  What about gay cops? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4334.92s)]
*  They can do a parade? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4336.92s)]
*  There are going to be a lot of parades, but it's going to be after we keep New Yorkers safe. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4337.92s)]
*  Okay, they're going to do a parade, but no submarines. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4341.92s)]
*  All right. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4344.92s)]
*  Do you want to bring out the donuts by the way? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4349.92s)]
*  I'm just staring at my attack ads in the face. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4351.92s)]
*  Oh, you got the donuts right there? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4355.92s)]
*  Take a look at the guys that are going to be spent multi-million dollar opposition pieces. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4356.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4363.92s)]
*  What do we got here, Ali? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4364.92s)]
*  These are our fairy donuts. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4365.92s)]
*  Caramel custard, rose water glaze, pistachios on top. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4366.92s)]
*  Three? You brought three for each. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4371.92s)]
*  So what are we doing? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4373.92s)]
*  This is abundance. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4374.92s)]
*  All for you. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4376.92s)]
*  Are we going to try to see who can eat it faster? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4377.92s)]
*  No. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4380.92s)]
*  No, please. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4381.92s)]
*  All three. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4382.92s)]
*  Do you work out? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4383.92s)]
*  Not for everybody. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4384.92s)]
*  Do you work out? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4385.92s)]
*  Not really. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4386.92s)]
*  No? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4387.92s)]
*  No. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4388.92s)]
*  How do you stay in shape then? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4389.92s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4390.92s)]
*  Can you say that to the camera? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4391.92s)]
*  No, you're in great shape. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4392.92s)]
*  I'm not glazing. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4393.92s)]
*  I'm serious. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4394.92s)]
*  But if we were glazing, we'd be making these fairy donuts. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4395.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4396.92s)]
*  Because they're glazed. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4397.92s)]
*  They're glazed. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4398.92s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4399.92s)]
*  All right, I'm going to try one. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4400.92s)]
*  Oh my God, this looks great. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4401.92s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4402.92s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4403.92s)]
*  To two guys who work out allegedly. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4404.92s)]
*  Oh, that was bomb. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4405.92s)]
*  It's fire. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4408.92s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4409.92s)]
*  Is there rose water in it too? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4411.92s)]
*  There's rose water, yeah. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4412.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4413.92s)]
*  That's great. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4414.92s)]
*  This is stupid. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4415.92s)]
*  Can I bother you for some water? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4416.92s)]
*  Here, do you want this? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4417.92s)]
*  I haven't used it. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4418.92s)]
*  Come on. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4419.92s)]
*  Socialism. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4420.92s)]
*  That's a scary word. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4421.92s)]
*  Socialism? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4422.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4423.92s)]
*  So you're a socialist? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4424.92s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4425.92s)]
*  Democratic socialist, baby. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4426.92s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4427.92s)]
*  Socialism. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4428.92s)]
*  Socialism. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4429.92s)]
*  Socialism. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4430.92s)]
*  Socialism. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4431.92s)]

*  Socialism. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4436.92s)]
*  Socialism. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4437.92s)]
*  Socialism. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4438.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4439.92s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4440.92s)]
*  First of all, I'm a member of New York City DSA. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4441.92s)]
*  That interests you. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4446.0s)]
*  Socialist.nyc. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4447.56s)]
*  Forward slash join. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4448.56s)]
*  Second of all, I define it using the words of others of extending democracy from the [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4449.56s)]
*  ballot box to people's lives, of making sure that everybody has what they need to live [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4455.52s)]
*  a dignified life. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4459.6s)]
*  And that may also now include Feudy Donuts. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4461.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4463.76s)]
*  So we're putting Ali to work. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4464.76s)]
*  He is making these for every New Yorker. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4466.84s)]
*  That's it. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4469.0s)]
*  Are you committed? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4470.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4471.0s)]
*  I see. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4472.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4473.0s)]
*  Why do you think it's such a scary word? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4476.0s)]
*  Is it a scary word in New York? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4479.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4481.4s)]
*  Look, I mean, I'm a Muslim democratic socialist. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4482.4s)]
*  I'm used to really bad PR and people being very scary. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4485.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4488.96s)]
*  I know about that a little bit. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4491.96s)]
*  I think it's scary because people have been taught to fear the word, the idea, and also [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4496.36s)]
*  generally the notion that people deserve dignity, that they don't have to earn it every single [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4504.24s)]
*  day. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4510.12s)]
*  Because to believe that would call into question how we're forced to spend much of our lives, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4511.48s)]
*  which is on a hamster wheel fighting for the most basic necessities. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4517.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4520.92s)]
*  Meritocracy. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4521.92s)]
*  Obviously real. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4522.92s)]
*  Elon Musk worked the hardest and the smartest. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4524.8s)]
*  Why do you hate the successful wealthy people like Elon Musk, who clearly have worked very [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4528.88s)]
*  hard to earn $300 billion? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4533.76s)]
*  If we want to credit Elon Musk, we've got to also credit some of his greatest assistants [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4537.08s)]
*  in the game, Andrew Cuomo being one of them, who gave Elon Musk about a billion dollars [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4542.0s)]
*  in a public subsidy for Tesla many years ago before Donald Trump even got on the Elon Musk [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4546.56s)]
*  crane. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4553.0s)]
*  I think that's what's so frustrating about so many of these figures is they masquerade [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4554.0s)]
*  as being... [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4557.64s)]
*  What did he do with a billion dollars of subsidy? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4558.64s)]
*  We're still trying to figure it out. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4560.04s)]
*  Wait, so what is... [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4561.68s)]

*  Not at the level that was promised. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4574.64s)]

*  So you keep bringing up abundance mindset. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4706.04s)]
*  What do you think about the abundance mindset? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4707.04s)]
*  I mean, you keep bringing it up. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4708.04s)]
*  I did this to myself. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4710.24s)]

*  Say something nice about Ezra Klein and then something mean about him. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4717.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4720.24s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4721.24s)]
*  The thing that I would say is nice about Ezra Klein is I very much appreciated him being [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4722.28s)]
*  willing to bring up what a lot of Americans saw with regards to Joe Biden and the campaign's [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4727.04s)]
*  ability to actually win that race. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4732.16s)]

*  It wasn't popular. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4735.24s)]
*  And... [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4736.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4737.24s)]
*  Nobody canceled him for that. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4738.24s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4739.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4740.24s)]

*  He's brilliant. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4743.24s)]
*  He has really good policies and his brain is fine. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4744.24s)]
*  That's what they kept saying. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4749.5199999999995s)]
*  About Ezra Klein? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4750.76s)]
*  Oh, about Joe Biden. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4752.280000000001s)]
*  About Joe Biden. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4753.280000000001s)]
*  When I said it, but then when Ezra Klein says it, everyone's like, oh, you're brilliant. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4754.280000000001s)]
*  I love abundance. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4757.04s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4758.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4759.04s)]
*  So that's it. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4760.04s)]
*  But when he first said it, you got a lot of heat because he was breaking from the stated [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4761.04s)]
*  answer. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4765.0s)]
*  Mainstream position. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4766.0s)]
*  I actually think that there's room for kind of a through line between the abundance mindset [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4767.0s)]
*  and what it means to be a democratic socialist in that one of the greatest obstacles we face [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4773.84s)]
*  the existing inefficiencies, inadequacies of the public sector. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4779.92s)]
*  And if we want to get people to trust in the public sector, we have to deliver outcomes [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4784.12s)]
*  that they haven't seen. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4788.12s)]
*  I mean, if you think about the subway, which we love, Andrew Cuomo built the most expensive [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4789.12s)]
*  subway mile in the world. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4793.92s)]
*  And he did it by spending more money on consultants than construction. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4796.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4800.0s)]
*  Swag is how he's going to find it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4801.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4803.04s)]
*  But I mean, this is also an issue where we've taken away public sector capacity to the extent [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4804.04s)]
*  where we're unable to build anything and we're relying on McKinsey to tell us how to even [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4808.32s)]
*  build a trash can. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4811.96s)]
*  And what that has left us with is these projects. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4813.5199999999995s)]
*  What will Pete Buttigieg do if you don't rely on McKinsey and consulting firms like that? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4816.12s)]
*  I think Pete Buttigieg is working right now and you're hurting his feelings. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4821.88s)]
*  I think that what we need to do is make sure that capacity is internal. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4825.92s)]
*  And that's the capacity that we have lost, whether it's building bike lanes or bus lanes, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4829.48s)]
*  whether it's building the subways. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4834.92s)]
*  And that's something we need to bring back. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4836.76s)]
*  And that's something that really is a choice between Andrew Cuomo taking us back to those [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4837.76s)]
*  days of consulting or building a future we can build it ourselves. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4841.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, suggestion. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4844.52s)]
*  Hit it. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4845.76s)]
*  No more buses. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4847.280000000001s)]
*  We only have those horse carts because they're very cool. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4848.52s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of poop, unfortunately. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4853.12s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4855.68s)]
*  Horse carts, no more cars at all. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4857.280000000001s)]
*  Just horse carts. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4859.76s)]
*  I'm going to go on a strong no. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4860.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4862.04s)]
*  On this one, we're going to diverge. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4863.04s)]
*  But horses are very cool. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4864.04s)]
*  They're like big dogs. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4865.04s)]
*  Shout out to my big dogs. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4866.12s)]
*  Inside every one of you is a big dog and maybe a horse. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4868.24s)]
*  And two wolves. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4873.12s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4874.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4875.12s)]
*  Which one? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4876.12s)]
*  A horse. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4877.12s)]
*  Big horse. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4878.12s)]
*  And a wolf. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4879.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4880.12s)]
*  Okay, so. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4881.12s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have sound effects. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4882.12s)]
*  None of the... [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4887.12s)]
*  No horses, no horse race. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4888.12s)]
*  All right. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4890.12s)]
*  What about the bike guys? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4891.12s)]
*  A lot of them are Turkish. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4892.96s)]
*  This would be huge for the Turkish economy in New York. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4894.8s)]
*  It seems like it's just three professions if you're Turkish in New York or just universally [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4899.04s)]
*  is barbershop, kebab, guys who do the bikes who charge you a lot of money. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4903.400000000001s)]
*  But if you speak Turkish to them, they will charge you less money. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4911.96s)]
*  When you say do the bikes, do you mean get on the bikes in the back in sightseeing or [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4913.96s)]
*  you mean deliver food? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4917.4800000000005s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4918.4800000000005s)]
*  They get on a bike and then you can sit in the back of the bike. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4920.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4922.4800000000005s)]
*  Like Central Park. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4924.16s)]
*  Central Park. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4925.16s)]
*  Yeah, they got lights in the back. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4926.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4927.16s)]
*  Doesn't seem like a very efficient mode of transportation, but carbon emissions, pretty [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4928.16s)]
*  good. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4931.16s)]
*  Sometimes, you know, the journey is the trip. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4932.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4933.719999999999s)]
*  Is that the phrase? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4934.719999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's the phrase. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4935.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4936.719999999999s)]
*  It's not the journey, it's the destination. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4937.719999999999s)]
*  No, I'm saying it's the other way. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4938.719999999999s)]
*  Or it's not the destination, it's the journey. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4939.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's how you're supposed to say it. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4942.32s)]
*  Okay, ask him to rank his favorite sex in the city characters. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4944.919999999999s)]
*  Miranda, Miranda, Miranda, Miranda. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4947.919999999999s)]
*  All-time Miranda. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4949.919999999999s)]
*  Okay, that seems a little bit... [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4950.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4953.36s)]
*  Cynthia Nixon. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4954.36s)]
*  She endorsed you, I believe, right? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4955.36s)]
*  She supported me. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4957.36s)]
*  But I think even more than that is she had the courage to take on Andrew Cuomo when a [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4958.36s)]
*  lot of people didn't. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4961.96s)]
*  This is back in 2018. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4963.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4964.4s)]
*  And he was running our subways into the ground. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4965.4s)]
*  And she stood up and she said, we're going to tax the rich to fix the subways. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4968.8s)]
*  And that there could actually be a different style of politics, to the extent that Andrew [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4972.28s)]
*  Cuomo had to adopt a lot of her own policies to get re-elected. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4975.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4978.92s)]
*  So what other Sex in the City character has done that? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4979.92s)]
*  I don't really remember any of the characters. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4982.92s)]
*  I'm just reading questions. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4984.92s)]
*  Politicians, look at you copping out. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4985.92s)]
*  He's lying. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4987.92s)]
*  I'm just reading from the chat. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4988.92s)]
*  No, no, I have watched it. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4989.92s)]
*  I just don't remember any of the characters. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4990.92s)]
*  I'm just reading chat right now to see what they want to ask. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4993.92s)]
*  Chat, if you have any questions, put it in the chat. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=4996.92s)]
*  I have a question. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5000.92s)]
*  Hit it. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5001.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5002.92s)]
*  Shout out to my fellow Casio brother. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5003.92s)]
*  And then CA. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5004.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5005.92s)]
*  So, well, it's famously, I feel like New York City mayor is maybe the worst job in American politics. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5007.92s)]
*  I'm sure you notice. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5016.92s)]
*  I've heard it described that way. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5017.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5019.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5020.92s)]
*  So part of the reason for that, as you know, is because it's incredibly, I mean, the mayor [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5021.92s)]
*  is often kneecapped, right? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5024.92s)]
*  So if you're walking into this office, right, how do you build coalitions when you're coming [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5026.92s)]
*  in and you have strong opposition in terms of one of the most powerful forces in the [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5033.92s)]
*  city is the NYPD. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5037.92s)]
*  We kind of saw what happened during de Blasio's time in office. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5039.92s)]
*  He had a very tense relationship with them. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5043.92s)]
*  I think it made promises that he would initially sort of disappear, right? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5046.92s)]
*  So what kind of coalition are you trying to build and how do you grow that coalition? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5051.92s)]
*  No, it's a great question. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5057.92s)]
*  It's a great question and it speaks to our commitment to not just win the race, but to [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5059.92s)]
*  build a coalition that can govern. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5064.92s)]
*  And it's easy to look at Eric Adams now and see him as a caricature of a Republican cop [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5067.92s)]
*  and forget how he ran in 2021. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5072.92s)]
*  He ran in 2021 telling New Yorkers that they didn't have to choose between safety or justice. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5074.92s)]
*  And there was a large constituency that voted for him that was interested in those questions [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5079.92s)]
*  of not having to choose those two things. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5083.92s)]
*  And that means there's a constituency beyond just progressives who want to see a different [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5086.92s)]
*  approach to public safety in our city, one that foregrounds evidence proven strategies [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5090.92s)]
*  that we've seen be successful elsewhere in the country. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5095.92s)]
*  So I think there is that clear-eyed nature of it. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5098.92s)]
*  The other thing I would say is being very direct with New Yorkers as to the message and [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5101.92s)]
*  the platform of this campaign. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5107.92s)]
*  When I go to events, I typically start it off with asking people to finish the sentence [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5109.92s)]
*  as to what we're fighting for. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5114.92s)]
*  We're running to freeze the rent, to make buses fast and free, to deliver universal [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5115.92s)]
*  child care. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5120.92s)]
*  And the reason I want them to know that is I also want them to hold me accountable to [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5121.92s)]
*  that from the very first day that I'm the mayor. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5125.92s)]
*  Because that accountability, that relationship is one that we have to bring back to get people [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5127.92s)]
*  to actually believe in the possibility of local politics. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5131.92s)]
*  And I think there's also something else which is, it's not quite in your question, but I've [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5135.92s)]
*  also just heard it a bunch in a similar vein, is this notion, especially for us on the left, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5141.92s)]
*  that if we don't run for executive positions, then we're not responsible for what happens, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5147.92s)]
*  that we are not culpable in the immense contradictions that come with this kind of role. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5154.92s)]
*  And I fully believe that we're responsible whether or not we're in power. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5159.92s)]
*  We are still New Yorkers. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5163.92s)]
*  We are still allowing this to take place. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5164.92s)]
*  And we are best served by actually grappling with these contradictions directly and doing [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5166.92s)]
*  everything in our power to deliver that which we've seen so many of our neighbors be denied. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5171.92s)]
*  You like that? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5176.92s)]
*  He's a bit of an anarchist. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5179.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5180.92s)]
*  No, no, please. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5181.92s)]
*  There's room for everybody's questions. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5182.92s)]
*  Immediately. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5184.92s)]
*  This isn't Andrew Cuomo. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5185.92s)]
*  I'll take all the questions. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5186.92s)]
*  It's a give and take. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5187.92s)]
*  Like, I want cops to have more money and more guns, and he wants less. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5188.92s)]
*  Which is weird because his job requires him to actively fight against cops, or did. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5193.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5201.92s)]
*  Shouts Legal Aid. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5202.92s)]
*  Great work. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5203.92s)]
*  Shout out to Legal Defenders. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5204.92s)]
*  Shout out to a friend of mine, Sam McCann. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5205.92s)]
*  He worked for Legal Defender. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5207.92s)]
*  Was he cool, the Legal Aid guy that he shouted out? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5209.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5212.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5213.92s)]
*  A lot of people are cooler than me. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5214.92s)]
*  It's not saying much. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5216.92s)]
*  I think you're equally cool. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5218.92s)]
*  No, it's fine. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5220.92s)]
*  Ranked choice cool. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5221.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5222.92s)]
*  Like room for more people. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5223.92s)]
*  I'm cooler than Alex. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5224.92s)]
*  That's what matters. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5225.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean anything. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5226.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean anything. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5227.92s)]
*  What about, I mean, there's a couple tougher issues, I think, to broach here. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5228.92s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5233.92s)]
*  Where are we going? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5234.92s)]
*  No, I'm not drunk anymore. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5235.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5237.92s)]
*  So it's, I would say three things that I want to talk to you about before we let you go, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5238.92s)]
*  or rather, I think we're going to like walk around a little bit too, right, if you want [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5246.92s)]
*  to do that. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5249.92s)]
*  I'm down. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5250.92s)]
*  One, immigration. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5251.92s)]
*  Governor of the state of Texas, Greg Abbott, and even Ron DeSantis, shipped in what I think [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5255.92s)]
*  would be considered a human trafficking scheme, a bunch of undocumented migrants into the [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5265.92s)]
*  state of New York, specifically to New York City, and Chicago as well, in an effort to [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5271.92s)]
*  deliberately disrupt the processing of undocumented migrants that had legal asylum claims, and [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5278.92s)]
*  in an effort to basically undermine the federal structure that already existed in this country. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5285.92s)]
*  And unfortunately, they did find much success. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5293.92s)]
*  But I think, especially in a place like New York, the reason why they were able to find [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5297.92s)]
*  the problem, and I think that's a good point, is because of the mis-handling of this administration, [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5302.92s)]
*  or the Biden administration, but specifically with Eric Adams. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5305.92s)]
*  Instead of tackling the problem head on, saying that New York is comprised almost entirely [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5309.92s)]
*  of migrants, that America is a nation of immigrants, and that New York specifically is one of the [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5317.92s)]
*  most diverse places on the planet, and then showing through his work of welcoming the [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5321.92s)]
*  undocumented migrants and working with the government to process them expeditiously, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5329.92s)]
*  I feel like Eric Adams slapped on a Band-Aid solution, and then basically conceded on the [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5334.92s)]
*  front, conceded on the messaging front, that migrants were responsible for a lot of the [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5343.92s)]
*  visible poverty that people see, and also even the crime that people are experiencing. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5348.92s)]
*  There's no evidence to suggest that, as far as I know. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5354.92s)]
*  Maybe in New York it's different, but overall, undocumented migrants are not responsible [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5357.92s)]
*  for a large share of the crimes. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5362.92s)]
*  As a matter of fact, they're responsible for less crime per capita than natural-born US [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5364.92s)]
*  citizens are, and yet this message has persisted. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5368.92s)]
*  And I think it's one that became, it's one that even New Yorkers themselves adopted from what I saw. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5372.92s)]
*  How do you, how would you deal with this issue? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5378.92s)]
*  Like, let's say you were the mayor of New York at that time. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5383.92s)]
*  What would you have done? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5386.92s)]
*  I think the first thing is I wouldn't demonize people that are coming to New York City to call [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5388.92s)]
*  this city their home. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5392.92s)]
*  And we saw this mayor say that migrants were destroying our city. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5394.92s)]
*  And you have what's been described as the second largest bully pulpit in America as the mayor of [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5398.92s)]
*  this city, and you're using it to turn the target onto a set of individuals that are in the most [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5403.92s)]
*  need of this city's assistance. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5409.92s)]
*  And it is something that has led to not only an anti-immigrant sentiment across the city, but even [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5412.92s)]
*  violence against a number of New Yorkers, our newest neighbors. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5419.92s)]
*  And this isn't just a story of cruelty or a story of demonization and demagoguery. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5423.92s)]
*  It's also one of patronage politics. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5430.92s)]
*  You had one of Eric Adams' closest advisors on record saying, where are my crumbs when it came to the [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5433.92s)]
*  contracts that were being handed out from migrant shelters. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5439.92s)]
*  You have a city run by Eric Adams that issued a more than $400 million contract, no bid contract, to a [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5442.92s)]
*  company called DocGo. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5450.92s)]
*  So it's not just a question of cruelty. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5452.92s)]
*  It's not just a question of bigotry. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5454.92s)]
*  It's also a question of an immense amount of money being made with few services to name actually being [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5455.92s)]
*  delivered. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5460.92s)]
*  And in the critiques that had to be made of how the Biden administration was responding to New York [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5461.92s)]
*  City's needs, Eric Adams was on his way to D.C. to make the case and then turned back because his [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5467.92s)]
*  major fundraiser of his campaign was having her house raided by the feds. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5473.92s)]
*  So you cannot have an effective leader who is not actually focused on delivering on these kinds of [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5477.92s)]
*  issues when their number one priority is keeping themselves and their close associates out of jail. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5482.92s)]
*  In terms of hardline policies, though, what are some of the things that you saw that Eric Adams did [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5487.92s)]
*  that you thought were bad? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5497.92s)]
*  And what would you have done differently? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5500.92s)]
*  All right. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5503.92s)]
*  So let me rattle off a few. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5504.92s)]
*  The first is the 30 and 60 day shelter limits that he put in place, forcing migrants to be, forcing them [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5506.92s)]
*  to be evicted out of shelters that were providing them with that. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5512.92s)]
*  And my office actually worked with more than a thousand asylum seekers over the last year partnering with [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5515.92s)]
*  a local organization called Melika where we would assist asylum seekers with applying for city services [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5521.92s)]
*  like a reduced fare metro card or a New York City ID. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5526.92s)]
*  And what we found is that we would see our own clients sleeping on subway platforms who had previously [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5530.92s)]
*  been sleeping in shelters. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5536.92s)]
*  It did nothing for addressing any of the stated reasons. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5538.92s)]
*  But what it was is just cruel. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5541.92s)]
*  The second thing is we have a sanctuary city policy in New York City when it comes to immigration. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5543.92s)]
*  We have a policy that we should be proud of, one that has survived under decades of bipartisan [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5549.92s)]
*  leadership of the city that Eric Adams has now chosen to demonize. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5554.92s)]
*  And the city's policy is that it will not allow ICE agents into city schools, hospitals, properties, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5558.92s)]
*  even properties of city contractors unless they provide a judicial warrant signed by a judge. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5564.92s)]
*  Now, I serve on the city's committee in the assembly in Albany and I get three minutes every year to question the mayor. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5570.92s)]
*  I asked him, would you follow this policy? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5575.92s)]
*  Will you clarify for New Yorkers that this is the law? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5577.92s)]
*  He refused to answer it. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5579.92s)]
*  So what I would also do is establish 100% compliance with that law and establish an oversight commission to ensure [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5581.92s)]
*  that that compliance is being followed even by city contractors because the absence of it. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5587.92s)]
*  What if you were being blackmailed by the administration because you did a pay for play scheme with a foreign [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5591.92s)]
*  government where in order for cheap travel or greatly discounted travel to Turkey, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5597.92s)]
*  you ended up offering a bunch of amenities and then you got investigated by the federal government, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5604.92s)]
*  but then the federal government exchanged hands and the new government decided we are going to bring ICE [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5609.92s)]
*  into all of these facilities, into your schools, into Rikers. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5614.92s)]
*  And you said, oh, great, if you drop my case, I will play ball with you. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5619.92s)]
*  What about in a situation like that? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5625.92s)]
*  Totally hypothetical. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5627.92s)]
*  Totally hypothetical. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5629.92s)]
*  Not sure who you're speaking about, but that would never actually happen to me. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5630.92s)]
*  And I think that's another concern that we also have with Andrew Cuomo is, you know, [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5632.92s)]
*  there are issues hanging over his head that New Yorkers have a right to be concerned about as to whether [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5637.92s)]
*  it will impact the way in which he governs this city and what's so... [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5642.92s)]
*  No female security detail. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5646.92s)]
*  I mean, it's honestly, it's also just so infuriating to be in the Democratic Party [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5648.92s)]
*  and position ourselves as being in stark contrast to the sexual harassment and assault that we have seen [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5656.92s)]
*  endemic in so many Republican leaders and then offer a contrast in Andrew Cuomo, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5666.92s)]
*  someone who's been credibly accused by more than 10 women of sexual harassment, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5673.92s)]
*  and to say that this is just the way politics is going to be, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5677.92s)]
*  then you obviously end up with the way that people feel a sense of despair. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5681.92s)]
*  Yeah, Democrats do definitely have a hypocrisy problem. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5684.92s)]
*  Well, for two reasons. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5687.92s)]
*  One, because they do sometimes care about at least being called a hypocrite, [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5689.92s)]
*  whereas Republicans do not. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5693.92s)]
*  They are un-blackmailable in that regard. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5695.92s)]
*  But also, on top of that, they do sometimes follow through on addressing some of these issues, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5699.92s)]
*  but then whenever push comes to shove and they feel like there's a powerful person that's about to get into a role, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5708.92s)]
*  they quickly forget about their past sexual misconduct allegations. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5713.92s)]
*  But there's more to it, since you're no longer just running against Eric Adams, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5721.92s)]
*  but also now running against Andrew Cuomo as well. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5727.92s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5729.92s)]
*  If given the opportunity, how much Medicaid would you cut from underserved and impoverished state hospital programs [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5731.92s)]
*  specifically to kill the working poor? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5743.92s)]
*  Because that's what Andrew Cuomo did, so I'm just trying to figure out. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5745.92s)]
*  I feel like that's a qualification to run from. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5748.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, seemingly the qualification is a complete disregard for working people. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5751.92s)]
*  What if COVID struck and then in that process you already underfunded the medical system of New York [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5756.92s)]
*  and then a lot of old people die in the process? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5762.92s)]
*  In this scenario, is this person also getting a $5 million book deal to write about leadership in that crisis [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5765.92s)]
*  while sending 15,000 people to their death in nursing homes? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5770.92s)]
*  You got it. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5773.92s)]
*  I feel like I know this guy. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5775.92s)]
*  No, I'm saying you understand the role. You understand the role that you need to take. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5777.92s)]
*  This is what's passed for leadership in our state, in our city. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5781.92s)]
*  Okay, here's a campaign ad. Andrew Cuomo killed your grandparents. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5784.92s)]
*  I think for a lot of New Yorkers it's true. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5790.92s)]
*  I mean, but maybe, okay, we can workshop that one. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5792.92s)]
*  All right. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5795.92s)]
*  Boomer side, Andrew Cuomo. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5797.92s)]
*  He did that. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5799.92s)]
*  Okay, never mind. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5801.92s)]
*  He did do that though. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5804.92s)]
*  I'm saying that. He's not saying that. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5806.92s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5808.92s)]
*  That's a sneeze to make sure that it was his remarks. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5810.92s)]
*  Yeah, that was just my remarks. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5813.92s)]
*  Criminal justice reform. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5815.92s)]
*  Rikers is exploding in capacity. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5818.92s)]
*  Horrifying situation. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5824.92s)]
*  There's a lot that could be done there. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5826.92s)]
*  What would you do? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5829.92s)]
*  I would actually try and follow the law, which is a stark contrast from Eric Adams. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5832.92s)]
*  We have a law to close Rikers Island by 2027. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5837.92s)]
*  And Eric Adams has made it functionally impossible to follow that because of how little he has done over the last few years, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5841.92s)]
*  except for actually increasing the population of incarcerated New Yorkers. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5847.92s)]
*  We've had a number of New Yorkers lose their life on Rikers just in these past few weeks. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5851.92s)]
*  And the last time I visited Rikers, a colleague of mine had an incarcerated New Yorker try to take their own life in front of them. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5857.92s)]
*  That's the level of despair that we're talking about. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5864.92s)]
*  And what we would do from the very first day is pursue every single alternative that we have to incarceration to ensure that we're actually keeping New Yorkers safe. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5867.92s)]
*  Because this is sustained on our city. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5876.92s)]
*  It's sustained on our country. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5880.92s)]
*  And it's something that we have been all too willing to allow to continue when we know that it's not just the law. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5881.92s)]
*  It's also a moral imperative. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5887.92s)]
*  And, you know, fiscally, if we're talking about the fiscal cost, it costs New York City more than $500,000 a year to incarcerate someone on Rikers. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5888.92s)]
*  And to put someone in a year of supportive housing, it's about $50,000 a year. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5898.92s)]
*  Right. There is there is no point for that kind of price. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5903.92s)]
*  That's an incredible amount of money. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5906.92s)]
*  I feel like I wouldn't do any crimes if I was in a penthouse. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5908.92s)]
*  If you had $500,000, that's a lot of money. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5911.92s)]
*  Give me the $500,000. I'm not I'm not doing crimes. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5913.92s)]
*  What how about we do that? Give criminals $500,000. Is that a good policy? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5917.92s)]
*  I'm going to wait for you to run for mayor to address that. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5922.92s)]
*  Yeah. You do a crime, you're getting $500,000 from me directly. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5924.92s)]
*  I'm giving it to you. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5929.92s)]
*  Not from me. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5930.92s)]
*  I feel like that might incentivize people to do crime. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5931.92s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5933.92s)]
*  I think that might be an issue. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5935.92s)]
*  Yeah. OK, so we won't do that. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5936.92s)]
*  All right. Never mind. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5938.92s)]
*  That's why you're running for mayor and I'm a stupid Twitch streamer. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5939.92s)]
*  OK, I have another question. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5944.92s)]
*  Israel. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5948.92s)]
*  What are we feeling? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5950.92s)]
*  Good, bad? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5952.92s)]
*  How are they? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5953.92s)]
*  How are they doing? [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5955.92s)]
*  Not well. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5956.92s)]
*  No, not well at all. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5957.92s)]
*  Look, I think many New Yorkers far more than than the political class would have. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5959.92s)]
*  The political class would have you imagine have been rightfully horrified by a genocide that they've seen over more than 15 months of. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5965.92s)]
*  And I've long stood up for universal human rights and extending them to Palestinians because I think that any politics worth its salt has to be one that is universal, that doesn't draw an exception. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5974.92s)]
*  And in this country, we've drawn exceptions for far too long, especially when it comes to the application of it to Palestinians. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5987.92s)]
*  You're getting dangerously in anti-Semitism territory talking about human rights. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5994.92s)]
*  I think according to Andrew Cuomo, because for him, when you stand up for human rights, you are labeled as an anti-Semite. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=5998.92s)]
*  And what it does. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6005.92s)]
*  Well, he he did, from what I understand, try to be the legal counsel for Benjamin Netanyahu. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6006.92s)]
*  So he's he's really busy. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6012.92s)]
*  I don't know why he's running for mayor. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6014.92s)]
*  He should just do that instead. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6016.92s)]
*  He should just defend war criminals. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6017.92s)]
*  That's what he should do. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6019.92s)]
*  And I think that what's so frustrating about this is he's taking a real crisis of anti-Semitism in our city and he's weaponizing it purely for personal gain. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6020.92s)]
*  And that's what he's done time and time again. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6031.92s)]
*  He puts himself before anything and in the process tries to mischaracterize any New Yorker standing up to say that every single person deserves freedom and justice and safety. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6033.92s)]
*  I feel like maybe I'm wrong on this, but New Yorkers, as well as every American, values free speech and due process a lot more than the feelings of people that are falsely conflating an entire religion with an apartheid ethnostate that is doing a genocide. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6044.92s)]
*  That's just me. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6064.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6065.92s)]
*  I feel like maybe I'm off base with this, but it does feel like that to me. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6066.92s)]
*  I mean, I think. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6070.92s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6071.92s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6072.92s)]
*  The First Amendment is the bedrock of this country. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6073.92s)]
*  And we have New Yorkers who have been dragged from their apartment building lobby from the hands of their eight month pregnant wife and disappeared to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6076.92s)]
*  And his name is Mahmoud Khalil. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6090.92s)]
*  And he has not been charged with a crime. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6092.92s)]
*  And yet it took Andrew Cuomo 72 hours to issue any statement. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6095.92s)]
*  And when he did issue a statement, it was so confusing to know as to whether or not he actually wanted Mahmoud to be released. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6099.92s)]
*  And then 24 hours later, he actually walked that statement back. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6106.92s)]
*  And this shouldn't be difficult for anyone to say, which is that you should not be imprisoned for political speech, no matter what that political speech is. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6109.92s)]
*  And that if you have a government imprisoning people for no apparent crime and that is still beyond your own reproach, then how can you be trusted to stand up for the city against Donald Trump? [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6119.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to I'm trying to find his his statement here. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6130.92s)]
*  One thing I will please read it out. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6134.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6135.92s)]
*  One thing I will say is, well, Trump seems to like Andrew Cuomo a lot and his own words. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6136.92s)]
*  That's what he said. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6143.92s)]
*  So I understand it because he might see a lot of himself in Cuomo's record. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6144.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6148.92s)]
*  It seems like he wants to really play ball with Andrew Cuomo. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6149.92s)]
*  I don't know if New Yorkers would be down with that, but I don't think so. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6152.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6155.92s)]
*  OK, this article is not showing what it is, but. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6156.92s)]
*  OK, never mind. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6161.92s)]
*  I'm going to give up on this. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6162.92s)]
*  Oh, Adams and Cuomo dodge questions. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6164.92s)]
*  Adams, for his part, provided a more muted response. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6167.92s)]
*  If he has a gun, he needs to go. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6169.92s)]
*  The mayor said at a news conference about getting firearms with the street. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6170.92s)]
*  There's been no evidence. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6173.92s)]
*  Wait, he said he's such a fucking cop. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6174.92s)]
*  He's such a fucking cop, dude. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6177.92s)]
*  He he hypothesized he fantasized about Mama having a gun. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6179.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6183.92s)]
*  Have you ever seen Eric Adams's video about how to search your your child's belongings? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6184.92s)]
*  I have seen that video. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6189.92s)]
*  He used to look a lot more Jack back then. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6190.92s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6192.92s)]
*  You don't think he looks Jack now? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6193.92s)]
*  No, I think it's. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6194.92s)]
*  I have many critiques. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6195.92s)]
*  I don't think it's. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6196.92s)]
*  It's the fake vegan lifestyle. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6197.92s)]
*  He's not a real vegan. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6198.92s)]
*  Are you vegan? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6200.92s)]
*  No, no, not at all. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6201.92s)]
*  No, but he says he is. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6203.92s)]
*  And then eats meat. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6206.92s)]
*  Shout out to Jabari Rizvot, a true vegan. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6208.92s)]
*  You know. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6210.92s)]
*  OK, I can't find it. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6214.92s)]
*  Never mind. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6215.92s)]
*  All right. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6216.92s)]
*  That's what Andrew Cuomo wants. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6217.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6218.92s)]
*  But we'll get that. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6220.92s)]
*  And also, you know, he did he did come out with a bang when he when he launched his Meroe campaign. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6221.92s)]
*  Finally, one of the first events that he put together was a women's women for Cuomo campaign. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6228.92s)]
*  That was that was cool. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6235.92s)]
*  And then also duping a bunch of unions or at least union leadership that was sympathetic to him into bringing their rank and file to a union for unions for Cuomo campaign. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6236.92s)]
*  And apparently the rank and file didn't even know that they were going to a Cuomo campaign. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6248.92s)]
*  Yeah, I read some of I read some of those quotes. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6251.92s)]
*  Yeah, I said I just was told to get on the bus. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6253.92s)]
*  I didn't know where I was going. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6255.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6256.92s)]
*  I mean, that's that's what so much of his campaign is. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6257.92s)]
*  It's mythology that when it's actually pressed and questioned, you realize it starts to fall apart. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6260.92s)]
*  I don't even think people really pay attention to that sort of stuff in general. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6265.92s)]
*  I think overall, looking at the environment, looking at the media landscape, it's just name recognition. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6269.92s)]
*  Good or bad, I think name recognition is both harming Andrew Cuomo, but also helping Andrew Cuomo with a lot of people that simply don't know what he's about or how he would be mayor. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6275.92s)]
*  What is how do you how do you foresee yourself penetrating through that to not people like myself because you have a lot of motion online. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6288.92s)]
*  A lot of people like you online. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6297.92s)]
*  A lot of people like you on Twitter, especially younger people. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6299.92s)]
*  But how do you how do you talk to like the average the uncles? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6304.92s)]
*  Yeah, the 55, 65 year olds that are all around New York City that look at that and go, well, I don't know what this person is. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6310.92s)]
*  And his name sounds scary to me. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6317.92s)]
*  I've never heard this name before. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6319.92s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo, I kind of recognize that. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6321.92s)]
*  I mean, people have been voting for Cuomo's for decades. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6323.92s)]
*  Yeah, because before Andrew Cuomo, there was his father, who was the governor of this state and and his handsome brother. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6326.92s)]
*  But they didn't vote for him. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6332.92s)]
*  No, I would vote for not for mayor for one position. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6333.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6337.92s)]
*  OK, he's a himbo. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6338.92s)]
*  I have himbo solidarity. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6339.92s)]
*  That's why I tried to call you a himby in the beginning. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6340.92s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6342.92s)]
*  I got nobody. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6343.92s)]
*  You know, I got it. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6344.92s)]
*  I got it. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6345.92s)]
*  It wasn't a good joke. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6346.92s)]
*  OK, I just got to get over it. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6347.92s)]
*  I thought it was clearly no one understood it. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6348.92s)]
*  But I actually think it's an opportunity because we're in second place in the polls while more than 50 percent of New Yorkers do not know who I am or who this campaign is, which means there's such a high relationship between people who support this campaign once they actually know about this campaign. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6350.92s)]
*  And so what our task is, is to keep introducing it. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6367.92s)]
*  Now, we've raised eight million dollars. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6372.92s)]
*  We've maximized the fundraising cap, which is the fastest any campaign in history has done it. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6373.92s)]
*  We have knocked on more than 40,000 doors in the last six days. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6378.92s)]
*  We're going to knock on a million doors across New York City. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6382.92s)]
*  A lot of that is introducing ourselves to the uncles and aunties that you're talking about. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6384.92s)]
*  And then also, we are going to spend a lot of the money that we've raised on ads on cable and broadcast and radio and mailers in your mailbox, because so many, especially older New Yorkers, that is the way that they're engaging with politics. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6388.92s)]
*  And I have to incorporate that as well as any other place that I could meet New Yorkers for whom Andrew Cuomo is the name of stability to inform them actually that he is the chaos. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6401.92s)]
*  We are the ones that will provide that stability by stabilizing their rent, by ensuring that it's frozen and by making sure they can actually afford the city. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6411.92s)]
*  OK, I like that. Is there anywhere around here that you would want to go to? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6418.92s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6422.92s)]
*  So can we can we bring our bring our man right in? [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6425.92s)]
*  OK, I'll just give you mine. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6428.92s)]
*  I have some history books in here too. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6433.92s)]
*  Oh, you do? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6435.92s)]
*  So I have some little merch. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6436.92s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6437.92s)]
*  I can't take a merch. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6438.92s)]
*  Oh, you can? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6439.92s)]
*  I can't, but he can. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6440.92s)]
*  No, it's OK. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6441.92s)]
*  100% compliant. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6442.92s)]
*  We were talking about, I think kebabs came up. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6446.92s)]
*  I want to also give a shout out to Ali's dad who runs an incredible place called Sammy's Kebab House just down the block. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6451.92s)]
*  Yeah, he was just talking about it before you got here. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6457.92s)]
*  It's fire. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6459.92s)]
*  We love it. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6460.92s)]
*  Yeah, he was actually he was actually testing you to see if you were corruptible with the merch. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6461.92s)]
*  Oh, you just Eric Adams in the mask. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6465.92s)]
*  The Merchant Little Flower is a one way ticket to Istanbul. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6470.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm sorry. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6473.92s)]
*  Yeah, take it. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6475.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's coming soon. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6476.92s)]
*  You know, I have all these trolls will hit me and they'll be like, are you just mad because your male pattern baldness? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6478.92s)]
*  I'm like, damn, what you got? [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6482.92s)]
*  You got issues with that? [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6484.92s)]
*  I don't think it's there yet. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6485.92s)]
*  But definitely like when people say like racist stuff or the baldness stuff, the baldness stuff gets me. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6486.92s)]
*  It's not the racist stuff. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6491.92s)]
*  OK, you know, I feel that. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6492.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I use. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6495.92s)]
*  What is finasteride? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6496.92s)]
*  It's the only FDA. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6497.92s)]
*  It's a finasteride. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6499.92s)]
*  It's for prostate cancer. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6501.92s)]
*  It's for prostate cancer originally. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6503.92s)]
*  But it is the only FDA approved drug as far as I know that you can take that. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6505.92s)]
*  OK, stop. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6510.92s)]
*  I use it. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6511.92s)]
*  I use finasteride and minoxidil. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6512.92s)]
*  Damn, I just worry about this stuff. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6514.92s)]
*  I don't do anything. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6516.92s)]
*  Yeah, the more you worry about it, the worse it'll get. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6517.92s)]
*  You think it's true? [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6520.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6521.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6522.92s)]
*  I have an uncle. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6523.92s)]
*  I have an uncle who swore to me that if you touch a store, you're going to get a [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6524.92s)]
*  I have an uncle who swore to me that if you touch a certain part of your beard, it'll [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6532.44s)]
*  grow more than if you don't touch the other part of your beard. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6537.44s)]
*  Did it work? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6540.44s)]
*  Did you touch your beard? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6541.44s)]
*  Did you use your beard? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6542.44s)]
*  I haven't done it, but he said that he did it and it did work. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6543.44s)]
*  So that's what I'm also hoping. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6544.44s)]
*  I just keep touching like right here, hoping that it'll just stimulate growth. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6545.44s)]

*  Thank you. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6553.44s)]
*  Are you using it? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6554.44s)]
*  I don't want to say. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6555.44s)]
*  Oh, wait, I'm open about it. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6556.44s)]
*  You can be honest. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6557.44s)]
*  But yeah, shout outs to Little Flower. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=6560.44s)]

*  I can take [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8222.7s)]
*  Okay, the story [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8224.7s)]
*  I'm going to pass this over here [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8226.7s)]
*  The story is that my great grandmother [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8228.7s)]
*  had [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8230.7s)]
*  Great great grandmother had about five kids [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8232.7s)]
*  who all died either in childbirth or very young [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8234.7s)]
*  And when she went to the village elder [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8236.7s)]
*  to ask how she could have children [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8238.7s)]
*  that would [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8240.7s)]
*  be healthy [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8242.7s)]
*  that could actually survive [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8244.7s)]
*  What he told her was to [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8246.7s)]
*  cross what was called [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8248.7s)]
*  Kalapani, dark water [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8250.7s)]
*  This was a migration pattern that the British [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8252.7s)]
*  in many ways were responsible for [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8254.7s)]
*  and taking a lot of Indians as indentured servants [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8256.7s)]
*  to build the railways [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8258.7s)]
*  So my family went across the water [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8260.7s)]
*  not as indentured servants but in the hopes [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8262.7s)]
*  of being able to have kids, especially my great great grandmother [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8264.7s)]
*  She ended up having I think about eight kids [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8266.7s)]
*  It worked [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8268.7s)]
*  So they were [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8270.7s)]
*  between Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8272.7s)]
*  Uganda is where my dad grew up [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8274.7s)]
*  and [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8276.7s)]
*  he was in Uganda until [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8278.7s)]
*  Uganda won its independence [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8280.7s)]
*  In 1962 the US government [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8282.7s)]

*  you're from Philadelphia, you lie to people [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8438.7s)]

*  Yeah, I shouldn't be saying that [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8472.7s)]
*  Yeah, I shouldn't be saying that [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8474.7s)]

*  I went to University of Miami first, and then Rutgers [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8484.7s)]
*  Because my parents made me transfer [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8486.7s)]
*  Because I was having a little bit too much fun [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8488.7s)]
*  And [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8490.7s)]

*  And then I was just like [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8538.7s)]
*  Would you feel it? [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8540.7s)]

*  I don't really care, but my family is [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8556.7s)]
*  Fenerbahçe, so I guess I gotta say [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8558.7s)]
*  Fenerbahçe [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8560.7s)]
*  That's what it is [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8562.7s)]
*  But I'm not like [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8564.7s)]
*  I don't really watch soccer like that [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8566.7s)]

*  Not really [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8570.7s)]
*  I don't really watch a lot of sports [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8572.7s)]
*  I only play basketball [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8574.7s)]

*  The Turkish team [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8582.7s)]
*  Because [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8584.7s)]
*  That was a wild time [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8586.7s)]
*  That was a big deal [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8588.7s)]
*  I think the Turkish team was ahead for like [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8590.7s)]
*  A total of 7 minutes over the course [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8592.7s)]
*  Of the whole tournament [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8594.7s)]
*  Just kept having last minute equalizers [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=8596.7s)]

*  Talk to me about your ideological [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9022.7s)]
*  Journey [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9024.7s)]
*  How did you arrive at socialism? [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9026.7s)]
*  You know it was [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9028.7s)]
*  Bernie's 2016 run [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9030.7s)]
*  That gave me the language of democratic [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9032.7s)]
*  Socialism [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9034.7s)]
*  Gave me the sense that these ideas [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9036.7s)]
*  That I thought maybe were disparate, that were unconnected [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9038.7s)]
*  Were in fact rooted in one [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9040.7s)]
*  Similar framework [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9042.7s)]
*  How you see the world, the world you fight for [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9044.7s)]
*  Alright now I'm going to go in with my [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9046.7s)]
*  Hands [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9048.7s)]
*  Why do you have it also with your hands? [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9050.7s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9052.7s)]
*  Let's also, let's all [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9054.7s)]
*  No, no, we're going to eat it with our hands [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9056.7s)]
*  I thought some of the other aunts eating with their hands [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9058.7s)]
*  But I thought it was culturally insensitive [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9060.7s)]
*  To ask, so I didn't want to [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9062.7s)]
*  I didn't want to be like, well I already ate with my hands [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9064.7s)]
*  What am I talking about? [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9066.7s)]
*  It was too hard, it was too hard to [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9068.7s)]
*  To [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9070.7s)]
*  Do without the hands [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9072.7s)]

*  I was one of those guys watching the primary results [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9104.7s)]
*  Even when it was [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9106.7s)]
*  Almost impossible for Bernie to win [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9108.7s)]
*  And be like, I can still pull this off [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9110.7s)]

*  That's true [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9142.7s)]
*  You're gonna need lawyers [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9144.7s)]
*  Maybe [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9146.7s)]
*  I actually have the best lawyer in the business [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9148.7s)]
*  Ali Najmi [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9150.7s)]
*  His hashtag is [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9152.7s)]
*  Not Guilty [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9154.7s)]

*  Incredible, yeah [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9166.7s)]
*  I do not wish [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9168.7s)]
*  To speak with you, answer your questions [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9170.7s)]
*  Or sign or hand you any documents based on my [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9172.7s)]
*  Fifth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9174.7s)]
*  I do not give you permission [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9176.7s)]
*  To enter my home based on the Fourth Amendment rights [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9178.7s)]
*  Under the United States Constitution on this [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9180.7s)]
*  So you just slide this under the door if they come to your door [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9182.7s)]
*  Well no, I like, you know, leaving them in bathrooms [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9184.7s)]
*  No, I'm not [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9188.7s)]
*  I would never mock that [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9190.7s)]
*  I carry them on me, they're important [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9192.7s)]
*  No, it's great [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9194.7s)]
*  This is what Tom Homan talks about [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9196.7s)]
*  He's like complaining [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9198.7s)]
*  These people know their rights [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9200.7s)]
*  It makes it too hard [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9202.7s)]
*  He literally will go on Fox News and be like [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9204.7s)]
*  I hate it, I have to abide by the Constitution [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9206.7s)]
*  Fucking asshole [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9208.7s)]
*  Once upon a time [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9210.7s)]
*  On the Upper West Side [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9212.7s)]
*  At St. Andrew's [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9214.7s)]
*  St. Paul Methodist Church [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9216.7s)]
*  There's like an immigrant outreach thing [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9218.7s)]
*  And there are legal service providers [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9220.7s)]
*  That go there [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9222.7s)]
*  To provide assistance to [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9224.7s)]
*  Undocumented people and [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9226.7s)]
*  Immigrants and other people who are looking for [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9228.7s)]
*  Access to benefits or [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9230.7s)]
*  Concern [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9232.7s)]
*  And something that I've noticed [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9234.7s)]
*  I've been going there [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9236.7s)]
*  Like once a month [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9238.7s)]
*  And what I've noticed is that [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9240.7s)]
*  A lot of places [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9242.7s)]
*  Even people that are [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9244.7s)]
*  Documented are going and seeking out [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9246.7s)]
*  Services [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9248.7s)]
*  Because they're afraid [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9250.7s)]
*  Terrified, people are actually terrified [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9252.7s)]
*  I [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9254.7s)]
*  There are people who are not leaving their homes right now [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9256.7s)]
*  But their entire neighborhoods [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9258.7s)]
*  That are being hollowed out [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9260.7s)]
*  And what is so [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9262.7s)]
*  Frustrating [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9264.7s)]
*  Is there isn't even a recognition of just how [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9266.7s)]
*  Widespread this fear is [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9268.7s)]
*  I know of somebody who took [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9270.7s)]
*  The numbers of all of the [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9272.7s)]
*  Apartment doors off of every single [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9274.7s)]
*  Door in their floor [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9276.7s)]
*  So that I just wouldn't know which door to knock on [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9278.7s)]
*  To find them [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9280.7s)]
*  That's the level of fear [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9282.7s)]
*  And it's [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9284.7s)]
*  To have a leader in this moment [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9286.7s)]
*  Like Adams or one like Cuomo [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9288.7s)]
*  Who refuses to even tell New Yorkers of their rights [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9290.7s)]
*  I mean the reason I asked Adams that question [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9292.7s)]
*  In the hearing was because [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9294.7s)]
*  We've seen a drop in [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9296.7s)]
*  Citywide attendance of about 5% [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9298.7s)]
*  Because kids are not coming to school [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9300.7s)]
*  Because their parents don't know if they're going to come back from school [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9302.7s)]
*  If they can get snatched at school [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9304.7s)]
*  And individual schools have drops of attendance at about [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9306.7s)]
*  20% too [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9308.7s)]
*  It's the complete tearing apart of the fabric of the city [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9310.7s)]
*  And it's not just impacting [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9312.7s)]
*  Undocumented New Yorkers [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9314.7s)]
*  They are New Yorkers [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9316.7s)]
*  They are at the fabric of our city [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9318.7s)]
*  And speaking about New Jersey [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9320.7s)]
*  You know when there was an ice raid in Newark [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9322.7s)]
*  Ras Baraka [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9324.7s)]
*  Correctly called it [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9326.7s)]
*  Unlawfully terrorizing his people [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9328.7s)]
*  He said that this [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9330.7s)]
*  Because they rounded up undocumented residents [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9332.7s)]
*  And citizens alike [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9334.7s)]
*  And he memorably said since [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9336.7s)]
*  You cannot fight extremism with moderation [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9338.7s)]
*  And I really remember that [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9340.7s)]
*  And I hold on to that [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9342.7s)]
*  Because I think it's what's critically important at this moment [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9344.7s)]
*  That's the intemperance behind this [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9346.7s)]
*  Being a sanctuary city to begin with [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9348.7s)]
*  So that these people can take advantage of the services [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9350.7s)]
*  And be functioning [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9352.7s)]
*  Productive members of society [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9354.7s)]
*  Without fear of government overreach [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9356.7s)]
*  And even cooperate with [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9358.7s)]
*  Law enforcement authorities [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9360.7s)]
*  That is the underlying reason for why [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9362.7s)]
*  Sanctuary cities exist to begin with [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9364.7s)]
*  It was safer [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9366.7s)]
*  It was defended by Republican mayors [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9368.7s)]
*  And police [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9370.7s)]
*  Like police departments [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9372.7s)]
*  Because otherwise you're keeping people in the shadows [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9374.7s)]
*  I mean Eric Adams [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9376.7s)]
*  He's willing to throw any New Yorker on the bus [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9380.7s)]
*  And we know that he's not going to be the next mayor of the city [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9382.7s)]
*  We know he's not going to get a second term [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9384.7s)]
*  But what's terrifying is that Andrew Cuomo [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9386.7s)]
*  Is the same kind of politics [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9388.7s)]
*  Just with a little less [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9390.7s)]
*  Brazen corruption [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9392.7s)]
*  And a little more sophisticated about it [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9394.7s)]
*  I think probably higher level of corruption [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9396.7s)]
*  But just not [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9398.7s)]
*  As incompetent [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9400.7s)]
*  And as in your face [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9402.7s)]
*  But who knows [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9404.7s)]
*  I feel like even corruption has gotten [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9406.7s)]
*  It's gotten more brazen across [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9410.7s)]
*  No, I feel like corruption has gotten worse [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9412.7s)]
*  Across the board [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9414.7s)]
*  The people doing it are doing it in more brazen ways [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9416.7s)]
*  On a bastion [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9418.7s)]
*  I mean, you're a state [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9420.7s)]
*  California? [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9422.7s)]
*  No, sorry, I was saying New Jersey [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9424.7s)]
*  I have not lived in New Jersey [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9426.7s)]
*  I was bringing up [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9430.7s)]
*  The senator [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9432.7s)]
*  What's his name? Bob Menendez [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9434.7s)]
*  And the gold bars [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9436.7s)]
*  And the Halal [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9438.7s)]
*  Certification racket [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9440.7s)]
*  No, that's because he [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9442.7s)]
*  He said it's because of his Cuban heritage [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9444.7s)]
*  That he learned to avoid [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9446.7s)]
*  Government overreach and that's why he [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9448.7s)]
*  Did his corruption in gold bars [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9450.7s)]
*  Ironically enough [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9452.7s)]
*  His family did not escape Cuba under the [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9454.7s)]
*  Castro regime [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9456.7s)]
*  They left under Batista [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9458.7s)]
*  Marco Rubio is another Cuban that says that [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9460.7s)]
*  About Castro, even though his [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9462.7s)]
*  Family also fled under Batista [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9464.7s)]
*  It's a very weird [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9466.7s)]
*  Phenomena among Cuban [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9468.7s)]
*  Diaspora people in the United States of America [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9470.7s)]
*  Where they'll just like lie and say they [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9472.7s)]
*  Fled Cuba because of Castro [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9474.7s)]
*  And then you look at their immigration records [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9476.7s)]
*  And they literally fled under Batista [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9478.7s)]
*  All right, who's still fair game for more food? [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9484.7s)]
*  None of you guys? [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9486.7s)]
*  Come on [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9488.7s)]
*  Come on [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9490.7s)]
*  It's so much food [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9492.7s)]
*  It's so much [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9494.7s)]
*  So Bangladesh food, you're supposed to [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9496.7s)]
*  Eat with your hands? [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9498.7s)]
*  I don't think there's a rule [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9500.7s)]
*  But like normally? I think so [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9502.7s)]
*  I mean, I would say generally that's how I [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9504.7s)]
*  Approach South Asian food [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9506.7s)]
*  Listen, there's a lot of white people here [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9508.7s)]
*  You gotta explain some of this stuff [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9510.7s)]
*  Gotcha [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9512.7s)]
*  You will not be [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9514.7s)]
*  Legally required to, but will not be frowned upon [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9516.7s)]
*  And when he's married he's making it [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9518.7s)]
*  Illegal to use utensils [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9520.7s)]
*  Have you gotten [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9522.7s)]
*  Races attacks like that? [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9524.7s)]
*  Like you want to do Sharia law? [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9526.7s)]
*  Every day I get it [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9528.7s)]
*  They keep saying I'm gonna turn New York into New Yorkistan [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9530.7s)]
*  That's so British [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9532.7s)]
*  Every day [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9534.7s)]
*  That's such a British line of attack [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9536.7s)]
*  They did London-stan? I was like did they do London-stan? [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9538.7s)]
*  Yeah, London-istan [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9540.7s)]
*  So that's the one I get [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9542.7s)]
*  I feel like Americans are not [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9544.7s)]
*  Used to that kind of [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9546.7s)]
*  Like Americans are of course very [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9548.7s)]
*  Islamophobic but in a different way [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9550.7s)]
*  That is like a particularly [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9552.7s)]
*  European kind of Islamophobia [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9554.7s)]
*  Like saying a place is gonna turn [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9556.7s)]
*  Into a istan [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9558.7s)]
*  I'm serious [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9560.7s)]
*  That's all I hear from European [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9562.7s)]
*  Neo-Nazis [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9564.7s)]
*  Mmm [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9566.7s)]
*  What's the funniest [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9568.7s)]
*  Attack that you've [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9570.7s)]
*  Received so far? [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9572.7s)]
*  I'll tell you mine [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9574.7s)]
*  I got one [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9576.7s)]
*  There's a guy who's in my tweets [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9578.7s)]
*  Breaking the news that I'm a socialist [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9580.7s)]
*  It's in my bio [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9582.7s)]
*  We do get almost the same [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9584.7s)]
*  Kind of [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9586.7s)]
*  That's a very similar thing [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9588.7s)]
*  That I receive all the time [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9590.7s)]
*  That's very funny [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9592.7s)]
*  I didn't know that by the way about you so now [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9594.7s)]
*  I'm a little frustrated I'm pretty terrified Andrew [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9596.7s)]

*  Why? Big mistake [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9604.7s)]
*  Why would you? Big tent [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9606.7s)]
*  I ratioed Nicki Minaj [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9608.7s)]
*  One time during COVID [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9610.7s)]
*  And then the barbs came after me [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9612.7s)]
*  Big. What did you ratio for her? [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9614.7s)]
*  She was talking about Tucker Carlson or something [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9616.7s)]
*  Or she was talking about how her cousins [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9620.7s)]
*  Balsack grew [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9622.7s)]
*  Because he got the [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9624.7s)]
*  COVID vaccine [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9626.7s)]
*  I'm sorry [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9628.7s)]
*  You asked me what the situation was [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9630.7s)]
*  It could have been like after dinner I'll tell you [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9632.7s)]
*  I didn't even think about that [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9634.7s)]
*  Anyway it was a vaccine thing and I was like the world awaits your [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9636.7s)]
*  Medical contributions like your contribution to medical science [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9638.7s)]
*  And I ratioed her and then the bars got [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9640.7s)]
*  Really mad at me [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9642.7s)]
*  And then [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9644.7s)]
*  I received one of the most hurtful [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9646.7s)]
*  Statements I've ever received in my entire life [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9648.7s)]
*  In my DM someone said [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9650.7s)]
*  You're aging at the speed of white [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9652.7s)]

*  Thinking that I could like understand [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9710.7s)]
*  Where they're coming from [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9712.7s)]
*  As a [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9714.7s)]
*  Elected representative your situation [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9716.7s)]
*  Is a little bit different [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9718.7s)]
*  So you do constituent outreach all the time [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9720.7s)]
*  But I'll say it like this [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9722.7s)]
*  The resentments [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9724.7s)]
*  Weren't coming from [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9726.7s)]

*  Real concern or even a misunderstanding [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9730.7s)]
*  And more so their own demons that they're battling [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9732.7s)]
*  And in most circumstances [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9734.7s)]
*  I think that's what the problem is [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9736.7s)]
*  So I now have a policy of not really [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9738.7s)]
*  Entertaining it [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9740.7s)]

*  That's just being online that's different [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9746.7s)]
*  But it's a nice way of saying it [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9748.7s)]
*  Facing our own demons [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9750.7s)]

*  Something clever [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9764.7s)]

*  Very different [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9874.7s)]
*  I think New York Post [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9876.7s)]
*  Is one of those places where like if they have you in the cross stairs [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9878.7s)]
*  You're doing something right [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9880.7s)]
*  I want to give them another chance at the headline [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9882.7s)]
*  If they're glazing you [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9884.7s)]
*  You might be on the wrong trajectory [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9886.7s)]
*  I've gotten a couple hit pieces [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9888.7s)]

*  It's because [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9896.7s)]
*  Usually when you [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9898.7s)]
*  When you say anything [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9900.7s)]
*  Against Israel there's [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9902.7s)]
*  There's a network of [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9904.7s)]
*  Trolls and organizations that will [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9906.7s)]

*  Journalist and be like this guy's [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9910.7s)]
*  Dangerous you should write this article about them [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9912.7s)]
*  And I guess unfortunately [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9914.7s)]
*  For those guys real journalists [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9916.7s)]

*  This is amazing let's print this right now [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9924.7s)]
*  It's like New York Post [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9926.7s)]
*  Sometimes Fox News if they get a big get [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9928.7s)]
*  But [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9930.7s)]
*  That's like usually the bottom of the barrel [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9932.7s)]
*  But I still [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9934.7s)]

*  Their piece on that one [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9938.7s)]
*  One [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9940.7s)]
*  Israel supporter that had to go to rehab for eating [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9942.7s)]
*  Too much cheese [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9944.7s)]
*  That is my favorite [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9946.7s)]
*  That is my favorite piece of journalism [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9948.7s)]
*  Written this past year [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9950.7s)]
*  Because it was like cheese addiction [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9952.7s)]
*  She had cheese addiction [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9954.7s)]
*  And she relapsed because she was [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9956.7s)]
*  Upset that people on campus were saying [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9958.7s)]
*  So then she had to go back to rehab [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9960.7s)]
*  And it was $6,000 a week [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9962.7s)]
*  And I love that story [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9964.7s)]
*  Because I think the New York Post didn't write that [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9966.7s)]
*  To make fun of her [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9968.7s)]
*  But it's impossible to read that story [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9970.7s)]
*  And be like she's the [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9972.7s)]
*  Victim here [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9974.7s)]
*  She's the victim [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9976.7s)]
*  So they do have some hits every now and then [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9980.7s)]
*  A little bit more roast [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9992.7s)]
*  That chicken you said was really good [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=9996.7s)]
*  I ate [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10002.7s)]
*  What are they saying? [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10006.7s)]
*  So when did you start streaming? [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10010.7s)]
*  I started streaming in 2018 [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10012.7s)]
*  And I was doing [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10014.7s)]
*  Full time at the Young Turks and just like [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10016.7s)]
*  Kind of streaming whenever I had a moment [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10018.7s)]
*  And then I started taking it more seriously [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10020.7s)]
*  All the way in 2019 where [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10022.7s)]
*  It basically became like two full time jobs [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10024.7s)]
*  That I had, full time at the Young Turks and then [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10026.7s)]
*  Full time streaming like 6 hours every day [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10028.7s)]
*  And then 2020 I went full time [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10030.7s)]
*  Streaming and that's when I [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10032.7s)]
*  That's when I got a lot larger [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10034.7s)]
*  And streaming from the beginning has meant Twitch? [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10038.7s)]
*  Yeah [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10040.7s)]
*  Is that the only streaming platform? [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10042.7s)]
*  Well I mean you can live stream on YouTube as well [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10044.7s)]
*  But I sometimes [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10046.7s)]
*  Live stream on YouTube as well but [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10048.7s)]
*  I just do it on Twitch because that's just my primary [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10050.7s)]
*  Platform [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10052.7s)]
*  But Twitch is a live streaming platform [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10054.7s)]
*  Like the only thing you can do on there is live stream [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10056.7s)]
*  I feel like such an uncle asking these questions [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10058.7s)]
*  Yeah, no I mean it's normal [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10060.7s)]
*  Uncle representation [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10062.7s)]
*  Twitch is, it's not like [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10064.7s)]
*  It's a very popular platform but it's not like [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10066.7s)]
*  YouTube, you know what I mean? [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10068.7s)]
*  So yeah [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10070.7s)]
*  Do you have a set schedule? Like every day [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10072.7s)]
*  You're streaming this time exactly? [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10074.7s)]
*  Yeah 11am pacific [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10076.7s)]
*  7 days a week [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10078.7s)]
*  Sometimes I start off at 10am pacific [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10080.7s)]
*  Like today and yesterday [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10082.7s)]
*  But 11am pacific to 7pm pacific [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10084.7s)]
*  Every day [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10086.7s)]
*  So it's 8 hours at least every day [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10088.7s)]
*  7 days a week [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10090.7s)]
*  Working, you take a vacation? [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10092.7s)]
*  No but when I do [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10094.7s)]
*  Like my job is like a vacation [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10096.7s)]
*  I mean this is not a real job [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10098.7s)]
*  Or it doesn't feel like one [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10100.7s)]
*  So when I do end up [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10102.7s)]
*  Traveling, when I do end up traveling [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10104.7s)]
*  I will usually figure out a way to stream as well [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10106.7s)]
*  Like I have my remote desktop [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10108.7s)]
*  Set up everywhere I go [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10110.7s)]
*  So I can have like a sit [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10112.7s)]
*  Downstream if I want to and cover the news in the same [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10114.7s)]
*  Way that I would at my house [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10116.7s)]
*  And I have this rig here as well [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10118.7s)]

*  Battery on this [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10122.7s)]
*  I checked it was ok but it might be time [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10124.7s)]
*  69% [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10126.7s)]
*  69% [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10128.7s)]
*  Have we swapped it yet? [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10130.7s)]

*  The thing is though, whenever [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10218.7s)]
*  The issue is when people see it [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10220.7s)]
*  They're going to be like why do you have that? [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=10222.7s)]

*  I just don't even like talk about it in general [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11554.7s)]

*  Of dealing with it [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11572.7s)]

*  We practice at local police departments [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11580.7s)]
*  Where they know your address [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11582.7s)]

*  But aside from that [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11590.7s)]
*  Even then it's up to the discretion [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11592.7s)]
*  Of the watch commander [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11594.7s)]
*  If you got a gung ho watch commander that day [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11596.7s)]
*  You can still be impacted [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11598.7s)]
*  But although it's a crime [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11602.7s)]
*  A very serious crime [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11604.7s)]
*  It's quite difficult to deal with it [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11606.7s)]
*  Like there's legislation around it [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11608.7s)]
*  But [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11610.7s)]
*  It's hard to [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=11612.7s)]

*  Wait [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12096.7s)]
*  In LA that would be the case [[03:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12098.7s)]
*  Yeah there's like [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12102.7s)]
*  There's a famous [[03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12104.7s)]
*  LA had like a big [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12106.7s)]
*  Speak easy thing [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12108.7s)]
*  Where they would make like [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12110.7s)]
*  Storefronts that [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12112.7s)]
*  Just look like regular [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12114.7s)]
*  Storefronts [[03:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12116.7s)]
*  Yeah like you go to the laundromat [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12118.7s)]
*  Yeah no Laurel Hardware used to be like [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12120.7s)]
*  It looked like a hardware store from the outside [[03:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12122.7s)]
*  It doesn't even look like that now [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12124.7s)]
*  But back in the day it used to look like a hardware store [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12126.7s)]
*  But it was not it was a restaurant [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12128.7s)]
*  Laurel Hardware [[03:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12130.7s)]

*  You also let me know if you need to go [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12138.7s)]
*  Before there's a bunch of places we can stop [[03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12140.7s)]
*  No no it's fine [[03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12142.7s)]
*  Shout out to mom's kitchen [[03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12146.7s)]
*  We can't give locations [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12148.7s)]
*  It's too late [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12150.7s)]
*  You've been shouting out every crossroad [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12152.7s)]
*  As we pass it [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12154.7s)]
*  Like a GPS [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12156.7s)]
*  Really excited [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12158.7s)]
*  To be here [[03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12160.7s)]
*  In an unspecified location [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12162.7s)]
*  Yeah [[03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12166.7s)]

*  Everybody forgets it [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12180.7s)]
*  It's okay it's not the end of the world [[03:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12182.7s)]
*  People are nice [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12184.7s)]
*  It's cool [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12186.7s)]
*  Okay [[03:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12190.7s)]
*  You're welcome [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12196.7s)]
*  You're welcome [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12198.7s)]
*  Okay [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12200.7s)]
*  Kidding [[03:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12202.7s)]
*  Just taking every ounce of my body [[03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12214.7s)]
*  Not to shout out [[03:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12216.7s)]
*  I can tell [[03:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12218.7s)]
*  I love you guys [[03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12220.7s)]
*  Do you normally do that? [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12222.7s)]
*  I just love sharing all these spots with people [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12224.7s)]
*  What are the spots here that you like? [[03:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12226.7s)]
*  You can say it's fine [[03:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12228.7s)]
*  Okay have you ever had burek? [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12230.7s)]
*  Burek? Yeah [[03:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12232.7s)]
*  What am I doing here? [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12234.7s)]
*  I'm trying to appropriate your culture [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12236.7s)]
*  What kind of burek is it? [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12238.7s)]
*  Jerdan [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12240.7s)]
*  Is it Armenian? [[03:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12242.7s)]
*  No I think it's [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12244.7s)]
*  Formerly Yugoslavian [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12246.7s)]
*  Oh okay [[03:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12248.7s)]
*  I'm not sure which specific country today [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12250.7s)]
*  Great burek [[03:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12252.7s)]
*  And also a big fan [[03:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12254.7s)]
*  Milk Flair has some great pizza [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12256.7s)]
*  And there's an open street [[03:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12260.7s)]
*  That's on this block [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12262.7s)]
*  That is great [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12264.7s)]
*  Weekends they'll pedestrianize the block [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12266.7s)]
*  Kids will come out [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12268.7s)]
*  Families [[03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12270.7s)]
*  It's really nice, it's really great work [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12272.7s)]
*  It's work that should be [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12274.7s)]
*  Funded more by the city but instead [[03:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12276.7s)]
*  Is on the hands of a lot of these incredible volunteers [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12278.7s)]
*  Improving foot traffic [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12282.7s)]
*  Especially in a place like New York [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12284.7s)]
*  Is fairly easy [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12286.7s)]
*  This is one of the more walkable cities [[03:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12288.7s)]
*  It's just a question of political will [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12290.7s)]
*  With congestion pricing [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12292.7s)]
*  You could pedestrianize much of that zone [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12294.7s)]
*  And you should [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12296.7s)]
*  We've actually seen that foot traffic has increased [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12298.7s)]
*  As part of the implementation [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12300.7s)]
*  Barcelona did it [[03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12302.7s)]
*  There's so many viable examples [[03:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12304.7s)]
*  In Europe [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12306.7s)]
*  Where people are using the road [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12308.7s)]
*  In Europe [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12310.7s)]
*  Especially the infrastructure is ready [[03:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12312.7s)]
*  For it [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12314.7s)]
*  And New York is a perfect fit for that [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12316.7s)]
*  I think Chicago, Philadelphia [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12318.7s)]
*  There are many cities where you could do that [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12320.7s)]
*  And I think even if you're, like we were talking about bus travel before [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12322.7s)]
*  Bogota moves [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12324.7s)]
*  40,000 people in an hour [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12326.7s)]
*  On bus rapid transit [[03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12328.7s)]
*  That's what we could be doing here [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12330.7s)]
*  Is that kind of speed [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12332.7s)]
*  To actually deliver people to where they're going [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12334.7s)]
*  But you know buses [[03:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12336.7s)]
*  In parts of Manhattan [[03:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12338.7s)]
*  The average bus speed is [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12340.7s)]
*  Like 5.8 miles an hour [[03:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12342.7s)]
*  Like we're going at 6 right now [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12344.7s)]
*  And the average speed overall is about 8 [[03:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12346.7s)]
*  Why are they so slow? [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12348.7s)]
*  A lot of congestion [[03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12350.7s)]
*  Also the city has not built out [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12352.7s)]
*  The bus lanes that's legally required to do so [[03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12354.7s)]
*  Eric Adams has just torn it up every time a wealthy donor [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12356.7s)]
*  Has said that they don't want a bus lane [[03:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12358.7s)]
*  Like in the Bronx the Botanical Garden [[03:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12360.7s)]
*  Called Eric Adams' administration [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12362.7s)]
*  To say they didn't want a Fordham Road busway [[03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12364.7s)]
*  And then they just didn't do it [[03:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12366.7s)]
*  And this is just like the [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12368.7s)]
*  Why didn't they want it? [[03:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12370.7s)]
*  Because it's [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12372.7s)]
*  So much of this false narrative [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12374.7s)]
*  That if you actually [[03:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12376.7s)]
*  Yeah if you build this bus [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12378.7s)]
*  Then you're going to reduce the traffic [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12380.7s)]
*  To these institutions when in fact [[03:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12382.7s)]
*  It moves people faster [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12384.7s)]
*  And also foot traffic is a critical part of all of this [[03:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12386.7s)]
*  I just don't understand [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12388.7s)]
*  This is a very American [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12390.7s)]
*  This is a very American attitude [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12392.7s)]
*  It's just anywhere else on the planet [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12394.7s)]
*  If you were to suggest [[03:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12396.7s)]
*  One additional lane for traffic [[03:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12398.7s)]
*  They would be like what are you talking about? [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12400.7s)]
*  And I think in New York City we have a history [[03:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12402.7s)]
*  Of being able to move people [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12404.7s)]
*  In public transit [[03:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12406.7s)]
*  It's just that we haven't had mayors [[03:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12408.7s)]
*  Especially this current one [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12410.7s)]
*  That wants to do anything about it [[03:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12412.7s)]
*  I mean alright [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12414.7s)]
*  I would say about 2.5 blocks [[03:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12416.7s)]
*  Okay [[03:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12418.7s)]
*  A bunch of people have been out [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12420.7s)]

*  Okay [[03:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12792.7s)]
*  Let me show you where the [[03:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12794.7s)]
*  The bathroom [[03:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12800.7s)]
*  Is straight to the back [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12802.7s)]
*  To the left [[03:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12804.7s)]
*  I'm just going to leave my jacket here [[03:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12806.7s)]
*  Andrew, can you [[03:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12808.7s)]

*  And then I'm going to [[03:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12812.7s)]

*  And then [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12830.7s)]
*  Regular sugar, yeah [[03:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12832.7s)]
*  And then could I have one pot of Mufawa? [[03:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12834.7s)]
*  Regular sugar as well? [[03:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12836.7s)]
*  Regular sugar, yeah [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12838.7s)]
*  Actually, you know what [[03:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12840.7s)]
*  Let's just do the Mufawa [[03:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12842.7s)]
*  Mufawa? [[03:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12844.7s)]
*  Thank you so much [[03:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12846.7s)]
*  Straight down, straight down and then take a left [[03:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12848.7s)]
*  Thank you so much [[03:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12856.7s)]
*  I think we're good [[03:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12866.7s)]
*  I think we're good [[03:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12868.7s)]
*  I've just ordered [[03:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12870.7s)]
*  We'll have some chai [[03:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12872.7s)]
*  And then I want to take you one more place [[03:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12874.7s)]
*  You tell me when you guys are going to wrap it up [[03:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12876.7s)]
*  It's up to him [[03:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12878.7s)]
*  But I've ordered a pot [[03:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12880.7s)]
*  So we all have to have a little bit [[03:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12882.7s)]
*  Yeah [[03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12884.7s)]
*  I'm going to take a little bit [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12886.7s)]
*  I'm going to take a little bit [[03:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12888.7s)]
*  I'm going to take a little bit [[03:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12890.7s)]
*  I'm going to take a little bit [[03:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12892.7s)]
*  I'll definitely get some coffee [[03:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12894.7s)]
*  Yeah [[03:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12896.7s)]
*  You got chai or coffee? [[03:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12898.7s)]
*  I got coffee. I want to leave chai for the next place [[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12900.7s)]
*  Hello chat [[03:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12908.7s)]
*  Come on in [[03:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12910.7s)]
*  Okay, when did you get this t-shirt? [[03:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12912.7s)]
*  I like it [[03:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12914.7s)]
*  It's incredible [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12916.7s)]
*  I actually went to this, I was probably... [[03:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12918.7s)]
*  Wait, so did you grow up in New York City? [[03:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12925.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, I grew up on Long Island. [[03:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12926.7s)]
*  Okay. [[03:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12927.7s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately. [[03:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12928.7s)]
*  When did you move to New York City? [[03:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12929.7s)]
*  I've been here for... [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12930.7s)]
*  Strong Island. [[03:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12931.7s)]
*  Strong, don't say that. [[03:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12932.7s)]
*  We're on Strong Island, you probably... [[03:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12933.7s)]
*  Like, Huntington? [[03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12934.7s)]
*  Okay, yeah, yeah. [[03:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12935.7s)]
*  North Shore? [[03:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12936.7s)]
*  No, I just wanted to say hi. [[03:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12937.7s)]
*  Oh, thanks so much. [[03:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12938.7s)]
*  Good luck in the race, man. [[03:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12939.7s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[03:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12940.7s)]
*  What's your name? [[03:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12941.7s)]
*  Nahia. [[03:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12942.7s)]
*  Nahia. [[03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12943.7s)]
*  Nice to meet you, man. [[03:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12945.7s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[03:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12946.7s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12947.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12948.7s)]
*  Hey, welcome to Islam. [[03:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12949.7s)]
*  I'm from the American City, but... [[03:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12950.7s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[03:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12951.7s)]
*  Thank you so much, Dorie. [[03:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12952.7s)]
*  Thank you so much, habibi. [[03:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12953.7s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[03:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12954.7s)]
*  Damn, Islam here? [[03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12955.7s)]
*  Yeah, he's just in the bathroom. [[03:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12956.7s)]
*  We hope for him to be back soon. [[03:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12957.7s)]
*  We hope, but we don't know how. [[03:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12958.7s)]
*  We leave it open. [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12959.7s)]
*  You smile all the time. [[03:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12960.7s)]
*  Is it hard? [[03:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12961.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard. [[03:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12962.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[03:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12963.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[03:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12964.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[03:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12965.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[03:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12966.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[03:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12967.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[03:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12968.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12969.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[03:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12970.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[03:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12971.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[03:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12972.7s)]
*  Is it hard? [[03:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12973.7s)]
*  No, it's just the way of life. [[03:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12974.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12975.7s)]
*  Do you feel happy? [[03:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12976.7s)]
*  Yeah, I would say my general disposition. [[03:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12977.7s)]
*  That's tough. [[03:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12980.7s)]
*  How do you do that? [[03:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12981.7s)]
*  How do you maintain that? [[03:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12982.7s)]
*  Honestly, it isn't a choice. [[03:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12983.7s)]
*  It feels more like the natural state, and the choice is synonymous. [[03:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12987.7s)]
*  I think it would be pretty exhausting to choose, as always. [[03:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12993.7s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff to smile about, a lot of things to fight for, but smiles are on the way. [[03:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=12997.7s)]
*  What are the books that really impacted you? [[03:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13002.7s)]
*  Books that impacted me? [[03:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13006.7s)]
*  Have you ever read Civil War by Omar Al-Aqad? [[03:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13011.7s)]
*  No. [[03:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13015.7s)]
*  It's a great book. [[03:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13016.7s)]
*  It's a great book. [[03:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13017.7s)]
*  It's a book written about the terrifying prospect of a civil war in our country, and it had [[03:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13019.7s)]
*  this line that said, what is safety but the sound of bombs dropping on someone else's [[03:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13026.7s)]
*  home? [[03:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13033.7s)]
*  It always stuck with me. [[03:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13034.7s)]
*  I think also reading Fanon when I was in college was really formative. [[03:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13035.7s)]
*  Black skin, white masks, wretched of the earth. [[03:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13039.7s)]
*  Then my father wrote a book called From Citizen to Refugee. [[03:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13047.7s)]
*  It's about the last 90 days he lived in Uganda before the expulsion and the first 90 days [[03:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13052.7s)]
*  he lived as a refugee in London. [[03:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13056.7s)]
*  And your father is a civil refugee? [[03:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13058.7s)]
*  He's an academic. [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13060.7s)]
*  He did like Neo-Greek Anticolonial? [[03:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13061.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think his most famous book on that is probably Citizen Subject, and a lot of [[03:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13065.7s)]
*  work about the post-colonial state. [[03:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13075.7s)]
*  And he memorably, he was introduced by the FBI to Karl Marx. [[03:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13079.7s)]
*  That was his trajectory into political theory. [[03:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13086.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, I heard that on the interview you did with Chavo. [[03:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13088.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13090.7s)]
*  It's a fun way. [[03:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13091.7s)]
*  Definitely not a successful outcome, I think, for that visit. [[03:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13093.7s)]
*  This institution you know is run by people from the MENA region who got bidets. [[03:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13098.7s)]
*  Let's go. [[03:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13104.7s)]
*  But they got the manual bidets, which I don't like. [[03:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13105.7s)]
*  What do you want? [[03:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13107.7s)]
*  Which is... [[03:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13108.7s)]
*  You want the auto? [[03:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13109.7s)]
*  Well, not the auto, but like just the bidet that's in the toilet instead of like a washing... [[03:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13110.7s)]
*  You don't want the showers. [[03:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13114.7s)]
*  I don't like the shower head. [[03:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13115.7s)]
*  Muslim showers. [[03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13116.7s)]
*  I don't understand the Muslim shower head. [[03:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13117.7s)]
*  In Turkey? [[03:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13118.7s)]
*  Yeah, in Turkey we have bidets in every toilet. [[03:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13119.7s)]
*  Which brings me to a very important proposal. [[03:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13122.7s)]
*  Hit it, hit it, hit it. [[03:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13125.7s)]
*  Okay. [[03:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13127.7s)]
*  Every toilet, every business that wants to get bidets, and I know they're doing public [[03:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13129.7s)]
*  toilets as well, public restrooms as well. [[03:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13134.7s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13138.7s)]
*  They need to have bidets. [[03:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13139.7s)]
*  I think Americans are oblivious and dare I say barbaric for not having bidets. [[03:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13141.7s)]
*  It shocks me to my very... [[03:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13152.7s)]
*  It shocks me to my very core that this concept is not established in the Western world. [[03:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13155.7s)]
*  It blows my mind. [[03:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13161.7s)]
*  And I know for a fact that Americans like it when they encounter it because a buddy [[03:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13163.7s)]
*  of mine, Ludwig, he white boy from New Hampshire. [[03:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13168.7s)]
*  Shout out Ludwig. [[03:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13172.7s)]
*  His name is Ludwig Augrey. [[03:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13173.7s)]
*  He's the whitest dude of all time. [[03:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13174.7s)]
*  And he started selling bidets as a YouTuber and people love it. [[03:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13176.7s)]
*  How did he get into the bidet business? [[03:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13180.7s)]
*  I think he's a weeb, that's why. [[03:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13182.7s)]
*  Maybe a meeb? [[03:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13186.7s)]
*  No, weeb, a weebo, like a fan of Japan. [[03:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13187.7s)]

*  Good to see you guys. [[03:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13193.7s)]
*  This is real power plays right here, Chad. [[03:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13195.7s)]
*  Okay, this is how politics are done at the highest level. [[03:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13197.7s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[03:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13200.7s)]
*  I want every American to be clean. [[03:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13201.7s)]
*  And I feel like it's ridiculous that they don't have bays. [[03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13205.7s)]
*  This is where it starts, at the ground level. [[03:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13210.7s)]
*  It's not about universal healthcare. [[03:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13212.7s)]
*  It's not about public housing. [[03:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13215.7s)]
*  It's about making sure that a marriage experience that comforts, [[03:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13218.7s)]
*  dare I say, the luxury that every proletarian deserves. [[03:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13224.7s)]
*  Every proletarian bud deserves a bidet. [[03:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13230.7s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[03:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13233.7s)]

*  Okay. [[03:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13252.7s)]
*  This is Mufawwad. [[03:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13253.7s)]
*  What is it? [[03:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13255.7s)]
*  Mufawwad. [[03:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13256.7s)]
*  Mufawwad. [[03:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13257.7s)]
*  It's a coffee. [[03:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13258.7s)]
*  There's also chai coming up next. [[03:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13259.7s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to have a little sip. [[03:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13262.7s)]
*  You tell me when. [[03:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13263.7s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[03:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13264.7s)]
*  This is way past the point of when. [[03:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13265.7s)]
*  Okay, we got two extra. [[03:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13267.7s)]
*  You want to grab two more cups? [[03:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13279.7s)]
*  There's a lot of this. [[03:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13286.7s)]
*  Do you want some coffee? [[03:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13287.7s)]
*  Can you remind me of Marge's name? [[03:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13290.7s)]
*  Marge, do you want some coffee? [[03:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13293.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13294.7s)]
*  We're going to get more cups as well. [[03:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13295.7s)]
*  You drink coffee at 9 p.m. and you don't fall asleep? [[03:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13302.7s)]
*  Come on. [[03:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13305.7s)]
*  That's why I love coffee. [[03:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13306.7s)]
*  But I feel like if I drank it, if I drank a full cup, I would die. [[03:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13307.7s)]
*  I would not be able to go to sleep at all. [[03:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13310.7s)]
*  Do you like some coffee? [[03:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13312.7s)]
*  We're getting more cups. [[03:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13313.7s)]
*  There's more than enough for everybody. [[03:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13314.7s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[03:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13316.7s)]
*  Okay, I think we might even need more. [[03:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13319.7s)]
*  One for you. [[03:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13321.7s)]
*  One more? [[03:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13322.7s)]
*  I think once. [[03:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13323.7s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you can ask. [[03:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13324.7s)]
*  It's a safe stuff. [[03:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13325.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'll go. [[03:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13326.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13327.7s)]
*  Even two more. [[03:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13328.7s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[03:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13329.7s)]
*  That's really good. [[03:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13330.7s)]
*  Does that card come up in there? [[03:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13331.7s)]
*  This is not a plug for my failed rap career. [[03:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13332.7s)]
*  Anyway, as I was saying, I think this is a real winner. [[03:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13335.7s)]
*  I think Americans need to entertain the idea of having a clean butt. [[03:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13340.7s)]
*  Look, I think bidets are a great thing. [[03:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13346.7s)]
*  And it's cheap. [[03:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13350.7s)]
*  It's like for 20 bucks, you can put one of those things where you just change the seat up. [[03:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13351.7s)]
*  So would that be... [[03:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13355.7s)]
*  Oh! [[03:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13357.7s)]
*  Okay. [[03:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13358.7s)]
*  Okay. [[03:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13359.7s)]
*  Nothing broke. [[03:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13360.7s)]
*  Okay. [[03:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13361.7s)]
*  All right. [[03:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13362.7s)]
*  All right. [[03:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13363.7s)]
*  And also it wasn't on camera. [[03:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13364.7s)]
*  That's crazy. [[03:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13365.7s)]
*  That's crazy work. [[03:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13366.7s)]
*  It's crazy how it's like a full... [[03:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13367.7s)]
*  We got a couple extra coffees for anybody. [[03:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13369.7s)]
*  Donald, would you mind just taking one of these over there to that table? [[03:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13373.7s)]
*  They might want something. [[03:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13378.7s)]
*  So what's... [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13379.7s)]
*  Hold on. [[03:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13380.7s)]
*  Let me see if I can nail it. [[03:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13381.7s)]
*  Hit it. [[03:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13382.7s)]
*  This is a great jacket, by the way. [[03:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13383.7s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[03:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13386.7s)]
*  The aftertaste resembles... [[03:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13389.7s)]
*  I mean, it's like very... [[03:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13393.7s)]
*  A very specific... [[03:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13395.7s)]
*  Very specific spice in this. [[03:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13397.7s)]
*  It's not just the coffee that tastes this way. [[03:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13399.7s)]
*  There's something in this. [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13401.7s)]
*  There's a cardamom... [[03:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13402.7s)]
*  Oh, is it cardamom? [[03:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13403.7s)]
*  There's a cardamom in this. [[03:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13405.7s)]
*  What's the thing that people put in Persian food? [[03:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13407.7s)]
*  It's like a... [[03:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13411.7s)]
*  Raisins? [[03:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13412.7s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[03:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13413.7s)]
*  It's like a spice. [[03:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13414.7s)]
*  It's the most expensive spice. [[03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13415.7s)]
*  Saffron. [[03:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13417.7s)]
*  Saffron. [[03:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13418.7s)]
*  Is there saffron in this? [[03:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13419.7s)]
*  Let me go check. [[03:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13420.7s)]
*  I'll look at the board. [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13421.7s)]
*  I'm just saying it has like an aftertaste that is similar to saffron. [[03:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13423.7s)]
*  Wait, we can just Google it. [[03:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13427.7s)]
*  I don't know why we're... [[03:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13428.7s)]
*  That means it's not mine, possibly. [[03:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13430.7s)]
*  Sorry. [[03:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13434.7s)]
*  It's probably not saffron. [[03:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13435.7s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I met you once at my friend's house in Staten Island. [[03:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13437.7s)]
*  Oh, yes, yes, yes. [[03:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13443.7s)]
*  Are you doing a very small video? [[03:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13444.7s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[03:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13445.7s)]
*  I'm doing my card. [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13446.7s)]
*  I'm running for a wall of this. [[03:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13447.7s)]
*  I'm running for city council. [[03:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13448.7s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[03:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13449.7s)]
*  Oh, awesome, man. [[03:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13450.7s)]

*  I've been hitting the bus a lot, but trains are my first love. [[03:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13650.539999999999s)]
*  Shout out to the subways. [[03:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13654.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13656.539999999999s)]
*  Have you ridden the train? [[03:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13657.539999999999s)]

*  Yes. [[03:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13661.38s)]
*  Which lines? [[03:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13662.38s)]

*  What's your favorite and your least favorite subway line? [[03:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13668.3s)]
*  Least favorite is the L. [[03:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13670.58s)]
*  Least favorite is the L. [[03:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13671.58s)]
*  Least favorite has to be the L. [[03:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13672.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13673.58s)]
*  Favorite is the L. [[03:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13674.58s)]
*  Why is the L the least favorite for you? [[03:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13675.58s)]
*  Because when the train is down, you're not getting out of the road. [[03:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13677.1s)]
*  But it's also one of the most reliable. [[03:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13680.1s)]
*  Above 90% reliability. [[03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13682.1s)]
*  I guess, I don't know. [[03:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13683.1s)]
*  The L is pretty reliable. [[03:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13684.1s)]
*  The L and the 7 are the most reliable trains in the subway system. [[03:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13685.1s)]
*  Because they have modern signaling. [[03:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13690.02s)]
*  Other trains don't. [[03:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13691.02s)]
*  A lot of other ones. [[03:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13692.02s)]
*  I live in Marlowe. [[03:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13693.02s)]

*  They're doing construction on it now, like all the time. [[03:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13713.460000000001s)]
*  There's a lot. [[03:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13716.460000000001s)]
*  I mean, the 1 is one of the more reliable trains, but it's still, like, the weekends [[03:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13717.460000000001s)]
*  when so many people actually also want to get on the train, it's just completely hamstrung [[03:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13725.1s)]
*  by all of these regular construction delays. [[03:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13729.1s)]

*  Do you want more? [[03:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13747.82s)]
*  One of the immediate improvements in the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12, [[03:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13748.82s)]

*  Do you want coffee? [[03:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13753.82s)]
*  Do you want coffee? [[03:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13756.82s)]
*  I have one cup. [[03:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13757.82s)]
*  Do you want more? [[03:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13758.82s)]
*  I have one cup. [[03:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13759.82s)]
*  One of the immediate improvements I feel like for any subway is the cages. [[03:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13760.82s)]
*  I don't know why they don't do that. [[03:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13766.82s)]
*  The cages. [[03:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13768.82s)]
*  Cages. [[03:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13769.82s)]
*  Oh, on the platforms? [[03:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13770.82s)]
*  In a lot of the lines in Tokyo where if there's ever any sort of someone jumping in front [[03:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13771.82s)]
*  of the train or whatever because that happens, obviously, they immediately just will put, [[03:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13776.82s)]
*  will put safeguards. [[03:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13781.82s)]
*  I don't know why we don't do that. [[03:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13782.82s)]
*  Is it because the trains are different? [[03:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13785.82s)]
*  Like the car sizes are different or something? [[03:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13786.82s)]
*  I think some of it, there have been some attempts at putting like halfway barriers. [[03:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13788.82s)]
*  Like if you go at Times Square, there's some platforms where you have like a partial barrier [[03:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13792.82s)]
*  that's about maybe waist high. [[03:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13797.82s)]
*  Yeah, but it's, I mean, ultimately it's not the same as what you're talking about, which [[03:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13800.82s)]
*  I think is a glass barrier, right? [[03:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13804.82s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's different ways of doing it. [[03:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13805.82s)]
*  You can either have like, you can either have like a like above the waist barrier with [[03:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13807.82s)]
*  like a gate that opens up or you can have like a full gate that is completely enclosed. [[03:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13811.82s)]
*  And when the train comes, the only part that opens up is basically the doors of the train. [[03:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13817.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13821.82s)]
*  And I mean, in many modern, in many modernized nations, they have it. [[03:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13822.82s)]
*  Hi. [[03:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13830.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13834.82s)]
*  Thank you, my man. [[03:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13835.82s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[03:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13836.82s)]
*  I feel like that would immediately address a major issue that people have, especially [[03:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13839.82s)]
*  because from what I understand, I look at the stats. [[03:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13845.82s)]
*  It's a weird one to even say out loud, but like the murder per commuter rate is actually [[03:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13848.82s)]
*  fairly low. [[03:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13854.82s)]
*  Like even in New York. [[03:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13856.82s)]
*  The rate of violent crime. [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13857.82s)]
*  Yeah, the rate of violent crime in the New York subway system is not as high as people [[03:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13858.82s)]
*  think it is. [[03:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13865.82s)]
*  There is definitely hysteria surrounding it. [[03:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13866.82s)]
*  But because of the type of crime, it's very visible and, you know, it's understandable [[03:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13868.82s)]
*  to people, what the hell is this? [[03:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13874.82s)]
*  People feel quite anxious. [[03:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13875.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13876.82s)]
*  And I feel like approaching that anxiety in a way, or it's like a very easy solution. [[03:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13877.82s)]
*  Instead of doing overtime pay for cops, you could literally build those barriers and [[03:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13882.82s)]
*  that's a job, you know? [[03:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13887.82s)]
*  No, I think it's something that, where there was an initial feasibility study that came [[03:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13889.82s)]
*  out with an incredibly high cost estimate. [[03:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13893.82s)]
*  I think that's also part of the problem where... [[03:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13896.82s)]
*  Wait, for the barriers? [[03:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13898.82s)]
*  For the barriers. [[03:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13899.82s)]
*  And I think that's part of the problem for the MTA is that Cuomo cut their internal capacity [[03:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13900.82s)]
*  to build and to design. [[03:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13905.82s)]
*  Oh, so then... [[03:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13907.82s)]
*  So it's all consultant based. [[03:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13908.82s)]
*  So much of it is consultant-reliant. [[03:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13909.82s)]
*  Everything is public-private partnership. [[03:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13911.82s)]
*  Everything. [[03:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13912.82s)]
*  I mean, there has to be...we have to actually develop the ability to build things without [[03:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13913.82s)]
*  having to rely on external consultants. [[03:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13919.82s)]
*  What do you think about Paris, where they've done some of these policies, like right of [[03:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13921.82s)]
*  first refusal, like giving the cities the opportunity to buy buildings back, and they're [[03:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13927.82s)]
*  getting sold, you know, like the entire buildings. [[03:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13932.82s)]
*  I mean, that's fascinating. [[03:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13935.82s)]
*  I mean, I think there has to be a much more muscular role that the city plays in making [[03:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13936.82s)]
*  sure people live in habitable conditions. [[03:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13943.82s)]
*  Right. [[03:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13945.82s)]
*  And a lot of that also has to do with what we were talking about earlier, where if you [[03:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13946.82s)]
*  have a landlord that's repeatedly violated the law and refused to pay fines and refused [[03:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13949.82s)]
*  to make fixes, then the city has the ability to reclaim that building. [[03:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13953.82s)]
*  And I also think that there's also an incredible amount of publicly owned land that you could [[03:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13957.82s)]
*  construct fully affordable housing on, that instead we just either let it sit vacant or [[03:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13962.82s)]
*  put it to far less productive uses. [[03:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13969.82s)]
*  And I think, you know, even when we're thinking about the subway, a lot of the cost of subway's [[03:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13971.82s)]
*  underground construction, but there are also potential subway extensions that would be [[03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13976.82s)]
*  above ground, far more feasible, because ultimately this is a system that we haven't really had [[03:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13981.82s)]
*  a massive expansion of in decades. [[03:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13986.82s)]
*  I mean, the second avenue subway is the last one, and because of Andrew Cuomo, it was so [[03:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13989.82s)]
*  expensive. [[03:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13992.82s)]
*  Is part of the problem that there is this dynamic where the MTA, like some of the money [[03:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=13994.82s)]
*  or a lot of the money of the MTA is controlled by this board? [[03:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14000.82s)]
*  I would say more of the dynamic is the MTA is a state authority. [[03:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14005.82s)]
*  When Andrew Cuomo was the governor of New York, he tried to pretend that it was actually [[03:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14008.82s)]
*  a city responsibility. [[03:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14012.82s)]
*  He would pretend that it had nothing to do with him, and he tried to use New Yorker's [[03:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14013.82s)]
*  association of the subway with the city to say that in fact it was de Blasio's responsibility. [[03:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14017.82s)]
*  And whatever critiques you want to make of de Blasio, he did not run the MTA. [[03:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14022.82s)]
*  That was Andrew Cuomo's responsibility, and what Andrew Cuomo did was systematically [[03:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14026.82s)]
*  underfunded, stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. [[03:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14030.82s)]
*  One year, he took money from the MTA's budget and sent it to upstate ski resorts that had [[03:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14032.82s)]
*  a bad winter. [[03:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14038.82s)]
*  That's how he spent money. [[03:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14039.82s)]
*  And then it came to a height in 2017, which is called the summer of hell, where you had [[03:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14040.82s)]
*  just an immense amount of disruption that took place across the system with some of [[03:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14045.82s)]
*  these memorable images, like an F train stuck in the tunnel for 30 minutes, pulling into [[03:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14049.82s)]
*  the station, fog in the windows, people desperate to get out. [[03:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14052.82s)]
*  And that was a natural result of Andrew Cuomo's mismanagement of the MTA. [[03:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14057.82s)]
*  And that's what's so frustrating is like, I love public transit, and I also think we [[03:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14061.82s)]
*  are so far from world-class public transit in our city because we have allowed a politics [[03:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14066.82s)]
*  of patronage, consulting, and competence to mix together to force people to celebrate [[03:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14072.82s)]
*  what they know could actually be better. [[03:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14077.82s)]
*  Any sort of competent social program creates a sense of pride in the public, even if it's [[03:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14083.82s)]
*  being underfunded consistently. [[03:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14089.82s)]
*  Like the example I always think of is nationalized health care in the UK. [[03:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14091.82s)]
*  Regardless of the many issues that it has, due to the underfunding and the systematic [[03:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14097.82s)]
*  state of disrepair that it's turned into by politicians who want to inevitably privatize [[03:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14103.82s)]
*  pieces of it so they're implementing austerity in the short term, people still have a pride [[03:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14109.82s)]
*  in their NHS. [[03:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14114.82s)]
*  They still love it. [[03:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14116.82s)]
*  I think they don't even have like an NHS day or something. [[03:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14117.82s)]
*  And I feel like if given the opportunity, like New Yorkers would probably be very proud [[03:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14120.82s)]
*  of their subway system, you know, but as it stands currently, it's just the images that [[03:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14125.82s)]
*  they think of are like how difficult it is and how unreliable it is. [[03:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14132.82s)]
*  I mean, it could be so much more. [[03:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14138.82s)]
*  And I think what's frustrating is that it's all quite obvious. [[03:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14140.82s)]
*  We could have New Yorkers be and feel safe on our subways by implementing these evidence-proven [[03:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14147.82s)]
*  strategies that would actually counter the level, the feeling of vacancy that's endemic [[03:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14153.82s)]
*  in this system, where you have commercial units that are now vacant, you have senses [[03:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14158.82s)]
*  that there's nobody out there looking out for you on the platform or in the middle of [[03:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14162.82s)]
*  the station. [[03:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14166.82s)]
*  And a lot of it is just there's been like a reverse New York exceptionalism that we've [[03:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14167.82s)]
*  seen a lot of people trot out where it's like, oh, the stuff that's worked elsewhere, we [[03:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14173.82s)]
*  could never do it here. [[03:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14176.82s)]
*  I remember at the height of COVID Cuomo was saying that is because that's American. [[03:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14177.82s)]
*  That's the most American attitude in general. [[03:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14181.82s)]
*  I mean, I feel like we've definitely taken the cake here. [[03:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14183.82s)]
*  I want to take you guys for the final stop. [[03:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14187.82s)]
*  All right. [[03:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14189.82s)]
*  I'm going to just finish up this coffee for everybody. [[03:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14190.82s)]
*  All right. [[03:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14199.82s)]
*  Final. [[03:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14200.82s)]
*  For somebody. [[03:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14201.82s)]
*  It doesn't have to be you. [[03:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14202.82s)]
*  We're leading right now. [[03:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14203.82s)]
*  European market crashing. [[03:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14204.82s)]
*  Oh, no. [[03:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14205.82s)]
*  We've got to get her in a picture with Osama. [[03:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14206.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14208.82s)]
*  Erin, let's go. [[03:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14209.82s)]
*  Let's do it now. [[03:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14210.82s)]
*  This has been wonderful. [[03:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14211.82s)]
*  Dude, I've had such a great time. [[03:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14213.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14216.82s)]
*  No. [[03:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14217.82s)]
*  Chatters are loving it. [[03:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14218.82s)]
*  Shout out to the chatters. [[03:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14219.82s)]
*  Apparently, apparently stock market's opening in Asia. [[03:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14220.82s)]
*  Not looking too great. [[03:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14225.82s)]
*  Is that related to this stream? [[03:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14227.82s)]
*  No, they're just informing me. [[03:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14229.82s)]
*  No, I was planning on maybe staying an extra day tomorrow to see, to like go to Wall Street [[03:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14231.82s)]
*  and stream outside of Wall Street. [[03:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14237.82s)]
*  Why not? [[03:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14239.82s)]
*  Right from the source. [[03:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14240.82s)]
*  I miss my dog and my family. [[03:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14241.82s)]
*  Also very important. [[03:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14243.82s)]

*  Another part of it. [[04:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14569.06s)]
*  We have to go through it. [[04:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14570.38s)]
*  Who is that? [[04:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14572.86s)]
*  Okay, if you just send the press [[04:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14573.7s)]
*  that's on the NYC.com, [[04:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14575.3s)]
*  then, then. [[04:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14576.98s)]
*  The thing that's at least nice about New York also, [[04:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14579.14s)]
*  is no matter where you go, [[04:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14582.78s)]
*  is that at least the stores are open. [[04:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14583.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[04:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14586.78s)]
*  And not even because of the, [[04:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14588.34s)]
*  not even, like even at 9 p.m., [[04:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14589.58s)]
*  but in general, [[04:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14591.32s)]
*  I feel like there's so many parts of even LA, [[04:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14592.4s)]
*  where back in the day, [[04:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14596.64s)]
*  there used to be a lot of storefronts, [[04:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14599.36s)]
*  and now they're just all closed down. [[04:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14600.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think especially- [[04:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14602.48s)]
*  People are still working. [[04:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14603.84s)]
*  And I think it's partially because there's foot traffic. [[04:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14604.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you should come, [[04:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14607.039999999999s)]
*  you should come back to Sineway during Ramadan. [[04:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14608.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, this is a very, [[04:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14611.64s)]
*  this is like a very Muslim- [[04:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14614.36s)]
*  Yeah, this is one of the hardest, [[04:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14615.56s)]
*  I would say, Muslim New York City. [[04:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14616.44s)]
*  Okay. [[04:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14617.68s)]
*  Especially starting from here, 28th Avenue. [[04:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14618.52s)]
*  I'm going north to 25th on Sineway. [[04:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14621.64s)]
*  One of the names for where we are is Little Egypt. [[04:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14626.36s)]
*  And it's just a beautiful, [[04:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=14631.52s)]

*  obviously down to the customer. [[04:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15621.320000000002s)]
*  And you have a lot of people who are selling [[04:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15623.320000000002s)]
*  $10 plates of chicken and rice, [[04:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15625.480000000001s)]
*  who would be selling it at $8 [[04:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15627.76s)]
*  if the city actually issued them the permits. [[04:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15629.72s)]
*  And the city would also make money, [[04:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15631.72s)]
*  because by cutting out the middleman, [[04:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15632.88s)]
*  the city would be selling a permit for $400 or so. [[04:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15634.8s)]
*  That's new revenue they don't currently get. [[04:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15637.68s)]
*  So... [[04:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15640.039999999999s)]
*  Why is the city limiting the permits? [[04:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15641.6s)]
*  I think it's a mixture of incompetence [[04:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15644.24s)]
*  and lack of interest. [[04:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15645.72s)]
*  It's, there's not a clear reason why you would turn away [[04:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15647.64s)]
*  revenue, safety, cheaper food. [[04:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15650.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15653.72s)]
*  And the street vendor... [[04:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15654.56s)]
*  The permanent structure also creates, you know, [[04:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15655.4s)]
*  you have to go and make sure that the food is safe, right? [[04:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15657.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and... [[04:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15660.24s)]
*  It's the safety aspect of it. [[04:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15661.08s)]
*  And you still have some of these inspections [[04:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15662.28s)]
*  because people are using other people's permits, [[04:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15663.76s)]
*  but ultimately you're creating a fertile ground [[04:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15665.84s)]
*  for middlemen who are not selling any of these things, [[04:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15668.92s)]
*  they're just making bank every single year. [[04:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15671.720000000001s)]
*  And the street vendor project has been doing [[04:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15674.480000000001s)]
*  great work on this. [[04:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15676.84s)]
*  Expensive middleman is the name of the game, I feel like. [[04:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15679.52s)]
*  I know, I know. [[04:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15681.800000000001s)]
*  Improves the GDP. [[04:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15682.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we gotta get rid of these middlemen. [[04:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15684.4s)]
*  Bro. [[04:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15686.92s)]
*  All right. [[04:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXkdrQsHXw&t=15690.36s)]
