# Interview With Astead Herndon On The Collapse Of Trust In The Democratic Party
**HasanAbi:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA)
*  And this, by the way, is the unitary executive committee process that was actually entertained [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=0.0s)]
*  and thought up of far before Donald Trump even. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=7.72s)]
*  When Donald Trump was writing or taking out op-ed or full page New York Times ads talking [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=11.8s)]
*  about how we need to black teenagers in the Central Park Five or whatever, even back then [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=16.76s)]
*  the Republican think tanks were trying to figure out ways of undermining the legislative [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=22.38s)]
*  body and basically making the president. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=27.62s)]
*  Anyway I'm going to talk to a stead Herndon of of the New York Times right now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=35.42s)]
*  I forgot that we were supposed to converse with one another earlier in the day, half [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=42.58s)]
*  an hour ago, but luckily he was able to join the call. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=50.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to talk to him right now about updates from his earlier pieces about how [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=54.7s)]
*  people were reacting to the Trump victory. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=62.92s)]
*  Instead, you hear me? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=66.04s)]
*  Yes, I can. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=68.42s)]
*  Thank you for coming on. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=69.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what's up? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  How are you? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  I'm I'm all as all right as one can be. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=76.5s)]
*  I was listening to you talk about home and some of the other things. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=78.26s)]
*  I think you're right to point out the broader strategy of kind of erasing civil protection. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=82.22s)]
*  I interviewed home in a couple of years ago and he's been planning this for years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=88.46s)]
*  And that's someone who's really serious about the broader effort of not just removing criminal [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=94.02s)]
*  unauthorized immigrants, but basically just changing the scope of the immigration system [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=101.02s)]
*  broadly. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=105.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=106.52s)]
*  It's a it's a dire situation that's ahead of us. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=107.6s)]
*  And I think our dire situation is happening right now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  But I think that actually dovetails nicely into what I wanted to talk about, which is, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=116.56s)]
*  of course, how are people reacting to this? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  Now you have a piece. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=127.0s)]
*  You do this podcast called the run up for the New York Times, where you interview regular [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=128.68s)]
*  Americans to the best of your ability. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=134.82s)]
*  And that's what we were going to talk about today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=138.66s)]
*  Updates on updates on that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=142.06s)]
*  So I'm very excited to have you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=146.02s)]
*  We started calling back some of the people we met last year on the campaign trail as [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=148.46s)]
*  part of a process of bringing the show back. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=152.34s)]
*  The episodes are now yet and we're still going through the process, but we're already starting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=154.7s)]
*  to see some things that really match up with some of the numbers. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=157.9s)]
*  I mean, the biggest thing that came through is there is a sense of of, I think, that of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=161.54s)]
*  surprise of what we were hearing folks express, that they feel like Trump isn't focusing on [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=167.62s)]
*  some of the issues they thought he would. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=171.58s)]
*  I think we were hearing from people particularly upset around tariffs and particularly upset [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=174.26s)]
*  around the role that Elon Musk kind of has, the co-presidency of it all. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=179.02s)]
*  That came up a bunch. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=183.46s)]
*  But the other thing that really came through, and this is not necessarily about Donald Trump, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=185.26s)]
*  is the complete collapse of faith in the Democratic Party. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=188.46s)]
*  Among the undecided voters we talked to already, maybe about 10, 15 of them, even the people [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=192.06s)]
*  who have not liked what Trump has done, still did not regret voting for him. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=197.3s)]
*  And almost all of them said that it wasn't a situation where they thought the Democrats [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=202.18s)]
*  would have been a preferable option. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=208.46s)]
*  And so I definitely think that there's an emerging picture here of Trump as a figure [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=210.34s)]
*  who has a lot of leeway among the electorate to shake shit up, really. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=216.02s)]
*  And I think that kind of premise is one that is actually really held. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=219.9s)]
*  But the things that he has chosen to do that on, I think specifically the economic front [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=223.85999999999999s)]
*  and the risk of increased inflation or chaos driven by these tariffs, have really landed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=227.5s)]
*  as people as like not necessarily what they signed up for. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=232.1s)]
*  But it's kind of different than some of the stuff we expect, honestly. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=235.22s)]
*  There was a lot of leeway for him to focus on illegal immigration. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=238.94s)]
*  I will bring up things like deportations and some of the things we've seen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=242.78s)]
*  And honestly, we saw people largely say they were OK with it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=246.62s)]
*  Now I think it's partially a little different than what you were talking about. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  They don't really have a sense of where this might go in the future. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  But as of right now, because of the focus and the story they've been telling about criminal [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=255.58s)]
*  migrants and focusing on them, that has really latched on with some folks already. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=259.82s)]
*  And so it's not really Ukraine or immigration. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=264.58s)]
*  It was much more so Elon Musk as a person, as a figure, and also tariffs, really. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=266.96s)]
*  And so if we add up the parts of the America First agenda that weren't landing, it might [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=273.64s)]
*  not be what folks expect. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  But it does show a shift in the elector, which I think is part of the reason the White House [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=279.78s)]
*  is a little scared. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=283.76s)]
*  I'm sure you saw today Elise Stefanik pulling back her nomination for the UN ambassador. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=284.76s)]
*  That's 100% because the White House is thinking about that congressional seat. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  And the fact that they have really pissed off a group of people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=293.92s)]
*  And so are Democrats the vessel to seize on that right now? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=297.48s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  But there is an opportunity partially because of the way that this White House has gone [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  about fulfilling that mandate. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=304.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=307.68s)]
*  Elise Stefanik one is interesting. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=308.68s)]
*  Definitely there's a lot of discontent. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=312.76s)]
*  And I think one of the things that is probably too early for you to analyze is the signal [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=314.16s)]
*  group chat situation, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=321.32s)]
*  I think that that has also caused a lot of discontent and a lot of chaos amongst people [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  who might have even been Trump supporters in general. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=330.88s)]
*  That was happening on the day we were really calling people. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=333.84s)]
*  And we heard it come up a couple times, but not necessarily in the Hillary email servers. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=337.64s)]
*  And for sure, we'll see polling and stuff on this as we talk to people more. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=342.44s)]
*  But it was really just amateur hour example. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=346.55999999999995s)]
*  And so people were referencing it as a sign of White House's kind of unseriousness. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, if that turns into something bigger later, I think we'll hear some of that more. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=354.11999999999995s)]
*  But it was really just used as a sign that these are kind of folks who haven't taken [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=358.32s)]
*  the role in the office seriously. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=362.4s)]
*  But people, every time we do these efforts, people really have a sense that they think [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=365.08s)]
*  they know Trump and they think they know him better than everyone else. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=369.52s)]
*  And so oftentimes when you'll bring up something, and I was talking to someone and she was like, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=373.44s)]
*  well, Elon Musk will only be there for less than six months. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=377.84s)]
*  And I was like, how do you know that? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=381.2s)]
*  What's informing you? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=382.64s)]
*  What's what's what's? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  They're like, well, I just don't think Donald Trump will keep him around if he becomes too [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=385.2s)]
*  much of a nuisance. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  Like people tell themselves a story about Trump. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=389.2s)]
*  And so it really insulates him oftentimes from some political consequences, because [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  people just block out the possibility of certain stuff happening. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's like weirdly parasocial. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=401.64s)]
*  I mean, it's cultish in the old terminology to use, but it's very parasocial in the sense [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=405.92s)]
*  that like they have confidence in Trump as the utmost authority. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=410.8s)]
*  So virtually everything he does, it's actually for the greater good. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=415.72s)]
*  And maybe we simply don't understand it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=419.8s)]
*  I think that's always been Trump's weapon, though, because he is a great room reader [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=423.6s)]
*  and he's been able to cultivate such a fan base by one, taking advantage of the weaknesses [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=427.72s)]
*  of the Democratic Party in terms of both messaging and platform, and then also been able to show [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=433.28s)]
*  himself as a strong leader. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=439.68s)]
*  I interviewed two people. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=441.47999999999996s)]
*  I went to the Bernie rally in Nevada. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=443.44s)]
*  I was invited there by their team and I interviewed Bernie and AOC there as well. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=446.88s)]
*  But outside of that, I also talked to two Uber drivers, one that was apolitical, but [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=451.52s)]
*  right wing, and the other that was apolitical, but liberal, one Kamala voter and one Trump [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=460.64s)]
*  voter. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=464.72s)]
*  And I think the Trump voter, basically podcast guy operating on exactly the boundaries that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=465.72s)]
*  you just referenced, talking about all of the irrelevant things that podcasters have [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  told him are very significant and that Trump is like taking serious action against. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=484.24s)]
*  But what I think was really enlightening about the conversation that I had with the Kamala [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  voter was that she was a black woman in Vegas and they were both Tesla drivers. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=499.68s)]
*  But and she was saying that she was she was basically saying like there is no like I didn't [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=500.48s)]
*  like the Democrats either, but I have a feeling of discontent. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=507.44s)]
*  I have an overall overall feeling of unease, so much so that I'm actually planning with [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=512.24s)]
*  my husband to to move out of the country to a more affordable place, talking about [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=517.12s)]
*  potentially moving to Ghana or Thailand. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=524.08s)]
*  Now, you know, this is all tick tock related stuff that they've you know, they've compiled [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=526.4s)]
*  this information randomly. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=531.04s)]
*  But what was what was interesting about it, what was interesting about it was that she [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=532.32s)]
*  basically she was uneasy about Trump's actions, but she brought up the point that at least [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=539.36s)]
*  he is a go getter, if that makes sense. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=548.24s)]
*  And I think that is really important to recognize when we look at the approval ratings of Donald [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=550.96s)]
*  Trump, even if he's doing something that's like inherently chaotic, he's still seen as [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=556.16s)]
*  a guy who is doing anything. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=562.48s)]
*  Whereas it goes back to the overall discontent that people have experienced and the overall [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=564.64s)]
*  lack of interest and trust that they place or faith that they place in the institutions [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=571.36s)]
*  because they haven't served them. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=575.76s)]
*  So they look to Trump as a guy who, you know, they might not agree with his methods, but [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=577.6s)]
*  at least he's doing something as opposed to the Democrats who are doing nothing, the do [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=581.76s)]
*  nothing Democrats. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=585.6s)]
*  And the reason why I brought this up is because of what you just presented as what people [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  are paying attention to, right? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=595.28s)]
*  On either side of the political spectrum, they're paying attention to the silliness, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=598.16s)]
*  they're paying attention to maybe the tariffs, which will have a dire economic circumstance, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=602.8s)]
*  dire economic backlash for the average American, or at least that's how it's being presented [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=607.92s)]
*  in the media overall. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=614.4s)]
*  And they're not necessarily paying attention to the erosion of the First Amendment protections [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=616.4s)]
*  that are currently afforded to citizens and non-citizens alike, and also the Department [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  of Homeland Security deportation processes that are grabbing random people. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=626.64s)]
*  Now, I think tariffs are still important. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=631.3599999999999s)]
*  I think Elon Musk undermining the administrative body is very important. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  Having said that, what they're doing on the other side that people are not paying attention [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  to will have far more dire consequences in the long run, I think, or at least they work [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=645.76s)]
*  hand in hand with one another. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=650.24s)]
*  The reason why they're not focusing on it, however, still goes back to the Democrats, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  because I think that there is a real crisis of leadership in the Democratic Party reflected [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=656.64s)]
*  by the attitude that these people you interviewed are demonstrating. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=660.32s)]
*  But it's also because they are not directing their anger and resentment or directing the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=664.1600000000001s)]
*  anger and resentment of the overall population to these issues, to these severe violations [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=669.84s)]
*  of the constitutional protections. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=675.52s)]
*  And they're dropping the ball in a spectacular fashion, because I think if more people were [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=678.4s)]
*  aware of these actions, the media would cover it more. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=684.4s)]
*  If the Democrats made a big fuss about these sorts of things, as they have done about the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=687.36s)]
*  tariffs, as they have done about Elon Musk individually ruining the federal government, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=691.36s)]
*  more people would be very, very worried, and they should be very worried. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=699.6s)]
*  So I think both... [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=704.32s)]
*  I actually think what you're laying out here is a huge point. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=706.32s)]
*  The things that people focus on from the administration are not necessarily the things [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=711.2s)]
*  that are part of the broader project of executive power that is the goal of this administration. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=715.36s)]
*  When we talk about Project 2025, it's not just a random list of things. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=721.2s)]
*  It is a cohesive view of how conservatives want to reshape executive authority in the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=725.2800000000001s)]
*  federal government. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=731.12s)]
*  And so sometimes it's very hard for me when I'm talking to folks, because I know that. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  I know those things. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=736.24s)]
*  I've been in those conservative spaces. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=737.2s)]
*  And sometimes you will hear parts of the Republican Party articulate that vision. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  For a lot of those Republicans, they take a lot of pride in the fact that they have [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=744.4000000000001s)]
*  reshaped their party from being the George Bush, chamber of commerce style to this sort [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=748.08s)]
*  of version of Republicans. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=753.04s)]
*  But that's not necessarily what people ingest from Donald Trump. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=755.12s)]
*  And so you'll hear the silliness come up all the time. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=758.8s)]
*  Golf of Mexico, America, Canada, 51st state, Greenland type of stuff. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=761.28s)]
*  But you're not hearing the necessary... [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=766.56s)]
*  Or even... [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  I think Doge is actually a great example of this, because people's focus is on Elon Musk [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=768.88s)]
*  as a person and kind of the chaos generally. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  One of the things we tried to do in a video I did for The Times a couple of weeks ago [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  was Doge is an effort that they are picking intentional legal fights, because they have [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=779.84s)]
*  sat around and thought about ways that they want the president to have power to shape [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=784.72s)]
*  over those agencies. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=789.12s)]
*  They have rewritten executive orders for the purposes of the legal fights to come. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=790.64s)]
*  And so these are all intentional battles that they're picking. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=795.52s)]
*  And I think that that part gets really lost in the mud. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=799.6s)]
*  And I somewhat think it's certainly a media challenge. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=803.2800000000001s)]
*  I would say Democrats also, but I really think like sometimes we talk over [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  the Trump project. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=809.68s)]
*  And if it's just like an individual caught following this individual crazy guy, I think [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  you miss the broader point. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=817.3599999999999s)]
*  Because a big difference, I think, between him this time versus last time is the way [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=819.3599999999999s)]
*  in which he has brought a movement along with him that has a specific vision. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=823.92s)]
*  And so this time around is much more about exactly that and reshaping... [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=828.7199999999999s)]
*  I always go back to kind of executive authority, but you're right about deportations, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=834.16s)]
*  about free speech rights. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=838.48s)]
*  I think they're intentionally going to pick some fights with media about press freedom. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=839.76s)]
*  They're going to... [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=844.32s)]
*  There are goals that they have that are just inevitable over the next several years. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=845.36s)]
*  And the other thing I think is important to say is like one time I ran this past a couple [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=850.64s)]
*  Trump people being like, there's some real risk of backlash here, right? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=854.64s)]
*  Tariffs are largely unpopular, like that type of stuff. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=860.0s)]
*  And they really just aren't calibrating themselves for kind of political midpoint. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=863.44s)]
*  I think there is a sense that they have already experienced what it is when the government [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=870.0s)]
*  has all pointed fingers at them or what happens when they lose the House in the midterms. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=874.48s)]
*  And they're kind of trying to make it such. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=878.72s)]
*  They're trying to change presidential authority such. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  So even if they lose some House seats, Congress is just generally more irrelevant. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=882.48s)]
*  So the goal of the next year and a half, the goal of the next couple years is about [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=887.36s)]
*  power in general and about the reshaping of government and culture that I think they [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=892.0s)]
*  really don't even care what the political backlash is to that because I think that goal [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=898.0s)]
*  is bigger than that. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=903.36s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=904.4s)]
*  And this, by the way, is the unitary executive committee process that was actually entertained [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=905.2s)]
*  and thought up of far before Donald Trump even. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=912.8s)]
*  When Donald Trump was writing or taking out Op-Ed or full page New York Times ads talking [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=916.64s)]
*  about how we need to ****** black teenagers in the Central Park Five or whatever, that [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=921.84s)]
*  even back then the Republican think tanks were trying to figure out ways of undermining [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  the legislative body and basically making the president a monarch. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=932.0s)]
*  So this extension, maybe a logical conclusion of that, it's just Trump is the vehicle that [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=936.48s)]
*  will deliver this change to the American Constitution, it seems, or maybe someone that [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=943.76s)]
*  comes after. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=949.44s)]
*  And the first time he wasn't necessarily fit for that because they were so surprised he [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  won the primary and they were so surprised he won the race that it was just a reaction. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=955.84s)]
*  Now, as he's been the unquestioned leader of Republican Party, him and the kind of heritage [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=959.9200000000001s)]
*  view that's been plotting this correctly to point out since Reagan have really linked [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=964.4000000000001s)]
*  up to merge their goals. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=969.84s)]
*  So I really think that Trump experiencing those charges and his retribution view allowed [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=974.1600000000001s)]
*  him to be a much better vessel for that kind of unitary executive theory because for him [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=980.88s)]
*  it now works in terms of power and exacting revenge from a set of enemies he thinks targeted [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=986.64s)]
*  him while he was out of office. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=992.4000000000001s)]
*  But it really is a part of a longer project. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=993.76s)]
*  And so it's hard even right now when people ask, or even I think there's a lot of Democrats [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=996.96s)]
*  who are saying, how do we get this energy channel? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1002.96s)]
*  What should we do? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1005.6800000000001s)]
*  What's the electoral response to Trumpism right now? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1007.36s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't, I know that there's certainly, I think public pushback matters [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1010.24s)]
*  and I think we've seen that in certain instances, but what their bigger project is, is to really [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1014.4000000000001s)]
*  insulate themselves from public reaction. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  And to insulate themselves, insulate their policy goals from being responsive to that. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1022.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1028.32s)]
*  And that's why I try to stress, like talking to Bernie, talking to AOC, what I'm trying [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1030.96s)]
*  to get them on board with is like, my position, for example, on Israel and Palestine is obviously [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  significantly different than the overwhelming majority, if not the entirety of Congress, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1044.96s)]
*  including, but not limited to the likes of Bernie Sanders and AOC. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1050.0s)]
*  Having said that, the issue of going after student protesters and student activists without any sort [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  of serious, without any sort of evidence whatsoever of like any sort of wrongdoing is not being done [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1064.24s)]
*  because these guys are truly terrified of, I think, students doing protests against Israel. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1072.32s)]
*  Like that's a secondary reason. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1080.3999999999999s)]
*  The primary reason why they're using this issue is because they can use anti-Semitism [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1082.72s)]
*  and also pro-Israeli groups that play a formative role in the lobbying efforts against [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1089.3600000000001s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans alike to undermine constitutional protections for documented, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1097.6000000000001s)]
*  undocumented citizens and non-citizens alike with the ultimate goal of eroding due process [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1105.04s)]
*  protections and eroding, you know, search and seizure protections and last but not least, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1112.32s)]
*  eroding free speech protections. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1119.28s)]
*  And I'm really worried that a lot of Americans are completely oblivious to this because they [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1123.12s)]
*  either don't care or because like the Democrats themselves seemingly don't care enough about this [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1131.28s)]
*  stuff. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1138.24s)]
*  I think you're right that a lot of folks aren't focused on this. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1138.8s)]
*  There's a really tough part even about the cycles that I live in in my job because the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1141.12s)]
*  year after an election, you feel the electorate step back from politics mostly. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1145.04s)]
*  And so a lot of the things even we're doing now is partly because I want to keep a tighter [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1150.4799999999998s)]
*  check-in with some of these voters to see what is even cutting through to them and what isn't. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1156.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's sometimes, you know, to your point, it's very rarely going to be that kind of larger [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1160.6399999999999s)]
*  articulation of political power unless media does a little bit of a better job putting those [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1166.32s)]
*  pieces together. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1170.96s)]
*  And I think politicians can use a bully pulpit to focus their efforts on that too. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1172.0s)]
*  But, you know, when you mention kind of, you know, even Palestine or other things, I mean, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1176.4s)]
*  I think that there has just not been an acknowledgement that Democrats are on the wrong [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1181.44s)]
*  public opinion side on some of this stuff. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1185.44s)]
*  And it comes up in these talks, right? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1188.48s)]
*  Like when we ask people about the moments where their faith collapsed in the Democratic Party, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1191.04s)]
*  people bring up immigration. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1196.32s)]
*  People feel like the Biden administration did not listen to an inflation and immigration crisis [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1197.6s)]
*  kind of in 2021, 2022. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1202.1599999999999s)]
*  People bring up Palestine, that they feel like the party represented a status quo in terms of [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1204.8799999999999s)]
*  specifically supporting foreign governments or feeling like, you know, we're supporting [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1211.76s)]
*  slaughtering over there. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1217.6799999999998s)]
*  And then people also, I think, and this has been a new one, honestly, every single person we talk [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1219.36s)]
*  to mention trans women in sports. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1225.36s)]
*  And I don't actually think that was that big of a deal six to eight months ago. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1227.84s)]
*  But it has clearly become a thing that folks have latched onto about ways to show the Democratic [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1234.4799999999998s)]
*  Party is out of touch. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1240.24s)]
*  And so even when we talk about a couple of issues where they're just legitimately, I think, kind of [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1241.76s)]
*  flagrantly on the wrong side of public opinion, those become stand-ins for people to say this is [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1246.9599999999998s)]
*  just politics as usual, and they're the kind of like Democrats of the same, they're just [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1252.96s)]
*  swapping out faces on the same thing we already know. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1257.92s)]
*  And those are the times they have really brought that up. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1260.48s)]
*  But I honestly got to think on a couple of these things. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1262.8s)]
*  They're, I don't think Republicans are wrong to say that Democrats are on the wrong side of a [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1266.48s)]
*  70-30 issue when it comes to trans women in sports. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1271.44s)]
*  Now, they could talk to the public about why and try to shift that public opinion, right? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1274.16s)]
*  You can leave. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1279.2s)]
*  Like your other option here, if you're not going to change your opinion, is to leave. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1280.08s)]
*  And to tell a story about why this matters and about what's important. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  So that's your other option. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1286.48s)]
*  But they're not doing that, really. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1287.68s)]
*  They're kind of sticking their heads in the sand. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1289.2800000000002s)]
*  And as they've done that, the Republican Party and specifically this last Trump campaign has [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1291.1200000000001s)]
*  defined them around kind of, you know, that the ad they spent the most money on, you know, the [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1295.1200000000001s)]
*  she's for they, them, not for you. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1300.48s)]
*  It worked. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1302.64s)]
*  And so I would say like a big difference in even my interactions with people is they bring that up [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1303.6000000000001s)]
*  every single time. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1309.7600000000002s)]
*  And that was not true last year. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1311.12s)]
*  So that's a really interesting point. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1313.04s)]
*  And I think it goes back to the same thing that you and I have talked about time and time again, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1315.12s)]
*  which is that and it's something that I brought forward to the Podjons when I had a conversation [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1319.68s)]
*  on Pod Save America as well, both before the election and after the election, which is that [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1325.12s)]
*  if you are undefinable by policies and if you're constantly focus group testing and you're letting [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1329.44s)]
*  the Republicans dominate the messaging landscape, then yeah, you're undefinable and your enemies [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1334.56s)]
*  the Republicans will be able to define you to whatever position that they want to define you [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1341.2s)]
*  by. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1347.2s)]
*  And that is incredibly successful and is yet another example of complete capitulation to [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1348.08s)]
*  the Republicans being super damaging to the Democratic Party. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1356.08s)]
*  They got crushed on the messaging front because they were policy lists. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1360.8s)]
*  If there is this is twofold. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1365.2s)]
*  The problem is twofold. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1367.2s)]
*  One, there's no counter messaging. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1368.1599999999999s)]
*  Two, there's no definable policy that you can attribute to the Democrats that are going to [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1369.6s)]
*  tangibly improve people's material realities. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1374.24s)]
*  If the Democrats could be like Bernie Sanders associated with a couple key issues, then it [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1377.84s)]
*  would be virtually impossible to say no, this is what they stand for. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1384.24s)]
*  But because the Democrats don't stand for anything and I mean, look, we follow politics fairly [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1389.9199999999998s)]
*  closely. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1396.56s)]
*  I would say a lot closer than the average American citizen. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1396.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1400.1599999999999s)]
*  And, and I can't tell you what the Democrats stand for. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1400.8s)]
*  Can you? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1406.24s)]
*  They stand for Donald Trump is bad. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1408.72s)]
*  They stand for institutions are good. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1410.3999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1413.44s)]
*  I think it's like, I think to me it's like a vague like defense of institutions, but to [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  your point, and I think, you know, Ezra Klein and a couple others have been talking more about [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1420.8s)]
*  this, but like there needs to be a language of improving institutions that Democrats were not [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1425.04s)]
*  engaging in because they were defending these things that people weren't invested in. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1429.68s)]
*  And I'm glad that you brought up Bernie because he's really someone who I think when you're out [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1433.68s)]
*  in the world and I have as I've covered both of his presidential runs, it's a helpful person to [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1438.1599999999999s)]
*  use when you think about the Democratic Party's future because the type of people you meet who [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1444.1599999999999s)]
*  are Bernie supporters in places like Iowa or, or others are never the type that you basically see [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1448.4s)]
*  online. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1455.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1456.0s)]
*  Like they wouldn't even define themselves as progressives. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1456.3200000000002s)]
*  They don't even think in an ideological lens, but they do understand is they think there's too [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1459.52s)]
*  much money in politics. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1463.8400000000001s)]
*  They think that like, they think the establishment has not like, helps change come about. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1465.2s)]
*  And so the things that he's associated with are what is, are what is actually allowing that [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1471.6000000000001s)]
*  authenticity to come through, but they're not really thinking in the left, right, left center [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1476.56s)]
*  binary. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1482.8799999999999s)]
*  And so I always am telling people, like I would meet people on the trail. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1483.76s)]
*  I remember this particularly in the 2020 primary who were torn between Bernie and Michael Bloomberg. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1493.28s)]
*  And they would think in our like, in our ideological brain, those are at odds, but that's, but it [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1493.76s)]
*  wasn't because it was two people who they felt like they understood what they believed in and [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  they had the trust in that. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1502.08s)]
*  I feel like when we talk about Democrats going forward, there's way too much focus on the [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1503.4399999999998s)]
*  individual policy position, like center, mid and left. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1508.8s)]
*  And I sometimes think that's driven by a centrist pundits and sometimes media who just want to [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1512.4799999999998s)]
*  punch at left. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1518.56s)]
*  I'm like, the real thing I feel like I experienced is a lack of authenticity and the lack of like [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1519.76s)]
*  trust with voters. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1525.1999999999998s)]
*  That's not really driven by the calibration of ideology. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1526.1599999999999s)]
*  It's about how you're communicating to them and the fact that you really aren't playing in the [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1530.24s)]
*  things that people most care about. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1534.1599999999999s)]
*  Like a good example is like, I hear about term limits all the time. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1535.52s)]
*  I hear about people wanting to hear things about homelessness or how to fix, you know, like [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1539.12s)]
*  education comes up all the time, right? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1544.0s)]
*  Like there are things in which happen on the ground level that like people just don't even [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1545.84s)]
*  play in on the politics level. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1551.12s)]
*  And so I'm like, recalibrating that feels like much more of a useful exercise for the party [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1552.8s)]
*  over the next couple of years to me in fighting over how to best perform Trump opposition at [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1558.8s)]
*  the state of the union. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1564.6399999999999s)]
*  Like I'm like, your problem is not whether you hold cards or not. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1565.6s)]
*  And actually in that one, I understand AOC not showing up at all. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1568.24s)]
*  I understand Al Green showing up and yelling at him. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1572.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't understand what they were doing in the middle. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1575.12s)]
*  And so I'm like, that to me is always- [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1577.76s)]
*  Or even coming after Al Green, which was insane. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1579.52s)]
*  Some Democrats actually criticize them as well for his actions. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1584.1599999999999s)]
*  So like it blew my mind because what you're describing about key issues that people have [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1587.6s)]
*  anger around right now are also come up with because of their individual experiences. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1595.12s)]
*  They're not even being directed to be angry towards those sorts of things, right? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1601.04s)]
*  This is without the Democratic Party leading them to get mad about specific issues like this. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1605.28s)]
*  So that's like free ball. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1610.3999999999999s)]
*  That's free game for them to just pick up. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1611.9199999999998s)]
*  So that's incompetence on a different level. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1614.8799999999999s)]
*  My argument always is obviously under the existing duopoly, the counterbalance to the [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1617.84s)]
*  Republican messaging has to come from the Democrats that actually whip up support for [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1625.12s)]
*  certain issues in the same way that the Republicans have because it's not like the Republican Party [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1629.9199999999998s)]
*  has ever cared about an issue being really unpopular. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1637.76s)]
*  I mean, look, they- no matter which way they can, they get that across for their most loyal [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1641.52s)]
*  fans for the tapped in 30% evangelical white Christian base. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1647.44s)]
*  They will deliver something that is unimaginably unpopular. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1652.8s)]
*  The abortion rights being taken away, women's bodily autonomy being taken away. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1658.16s)]
*  Democrats would never demonstrate political courage of that sort. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1663.52s)]
*  That's like not even- that's not even a question. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1667.92s)]
*  And I think that they need to do that significantly more frequently [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1671.1200000000001s)]
*  and be associated with key policies and constantly talk about how good they are. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1676.32s)]
*  Because if they don't do that, then the space is flooded by Republicans simply lying to create [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1681.76s)]
*  just cause for the immigration enforcement actions that they're taking place or misdirecting [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1687.6799999999998s)]
*  people's attentions back to like the 49 trans athletes that were participating in NCAA [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1694.24s)]
*  competitions. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1701.6s)]
*  Donald Trump signing an executive order surrounded by female athletes and making a big show of force [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1702.64s)]
*  is nothing but simple misdirection. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1710.0s)]
*  If I were to remove the morality of transphobia versus protecting trans people, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1712.5600000000002s)]
*  it is ironically no different than what the Democrats are being branded as. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1718.48s)]
*  Silly people that only care about 0.1% of the population. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1724.5600000000002s)]
*  Now obviously I'm saying I'm removing the morality because I think it is immoral to [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1729.84s)]
*  violate the civil liberties of trans people. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1736.48s)]
*  But ultimately it still plays the role of a distraction. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1740.56s)]
*  When you focus on that, you think, oh, this person is doing something for me because I've [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1744.56s)]
*  heard over and over again that this is a major problem. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1749.4399999999998s)]
*  And now I agree that this is a major problem because no one told me this is not a major [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1752.24s)]
*  problem at all. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1756.6399999999999s)]
*  And the people that are ostensibly on the side of trans people are not doing anything [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1757.6s)]
*  for me at all. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1761.9199999999998s)]
*  And even on the policy front, they're not doing anything for trans people. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1763.4399999999998s)]
*  They're just aesthetically claiming that they care about trans people without actually [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1767.9199999999998s)]
*  ever doing any sort of serious protections for them. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1772.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1775.4399999999998s)]
*  The other option is to stand up. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1776.3999999999999s)]
*  The other option is to do something. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1778.6399999999999s)]
*  And so I'm like, when that's not taken, it makes no sense to me. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1780.7199999999998s)]
*  But you're really right to point out the differences in where each party starts. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1783.12s)]
*  Republicans force their moderates to basically come along with it or they will get rid of [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1786.96s)]
*  them, whereas the Democrats work from the opposite premise. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1792.8s)]
*  And I think it's also been different because Republicans have had much a bigger culture, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1796.0s)]
*  particularly under Donald Trump, of fueling primary challenges, of ridding congressional [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1800.24s)]
*  members who do not follow the agenda. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1804.8s)]
*  All I heard at Trump rallies over the last two, three years was not even anger at Democrats, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1807.44s)]
*  was an anger that they felt Republicans stymied his first term. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1812.56s)]
*  And so when they were coming back for a second term, they were going to put pressure on [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1816.16s)]
*  Republicans to follow through on the agenda. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1819.3600000000001s)]
*  That's not how Democrats talk. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1822.24s)]
*  And so there is definitely a difference in terms of the political project of both of those sides. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1824.64s)]
*  But I think it's really a macro loss for Democrats. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1830.48s)]
*  This, you know, 2040 didn't just lose the election. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1835.0400000000002s)]
*  Their theory of the case has collapsed. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1836.96s)]
*  The establishment theory of the case over the last eight years, since I think Obama [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1839.76s)]
*  has really rested on a coalition of basically like identity politics that they felt could [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1844.56s)]
*  overwhelm everything else. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1852.8s)]
*  That if the other side was regressive on a kind of cultural front, then they could hold their [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1854.0s)]
*  side together and that that diversity, you know, diversity is their strength also overlaps with [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1859.36s)]
*  like a kind of demographic destiny argument. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1864.32s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1867.44s)]
*  And so all of the things, it's just not true, right? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1868.3999999999999s)]
*  It's woke racism. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1871.04s)]
*  It literally is like, oh, these Mexican, these stupid Mexicans will vote for us. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1872.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1876.0s)]
*  We talked about this time, but this is a flattening of all those identities. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1877.1200000000001s)]
*  And so what they have on their hands is a legitimate challenge where they need to find [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1880.5600000000002s)]
*  something that cuts through. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1885.2s)]
*  But when we talk about homelessness or education or things, they usually, in my opinion, avoid [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1886.48s)]
*  the issues that would make rich folks mad. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1892.3200000000002s)]
*  And that is going to be a problem for them if they're also because those are also the issues [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1895.2800000000002s)]
*  that combine the types of people they're losing. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1900.88s)]
*  And so I really think right now they have a couple problems on their hands. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1903.2800000000002s)]
*  They lost the stands after the election. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1906.88s)]
*  They lost people who are deeply invested in the party because they felt as if they haven't [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1908.72s)]
*  stood up for them. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1912.88s)]
*  But they can fix that, I think, over the next year or so or going into the midterms. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1913.7600000000002s)]
*  There's a base problem that I think is much more about malaise, is much more about lack of vision, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1917.68s)]
*  to your point, and is much more, I think, about a misalignment between the people who they take [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1922.64s)]
*  their incentives from, whether it be media or donors or who are that, and the disconnects [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1926.96s)]
*  among their base. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1932.24s)]
*  And so one of the reasons I think they overindexed on identity, on representation, is because [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1933.3600000000001s)]
*  frankly, that is a language that works for a certain class of people who benefited from that. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1938.8s)]
*  But that was never the language on the bottom. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1943.1200000000001s)]
*  I was at George Floyd's memorial, right? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1945.44s)]
*  They were not talking in that type of stuff, right? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1947.2s)]
*  But it was something that benefited certain groups of people. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1950.0s)]
*  So they have a... [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1952.4s)]
*  I really think they have a soul search that's going to take a little bit because if they want [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1953.3600000000001s)]
*  to touch education or homelessness or tech or AI, they might have to make somebody mad. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1958.4s)]
*  They might have to stand for something. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1965.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1966.64s)]
*  And I don't know how many of them want to. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1966.96s)]
*  Yeah. So there in lies also a structural hurdle for the current Democratic Party. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1969.68s)]
*  The base being misaligned and their interests not being represented by the Democrats is, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1976.56s)]
*  to a certain degree, intentional. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1985.44s)]
*  I'm not saying that they're controlled opposition, even though they kind of functionally are [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1986.88s)]
*  considering that they serve the same corporate interests as the Republicans do. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1991.2s)]
*  But the structural hurdle in terms of what you just mentioned with Republicans saying, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=1995.68s)]
*  we're going to primary people who are anti-Trump, is that Trump at the end of the day, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2001.04s)]
*  regardless of the tariff stuff, is consolidating power, but not disrupting the pre-existing [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2007.3600000000001s)]
*  hierarchy where corporations are going to get massive tax breaks, right? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2016.0s)]
*  So corporate bottom lines, corporate profit is still the number one thing that Trump wants to do. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2020.32s)]
*  There might be a different vision of how to get there. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2026.56s)]
*  There might be a different method of how to get there. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2028.56s)]
*  But ultimately, he's still very much in support of the stock market always going up and corporations [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2030.8s)]
*  having record high profits year over year. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2036.6399999999999s)]
*  And the issue is the Democrats also want that. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2039.6s)]
*  And they can't shake themselves out of that, out of the 49-51% dynamic between corporate power, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2046.3999999999999s)]
*  where it's like, okay, we have our woke billionaires and they have their reactionary [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2053.68s)]
*  billionaires. And when push comes to shove, it's obvious that the reactionary billionaires [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2058.16s)]
*  would much rather give in to the guy that's going to hand them the keys of the castle in the way [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2062.72s)]
*  that Donald Trump has. So seeing Hakeem Jeffries run to Silicon Valley to assure, to give assurances [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2069.44s)]
*  to the remaining Silicon Valley tech CEOs that we will give you also unfettered access was [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2077.68s)]
*  truly terrifying about the vision that the party has for its own future. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2084.4s)]
*  Because yes, I think that they have to drop this thing and go full tilt left populist messaging. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2090.64s)]
*  And that is going to cause a little bit of fissures within the party as it exists. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2101.12s)]
*  But there is no other way out of this. Because if they don't do that, then it's over. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2106.56s)]
*  The party's over, democracy, or what remains of the theoretical democracy is over. And it's just [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2111.84s)]
*  all Republican authoritarian control all the way down from here on out. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2118.48s)]
*  At the time, if Democrats get to the time where they can sort this out, which will be 2027, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2122.88s)]
*  the country will be fundamentally changed, in my opinion. I think that we will be in a different [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2128.7200000000003s)]
*  place. I think our political system will look differently. I think that what I believe in this [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2134.0s)]
*  administration, I believe their seriousness. I believe their willingness to test every end [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2138.48s)]
*  and push past it. And I think we are only in the first stages of that. And so the midterms do not [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2143.76s)]
*  solve this. One thing I have learned in going through this a couple of times, a disjointed [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2149.52s)]
*  Democratic party can still have a good midterm elections. Midterms are usually individual races [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2155.84s)]
*  that are vessels about dissatisfaction and do not have to deal with a broader vision. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2161.36s)]
*  Or special elections, even worse than the midterms. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2165.6s)]
*  Or special elections. They have a hyper-engaged group of people. There was a reason why Democrats [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2168.16s)]
*  were doing good in special elections under Biden, even though that was not translating to top of [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2171.04s)]
*  the ticket. So there's a lot of ways they can make individual inroads over the next couple of years. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2175.04s)]
*  But what you're laying out, and I think I'm laying out what I think is their core problem, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2180.3199999999997s)]
*  is a vision question, is a alignment question, is an authenticity question. I think they simply [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2183.92s)]
*  have the type of messengers who aren't used to being truthful, to be real. I don't think they're [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2189.92s)]
*  used to really answering and standing on what they believe in. And so as someone who has been [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2194.8s)]
*  going at these, going and asking about what is the core here? Why is things are the way they are? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2200.32s)]
*  I remember doing this with Harris, really trying to figure out what is the vision that tells you [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2206.5600000000004s)]
*  why problems are the way they are and what you would do to fix them. We did this at the DNC. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2212.5600000000004s)]
*  We were like, what is the difference between a Kamala Harris-led party and a Joe Biden party? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2218.2400000000002s)]
*  Is it substantive? And those answers really couldn't come back. I actually would say, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2222.4s)]
*  to go back to the Gaza-Palestine point, at that time, they were showing more openness to having [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2226.48s)]
*  a different type of message or policy on that front. And that was part of the reason that I [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2231.92s)]
*  do think there was that good vibe. And so I think as those things start to shift, and she sounds [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2237.12s)]
*  more and more like the current administration, is as that stuff dissipates. But there are litmus [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2241.6s)]
*  tests that people have about ways to show you're different than politics as usual. And so one thing [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2246.4s)]
*  is fundamental that what Donald Trump has done is introduced a different version of how politics [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2252.8s)]
*  can look. And so a lot of people have wanted that for a long time, even if you don't like what he's [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2258.56s)]
*  doing. No, he's flashed his FDR, like 100%. Come in 2027, there is going to be a Democrat who [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2263.6000000000004s)]
*  tries to take that ethos and does something different with it. And I think that version [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2270.96s)]
*  is probably the one that wins out. Because I feel as if there is a palpable energy on the ground to [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2275.6s)]
*  rethink what liberalism is. I think there is a sense of failure from the party that's really [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2283.92s)]
*  pervasive. And we felt that last year is part of the reason Donald Trump won in the first place. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2290.3199999999997s)]
*  The sense of what has happened. Democrats telling us we did not send our best in 2024, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2295.6s)]
*  we're dealing with that, they kind of feel like they led Donald Trump back to the White House more [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2302.32s)]
*  so than he wanted. That's what's driving this. And so I just don't think that goes away, even if [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2306.4s)]
*  they went back the house by a couple seats in a year. Yeah, I do fear that they will learn no [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2313.28s)]
*  lessons and keep doing business as usual, and consistently try to- What I'm saying is that [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2318.88s)]
*  they might actually just keep do the same thing. But I think it's going to happen. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2324.4s)]
*  an outsider is going to push them in two years. So the sentiment doesn't actually require an [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2328.4s)]
*  establishment seizing and understanding it. It just requires some type of figure emerging. And [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2334.56s)]
*  all I'm saying is like, the ground is really ripe for that. Yeah. No, I think that's precisely what [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2339.92s)]
*  Bernie is trying to do right now. Because look, independent, democratic, socialist, whatever, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2348.48s)]
*  doesn't matter. He still is a party man. He has caucus with the Democrats in perpetuity for the [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2355.52s)]
*  800 years that he's been in Senate and the 900 years that he's been alive. He's a particular [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2363.2s)]
*  party man under Joe Biden. He really likes Joe Biden, but was a fairly deferential party member [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2367.2s)]
*  for Joe Biden. It's not like he's caucuses with Democrats, but specifically with Joe Biden's [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2373.04s)]
*  Democratic Party, he was a pretty loyal party member. Yeah. And I think that that was his- [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2377.92s)]
*  inevitably, that's where I, as someone who has a lot of respect for Bernie Sanders, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2386.32s)]
*  on that issue specifically, I find myself at odds with him because I think he still believes that [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2391.44s)]
*  if he does all of these rallies, if he does- and tens of thousands of people show up all around [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2397.92s)]
*  the country to these struggle sessions where everyone is talking about their issues and whatnot, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2404.8s)]
*  that the Democrats will look to that and go, oh, we got to do that too. I think that that is [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2410.4s)]
*  ultimately short-sighted in terms of- if it's not- if all of that energy and all that momentum, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2416.32s)]
*  I think, is not directly being funneled into issues that are currently undermining the [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2423.92s)]
*  American future, the preservation of the constitution. Things that Americans, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2430.7999999999997s)]
*  if you ask them directly, would say they care about, certainly, but currently they're not aware of. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2436.7999999999997s)]
*  If they don't actually move all of this organization, all these people that are [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2443.68s)]
*  getting agitated and supporting Bernie Sanders in that direction, I think it's going to- it's [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2450.8799999999997s)]
*  going to be for nothing. That's what I'm afraid of. That's what I worry about. Or spontaneously, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2456.96s)]
*  we're just going to have people running for office that are those leaders that you're talking about. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2463.04s)]
*  I don't want to leave it up to chance. I thought three years ago that somebody would recognize [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2468.8s)]
*  that America thought Biden was way too old to say it was second term. I was like, don't we all know [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2473.68s)]
*  this? I'm not necessarily believing that they're going to step up in some moment, but I guess I'm [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2477.92s)]
*  saying is I think that right now, this is also a different community for Bernie than traditionally. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2482.96s)]
*  I think these are loyal Democrats who are looking for someone and who have come to him. Some of [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2489.12s)]
*  these people who I even have seen at these things were people who were pretty skeptical of him in [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2494.16s)]
*  his original presidential party. These are people who are capital D partisan Democrats who are [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2498.16s)]
*  looking for a channel in frustration. If I am a regular Democrat in Congress, that's the lesson [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2503.68s)]
*  I would take from that was the Bernie's level of authentic messaging is actually really appreciated [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2508.72s)]
*  by a lot of questions of that base. I think that's a different group of people than the [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2513.6s)]
*  people who are basically ingesting Trump from afar. Yeah. No, that Bernie wins the primary. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2517.9199999999996s)]
*  Those are the primary voters. Those are the capital D Democrats. It's actually interesting to me that [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2523.52s)]
*  in this moment, he's gotten those people back because those are the people who I will never [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2528.48s)]
*  forget in the kind of, I was covering Warren in 2020 and so many of her voters end up going to [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2533.28s)]
*  Biden and not to Bernie. A lot of that was really about partisan identity. It was about [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2539.76s)]
*  before they were progressive or left or whatever that they were really Democrats. That was their [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2548.32s)]
*  real comfort with Biden. It was a traditional party politics. Bernie has done himself [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2555.28s)]
*  good in this moment by speaking to that sentiment. It's going to require someone who can get those, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2563.2s)]
*  who can speak in that language that brings, I call them the stands back, but also bring back the [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2568.8799999999997s)]
*  people who have stepped away who are not, who I think it's much more about vision than the kind of [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2574.16s)]
*  expression of anger. Yeah, no, this is like the most, in the most basic terms, this is exactly [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2581.2s)]
*  what I saw from the Pod Save America audience that were shocked at what I was saying because [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2585.68s)]
*  they were like, I agree with everything this guy is saying. How have I never heard this from CNN, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2590.48s)]
*  MSNBC, or even Pod Save America? And what I simply was telling them is like, I want a fighter. I [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2594.64s)]
*  hate the Republicans and the Democrats don't sufficiently hate the Republicans. They want to [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2601.52s)]
*  be Republicans. I think that's despicable. It's the proximity to the Republicans in terms of attitude, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2605.92s)]
*  policy, and politics. Well, not politics, but policy that frustrates me. And I think there are [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2612.8s)]
*  a lot of people that want that. A lot of people want Democrats to actually fight. And hopefully- [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2619.28s)]
*  I mean, they've really latched themselves on to the kind of Lincoln Project lane. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2626.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2631.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't really know what happens there, to be honest. Like, that's the kind of relationship [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2632.1000000000004s)]
*  that's become codependent. But if I'm the Democratic Party, I don't know what return I've [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2636.7200000000003s)]
*  really gotten on that relationship. Not a huge one, in my opinion. And this election was, I mean, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2641.0400000000004s)]
*  I think they drive the kind of like most engaged people, whatever. But if the premise was that you [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2647.2s)]
*  were going to win over a sufficient amount of like traditional Republicans or institutionalists, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2651.7599999999998s)]
*  that was what 2024's entire premise was. Yeah. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2657.52s)]
*  From Biden, Harris, Democratic establishment, was that the kind of coalition of the normal, right? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2660.08s)]
*  I'm like, they have not proven to be- I mean, at minimum, they're not the vessels to reach those [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2666.3199999999997s)]
*  people, right? So I'm like, I really don't understand where that type of relationship goes. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2671.92s)]
*  But their kind of codependence is really important, I think, because it's, I think, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2678.08s)]
*  really encouraged Democrats to keep leftist kind of populist politics at a distance, right? They [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2682.64s)]
*  were making an alliance on another sort. And so those are the type of relationships that I think [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2688.64s)]
*  are going to be very interesting going forward. It's because I do think they've got into this [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2693.76s)]
*  kind of unholy alliance with all of these Trump fleeing Republicans, but it hasn't necessarily- [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2699.68s)]
*  and bringing themselves closer to them, they've gotten themselves, I think, a little further from [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2706.3199999999997s)]
*  their base, or at least are not asking them the type of questions that are going to get them [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2710.24s)]
*  closer. But what they do on that front is part of my interest over the next several years. But to [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2713.44s)]
*  your point, like there's not like a leader doing that, right? There's not like a- there's not a [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2717.9199999999996s)]
*  place for that to happen right now. And so that's why it's so kind of chaotic, choose your fighter, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2722.16s)]
*  is because there's not a centralized, you know, person or vision or think tank or something [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2728.64s)]
*  they're working from. I had to meet a couple of weeks ago, where's the liberal project 2025, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2734.56s)]
*  right? I'm like, where is, where is actually the version of the heritage foundation for Democrats? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2738.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm like, is that abundance? Is that Ezra there? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2744.4s)]
*  I was just about to say, I didn't know, you know, that's your boy, all right. But I was [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2747.68s)]
*  going to bring that up. That was going to be my final question for you. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2756.32s)]
*  That's what I was asking before, but like now, I mean, I'm halfway through it. I mean, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2759.28s)]
*  like, and I'm thinking like, oh, I think this might be it. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2763.36s)]
*  But I feel like that is the same calculated academic language that comes across cold and [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2766.88s)]
*  disingenuous. And it's this, it's a reskinned version of like, do you the regulatory politics [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2772.88s)]
*  or do regulatory policies and a public private partnership, like let the markets finally, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2779.44s)]
*  you know, let the markets do its thing is not going to get us across the finish line, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2786.96s)]
*  especially when the way that you are presenting this is still no disrespect to Ezra. I think his [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2792.4s)]
*  beard looks great, but a bunch of nerds. Okay. Like they're like the average American sees them. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2799.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. Ezra's job, Ezra's job is to think, right. And so I think that it's fine, right. But in the [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2805.36s)]
*  way that that has to work in politics, it needs a messenger. And I think one of the things in which, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2810.96s)]
*  you know, what I would claim is like an abundance kind of war in the lane of liberals have not had [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2816.0s)]
*  is a is an ability to translate that message to a broader audience. And, and one, I would say, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2821.28s)]
*  some of those kind of, I don't think I don't mean this about him, because I don't think he's [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2829.44s)]
*  actually like this, but some of those nerds haven't wanted to translate that message. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2833.12s)]
*  Right. And it's been actually a kind of haughtiness around it. It's smug. It's elitist. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2836.64s)]
*  It is exactly what I'm like. I would say this all the time to some folks. I'm like, and I say this, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2841.04s)]
*  even though I mean, I would say that I include some leftists in this too. Like if your message [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2847.2s)]
*  of defund, for example, this is an obvious one. Like if I'm in black communities and you haven't [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2851.3599999999997s)]
*  convinced anybody, if I'm in these Latino, if I'm in the places that are experiencing the brunt of [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2856.88s)]
*  police violence and nobody here agrees with you, that is an organizing problem. Like that is a, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2860.96s)]
*  that is a problem that's completely independent of media. That's completely independent of [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2866.48s)]
*  Republicans on the other side. It feels to me as if some of that was not a desire to go to those [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2870.4s)]
*  people and feel like they are worthy of hearing that case. Or look, it's the abolition argument [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2875.04s)]
*  as well. Like the, I understand the morality behind abolition. And I understand that like many [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2880.8s)]
*  activists, if you talk to them, many anarchists, if you talk to them are actually incredibly [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2886.16s)]
*  reasonable on this issue where they're not actually saying like no more laws or no more [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2889.44s)]
*  like regulatory force. They just want to democratize the process better so that like the outcomes [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2895.52s)]
*  actually protect and serve the broader public. So on the messaging front, on the messaging agenda, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2900.0s)]
*  yes, there is a lot of like, on the left, I wouldn't say it's more so a problem with like [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2906.0s)]
*  academic language, but more so about moral purity and presenting yourself as like morally pure. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2910.96s)]
*  On the neoliberal side, it certainly is, you're muted by the way. You muted yourself. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2917.2s)]
*  Yeah, I was just agreeing with you. It's academic. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2923.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's this like academic language. Ultimately, I think, like I said, it goes, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2925.6s)]
*  it still goes back to the structural hurdles when like the left, the left is despised by [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2932.8s)]
*  both the liberals within the Democratic Party. And that much we have also seen in the way that [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2939.68s)]
*  other people are now being moved into the left camp. Like when you're criticizing Indivisible [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2945.6s)]
*  and like, you know, other like Democratic Party funnel groups that are there to organize [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2950.88s)]
*  door knock for you, fundraise for you, if you're calling them the sunrise movement, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2957.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, if you're a computer of, you know, socialist Marxist radicals that demand too much, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2963.12s)]
*  go yell at the Republicans like you've lost it. Like you've lost the plot in its own right. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2968.0s)]
*  You've lost the plot in its entirety. You have no organizational capability and you have no [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2974.24s)]
*  interest in actually organizing at all. And so I think. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2978.72s)]
*  I would say like, that's a big lesson I took from the last couple years. And I remember us talking [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2985.2799999999997s)]
*  about it too, was like remove policy, remove even politics. There is a process problem among the [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2989.3599999999997s)]
*  Democratic Party where they're not actually used to being in conversation with their voters. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2994.96s)]
*  And so I actually found a lot of the politicians to be uncomfortable with a legitimate expression [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=2999.6s)]
*  of democracy, as I would say, of like, of people actually pushing back and thinking of their jobs [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3005.68s)]
*  as having to hear that. Because one thing I would always be like, is if you had, you know, like, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3011.04s)]
*  you know, to the point of Indivisible or something, I'm like, if you were someone over the last couple [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3015.28s)]
*  years who were engaging with the fact of how Americans felt about Biden, you were head in [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3020.0s)]
*  sand. What were you as a politician outside? Like you, you could not tell me your constituents [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3025.2s)]
*  did not bring it up. You could not tell me that. I know that's true. So I'm like, some of it is [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3030.16s)]
*  actually because the party had talked so much about, you know, duty to the president, and they would [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3034.72s)]
*  not talk about duty to their own voters. They didn't even see their own job as being reactive [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3039.9199999999996s)]
*  to those voters. And so I'm like, some of what you're talking about here is like, not even just [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3044.24s)]
*  the people involved, or even the policies that they choose, but that there is a process problem [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3048.56s)]
*  among partisan politics, or if they have, where I would actually say, Republicans at this point, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3055.04s)]
*  under Trump, are much more used to interacting with their base and the uncomforts of that [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3059.92s)]
*  than Democrats are. And so some of that is literally, I think some of that Indivisible [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3065.36s)]
*  uncomfort is because I think particularly congressional Democrats aren't used to being [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3071.6s)]
*  held accountable by their own voters. Oh, yeah. No, this is, I mean, and it is reflected in the [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3078.16s)]
*  like, high informational voter cycle. Democrats for years have trained their most loyal partisans [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3085.12s)]
*  into saying, democracy is not important. These public servants are not accountable to the public. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3093.7599999999998s)]
*  They are marginally the better option in comparison to the scary Republicans. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3100.32s)]
*  And that's why you still hear it. I always, I used to have a joke in my community where I'd be like, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3104.72s)]
*  show me the pay stubs. Are you a DNC operative? Do you work for the Democratic Party? Why are you [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3109.2799999999997s)]
*  here defending the Democrats and their ineptitude for free? Like it doesn't make any sense. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3114.8s)]
*  You know, you're not near a Tandon. You're not Matt Iglesias. You're not getting paid by these [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3121.28s)]
*  groups. And yet here you are on your own volition, defending the ineptitude of the Democratic Party, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3125.6000000000004s)]
*  telling, telling me that no, better things are not possible. This is not a winning message. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3132.48s)]
*  And they've lost time and time again. And obviously something needs to change. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3139.2000000000003s)]
*  Something needs to change within the Democratic Party or it's over. It's just completely done. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3143.52s)]
*  And I think the bottom fell out though. I think even among the people I know who I used to probably [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3148.96s)]
*  have that same topic, like I think this is particularly true of like, you know, there's [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3155.2s)]
*  an identity piece to partisanship too. You know, you feel as if defining yourself against the other [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3159.2s)]
*  side is important, but I feel like in reaction to this election, I heard Democrats kind of [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3163.92s)]
*  universally say that this was on them. And I feel as if that is not an election reaction I've [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3169.12s)]
*  universally heard. And it's not the same one as I hear online. I still see the kind of like Biden, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3176.96s)]
*  you know, dark Brandon Twitter talking about, we just blame the voters, whatever, whatever. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3182.72s)]
*  Like I think that's a friend, like kind of online hysterical stand. I think the majority of your [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3187.52s)]
*  normal Democrats legitimately feel as if the party failed them. And that's what you're seeing [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3194.6400000000003s)]
*  being channeled into the Bernie AOC thing, right? That's why there's an openness to different types [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3199.6800000000003s)]
*  of figures that there wasn't true before. And frankly, that's why you're seeing some outsiders, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3204.2400000000002s)]
*  I think, like, like lurk around stuff. I mean, Stephen A is doing his crazy LeBron thing now, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3208.7200000000003s)]
*  but before that, when he was on the view talking about all that type of stuff, right? Like, I think [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3213.28s)]
*  there is a growing type of person who is acknowledging that because I find 2024 to [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3218.0s)]
*  be indefensible. Like the route to how they got there, I don't think a person in good faith [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3224.08s)]
*  can really defend that as a working party. Whether it's message, whether it's the individual [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3230.32s)]
*  politician or whether it's process, it's definitely something like something leads to lead to that, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3235.2s)]
*  led to that disaster. No, absolutely. Well, instead, thank you so much for coming on. Once again, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3240.96s)]
*  always a pleasure to have you on. Is there anything you want to promote before we let you go? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3247.2s)]
*  Our new episodes are coming out in the next couple of weeks. They will be running on the daily and [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3252.0s)]
*  the run up feed. And I will also be doing some videos of the times doing some politics explainers [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3255.9199999999996s)]
*  about what to focus on during Trump. I think there's way too much news right now. I think you have [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3261.3599999999997s)]
*  to know when you cut through the noise. And so I'm trying to make up like a series of things [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3265.4399999999996s)]
*  of being like, okay, what are the terms we need to know? What are the things that you should know [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3269.52s)]
*  to understand the kind of broader project that we were talking about at the beginning? Because I [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3273.52s)]
*  feel like, you know, that kind of targeted understanding of this administration will last [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3278.0s)]
*  a lot more than, you know, getting the deluge of news that comes at us every day. So when you see [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3282.72s)]
*  it, share it, check it out and tell the times you want more of them. Hell yeah. Thank you, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3288.48s)]
*  Ested. Have a good one, man. All right. That was the third Herndon of the New York Times, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3292.24s)]
*  one of my favorite recurring guests on the show. Hopefully that was an enlightening conversation. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3297.2s)]
*  Ested, of course, is not reflective of the broader base of media in general. So do not mistake [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3302.4s)]
*  yourselves in the thinking, do not delude yourselves in the thinking. Well, a lot of [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3308.96s)]
*  journalists are on the ball and on the money. No, by definition, his job requires him to go out and [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3312.96s)]
*  talk to people and not stay within the DC blob, not stay within the DMV zone. And that is precisely [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3320.56s)]
*  the reason why he has these sorts of opinions, is broadly reflective of the values that you [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3329.36s)]
*  present in this community and what you've grown accustomed to. So remember that. But that's also [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3338.56s)]
*  part of the reason why I always say there are still fantastic journalists out there, and they're [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3347.28s)]
*  incredibly valuable. They're an unimaginably valuable resource, even at outlets such as the [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3352.88s)]
*  New York Times and many other places, despite the fact that on issues like Israel-Palestine, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3358.88s)]
*  obviously, they have dropped the ball spectacularly, and not even dropped the ball, but like actively [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3365.52s)]
*  harm and do appeals to more genocide. So. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUd4BgCcfA&t=3370.56s)]
