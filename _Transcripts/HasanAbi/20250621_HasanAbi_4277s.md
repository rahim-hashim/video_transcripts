*  Defense of democracies admiral welcome great to have you mike. Thanks for being so since you're a navy man [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=113.54s)]
*  Let's start with the u.s [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=118.58000000000001s)]
*  Navy assets in the middle east region a second carrier group the nimitz is going into the arabian sea this weekend [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=119.38000000000001s)]
*  How significant is it to have two carrier groups in the region? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  Well, the big change is going to be the nimitz was scheduled to come it's coming faster [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=130.74s)]
*  And I imagine the carl vinson strike group here will now stay [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=134.18s)]
*  Okay [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=137.78s)]
*  So we'll build up and what that does is double the number of navy fighter attack aircraft from say 50 to 100 that are available [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=138.1s)]
*  To conduct operations [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=145.06s)]
*  The other big navy groups up here. Okay, so these five destroyers and there won't always be five exactly here are positioned in the eastern mediterranean [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=146.82s)]
*  medium-range ballistic missile defense of israel [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  Against weapons fired from iran or and they can do some limited work against stuff coming from the hooties down here [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=157.54s)]
*  But they have a unique capability with the sm3 missile so they're big players [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=163.78s)]
*  These destroyers are still remaining in the red sea. Okay against hootie attacks truckston [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  The four shermans, right? Okay [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=175.14s)]
*  um, so let's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=177.54s)]
*  Move on here. We go. So the most like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=179.14s)]
*  Dude is awesome [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=183.62s)]
*  We got our most diabetic admiral to talk about [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=185.38s)]
*  to basically huff and puff [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=189.7s)]
*  between [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=192.34s)]
*  Uh fantasizing about how we'll strike iran and how hard we'll strike them [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=193.54s)]
*  Great. Thank you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=198.1s)]
*  This dude is about to get struck by heart disease while he's on camera [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=199.62s)]
*  Okay, the only thing he struck is a donut [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  These are the facilities that have been attacked by the israelis [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=207.38s)]
*  Fordo is the big one that everybody's concerned about right now [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=211.22s)]
*  It is not in downtown tehran the iranian capital your thoughts on the targets and what about fordo? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=215.14s)]
*  I think one of the funniest parts about this is that there is no guarantee that even the b2 [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=222.74s)]
*  with its uh, uh, what is it called like mof or whatever the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=229.62s)]
*  It's like the step above a bunker buster [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=234.66s)]
*  Even the b2 is not guaranteed to strike with the with the gb57 [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=238.18s)]
*  No, not moab. No, not the not the moab the mother of all the mop [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=244.98s)]
*  Um is not guaranteed to actually [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=250.01999999999998s)]
*  Uh the the is guaranteed to actually hit fordo. So this could this could basically be entirely in vain [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=254.5s)]
*  Yeah, massive ordinance penetrator the mop m. Op [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=262.74s)]
*  Thank you chatter [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=267.14s)]
*  Thank god. I have so many missile autists in here and so many plane autists as well [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=269.3s)]
*  but basically [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=275.78s)]
*  Uh as far as I have read [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=277.53999999999996s)]
*  And again, this is not my area of expertise at all [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=280.41999999999996s)]
*  but everything that I read from [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=284.73999999999995s)]
*  Analysts everything that I've read from people who uh love this kind of shit [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=287.2s)]
*  There is no real guarantee that they can even strike the facility that's deep underground on the side of a goddamn mountain [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=292.74s)]
*  That they're even fantasizing about which would [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=298.9s)]
*  Imply that america would be joining this america would be joining this this uh, this this military conquest [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=301.94s)]
*  With no real military ambition beyond simply escalating it because their ultimate goal is [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=309.78s)]
*  to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=318.34s)]
*  Destabilize iran. Yeah, it's not just a guarantee [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=319.28s)]
*  It's a certainty that it will take at minimum hours of multiple strikes for the two b2s [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=322.1s)]
*  They deployed if it's possible at all. They are specialized in striking [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=325.54s)]
*  Basements not sub mountain complexes. Yes [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=328.82s)]
*  Having said that however the very fact that they do have air superiority over iran. Let's be real [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=331.86s)]
*  Uh, I don't I can't speak on the area of fordow [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=337.94s)]
*  But the areas that they have struck so far it is very clear that the the israeli air force currently has air superiority over [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  many parts of iran [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=346.98s)]
*  um so much so that like when uh the the iranian foreign minister has to travel they have to inform israel at this point [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=348.5s)]
*  uh that their travel and uh [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  That the I think the first strike was so successful like the masada operation was so successful in taking out a big chunk of their [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=358.34s)]
*  anti-air defenses [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=364.42s)]
*  With the drone operation that they had and then the subsequent strikes that the israeli air force did [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=365.94s)]
*  uh hyper focused on the the additional anti-air defense systems that they had that they're like [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=370.74s)]
*  incapable of of even putting up a uh [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  Incapable of putting up any sort of anti-aircraft defense against [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  Flights that are happening. So maybe they can do multiple hits on the fordow facility [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=386.42s)]
*  But even then once again not entirely certain if they'll be able to even penetrate the thing having said that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't think that's the goal. Anyway, I don't think that's a that's the real goal [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=397.3s)]
*  I just like I don't think the negotiations were the real goal. I don't think that they want to like the the negotiations between like, uh, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=400.5s)]
*  America and iran where america's position was maximalist which was no more nukes [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=407.62s)]
*  No more nuclear facilities at all, even though they literally have nuclear facilities, uh in uh in in [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=412.74s)]
*  Collaboration with russia and another facility in collaboration with china. Um [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=420.88s)]
*  They wanted to say no more facilities at all. You can't have a civilian infrastructure [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=425.94s)]
*  nuclear power whatsoever [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=431.22s)]
*  and that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=433.3s)]
*  Uh, you are not [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=434.98s)]
*  You're not allowed to have that you can maybe have a power grid from another country [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=437.3s)]
*  But you can't have sovereignty and I think the real reason was [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=442.74s)]
*  That that that was even a point of contention. That was the maximalist position [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=446.90000000000003s)]
*  Here was because it violates iranian sovereignty weakens the iranian regime [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=452.82000000000005s)]
*  With the ultimate goal of destabilization down the line [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=457.78000000000003s)]
*  CNN's van jones tells liberals to get on board with trump's stance on iran iran can't have weapons [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=461.94s)]
*  Wow, never thought i'd see the day that the media says something so bipartisan and factual [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=466.58s)]
*  What yeah, you have never listened to the democrats then dummy democrats love [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=471.38s)]
*  Uh fantasizing about the notion of he's buying himself some time. God. I hate vangel so much. God. Damn it [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=476.64s)]
*  I hate all these pieces of shit. It's crazy [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=481.53999999999996s)]
*  It's crazy [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=484.02s)]
*  God damn it. The liberals are so ass bro. This is once again [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=485.46s)]
*  Like not even trying hard to manufacture consent at this point. They're not even trying they're just like dude shut it up [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=490.41999999999996s)]
*  And and be on board with this. That's it [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  Trump isn't even trying he's like, I don't know [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=499.78s)]
*  Maybe i'll maybe I won't they're not negotiating. It's like they were negotiating. What the fuck do you mean? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=503.21999999999997s)]
*  You were saying they were negotiating last week [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=508.41999999999996s)]
*  And then israel struck them and you were like, haha. We actually did this super cool super secret thing [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=511.38s)]
*  Which is to violate [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=517.46s)]
*  every principle of of diplomacy [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=520.02s)]
*  by [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=523.14s)]
*  Letting israel do whatever the fuck it wants in the process of negotiations. This doesn't make any sense [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=524.26s)]
*  They're not even trying they're not even actively trying and I don't know why they're not even actively trying [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=530.18s)]
*  Maybe they've just like dropped all notion of democracy there where it's more like a might-is-right politics [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=535.38s)]
*  And what the fuck are you going to do about it at the domestic level where they're basically saying like, you know [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=541.06s)]

*  Here's vangel's talk about how iran is in a normal country and therefore progressives should embrace the idea of bombing iran [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1096.9s)]
*  Iran is a country where they blind women for showing some hair and the u.s [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1101.94s)]
*  Is a country where they make a dead woman give birth perhaps iran and the rest of the world should devise their foreign policy [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1104.9s)]
*  Towards the u.s accordingly [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1109.38s)]
*  Well and death to all the jews one of those should offend you if you're progressives at least one should offend you [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1111.46s)]
*  And so the question though is no they don't even say death to all the jews [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1116.74s)]
*  They say death to israel for the record and even if they were to say all of those things [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1119.7s)]
*  That's not a justification for killing all of the the iranian population. What are we doing? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1124.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1130.66s)]
*  Does anyone actually believe this bullshit? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1131.7s)]
*  I think like a lot of boomers still definitely believe this because there's like this is a a relitigation of of [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1133.38s)]
*  so much [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1140.1000000000001s)]
*  So much islamophobia that was necessary to justify the war [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1141.7s)]
*  Uh the the war on terror the failure that is the war on terror [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1146.82s)]
*  And they just quickly snap back to that position and they're trying to relitigate it [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1150.5s)]
*  They're trying to churn it out so that the american population is on board with the action that we take in iran [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1154.1000000000001s)]
*  Except it doesn't seem like the american population is taking [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1158.74s)]
*  Taking on this message even if they hate deep hate even if they have deep hatred against every muslim [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1162.26s)]
*  Most americans still understand that iraq was a failure afghanistan was a failure at least from their perspective [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1168.6599999999999s)]
*  Right. Yeah by van jones logic [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1175.78s)]
*  We should also bomb israel because death to arabs is literally so common to say that they literally have [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1177.4599999999998s)]
*  Cytrans songs about killing arabs and burning down the villages. Yeah, may your village burn and death to arabs is the most common [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1181.6799999999998s)]
*  uh [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1187.6200000000001s)]
*  It's a super popular song. They have multiple songs like that [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1188.82s)]
*  You're right the relitigation and the way to frame it is the same old position same [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1193.46s)]
*  Should my parents just rattle off the sick part is my parents with the colombia so did I [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1196.66s)]
*  But i'm not speaking to my dad over this loser [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1200.1000000000001s)]
*  I just I I don't even think it matters that there isn't enough appetite to go to war with iran [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1202.42s)]
*  I still fear I still fear that eventually here's what's going to happen [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1208.58s)]
*  If america strikes iran and iran hits american military bases or like kills americans, okay [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1213.94s)]
*  Hits like uss nimitz or something, right? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1219.8600000000001s)]
*  One of the carriers or something somehow [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1223.06s)]
*  That's it. It's over most americans will go. All right. Well, yep. This is an unstable country [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1225.94s)]
*  It's time to go to war baby. Hell. Yeah, I think a lot of americans who are currently still restrained [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1230.26s)]
*  And and currently still demand that we don't go to war with iran [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1236.58s)]
*  Will probably get on board or at least enough of them will get on board but the reality the scary reality [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1240.98s)]
*  Is the scary reality is even if they weren't even if there was like a 60% disapproval even after iran [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1247.38s)]
*  Strikes back at like american positions after america hits iran directly [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1254.66s)]
*  Even if there was tremendous [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1260.3400000000001s)]
*  Tremendous uprisings in the country they would still go. Okay. What are you gonna do? Shut that up [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1263.0400000000002s)]
*  They would just prosecute and arrest people [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1268.5s)]
*  on uh us oil [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1271.3799999999999s)]
*  And they would continue doing whatever the they want to do. This is the next step I think [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1273.7s)]
*  In our history. This is what's coming is [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1279.54s)]
*  if [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1282.98s)]
*  If we strike iran and iran retaliates against american military positions american military bases, which is well within their right at that point [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1283.78s)]
*  Okay [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1291.7s)]
*  And remember we're not even striking like just a regular part of iran. We're hitting a nuclear facility [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1292.66s)]
*  Okay, a nuclear facility remember how much back and forth took place when? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1298.66s)]
*  Uh, some of the nuclear facilities were damaged in ukraine [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1304.58s)]
*  The fears that people had the understandable fears that people had america is now openly [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1307.94s)]
*  salivating at the prospect of destroying an iranian nuclear facility with with [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1313.44s)]
*  massive ordinance penetrators [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1319.94s)]
*  And then if iran retaliates against that which is what they said they would do and they are well within their legal right to do [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1322.74s)]
*  so at that point and [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1328.74s)]
*  uh americans still hate that and still don't want to go to war [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1330.74s)]
*  With iran and they take it to the streets [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1335.3s)]
*  We're just basically going to do the same shit that we did [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1338.42s)]
*  And this time with uh, maybe even more legal backing [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1342.18s)]
*  because in times of war [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1347.78s)]
*  In times of war in the past [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1350.74s)]
*  America has stamped out any sort of political opposition [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1352.98s)]
*  uh against the wars [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1356.66s)]
*  eugene debbs [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1358.66s)]
*  the most successful the most famous, uh socialist attempt at the presidency had to run [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1360.1s)]
*  Because he was a conscientious objector to world war one. He had to run from prison [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1366.5s)]
*  So you will really see how little america gives up about the first amendment [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1370.8999999999999s)]
*  In time uh in in uh, you know potential world war three territory [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1374.6599999999999s)]
*  Is the who and how [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1384.8999999999999s)]
*  Is israel gonna take out this nuclear capacity by dropping people there who blow it up? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1386.8999999999999s)]
*  Or is america going to take it out by dropping a bomb that blows it up, but that but but [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1393.06s)]
*  What dude what kind of israel? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1396.58s)]
*  Can't even drop its people to kill babies in in gaza [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1399.46s)]
*  israel [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1405.54s)]
*  How many troops did israel drop? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1407.22s)]
*  Against iraq. So do you mean israel is going to put? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1410.82s)]
*  actual troops israel is going to actually put [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1414.8999999999999s)]
*  a single [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1419.78s)]
*  Israeli in harm's way that is the least likely event [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1421.28s)]
*  of all time [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1426.5s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1428.74s)]
*  What kind of idiotic statement is this half of the troops that explode in the gaza strip [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1431.06s)]
*  Explode because they're too afraid to get out of the goddamn tanks [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1437.84s)]
*  So after the air force rolls in and reduces the entire strip to rubble tanks roll through the streets and because they're so fearful [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1441.7s)]
*  Of offering infantry to the tanks to protect the tanks as is normal standard operating procedure for every army you got [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1450.42s)]
*  18 year olds [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1458.48s)]
*  crawling out of holes in the ground and dropping [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1459.78s)]
*  bathtub rockets on the side of these tanks and lighting the the [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1463.44s)]
*  19 20 year old rear admiral generals on fire in the gaza strip [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1468.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't even think america would drop troops into iran that would be devastating. It would be devastating for iran certainly [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1472.8999999999999s)]
*  But it would also be in insanely consequential for america. It would be the end of america. What an insane [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1479.3799999999999s)]
*  What an insane assumption [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1486.18s)]
*  You're doing state versus state warfare with a country whose entire [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1489.14s)]
*  Whose entire troops? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1496.02s)]
*  Are expressly tasked with guerrilla warfare. I can't like it would be vietnam [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1498.5800000000002s)]
*  But probably even worse than vietnam [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1504.3400000000001s)]
*  And vietnam did get a lot of help from uh, of course other [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1506.98s)]
*  Other countries on the on the soviet side as well in terms of like [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1510.98s)]
*  I mean ussr weapons and things of that nature and I suspect that iran will probably have [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1514.74s)]
*  at that point [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1519.7s)]
*  Similar help so when this is the when this is the assessment [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1520.9s)]
*  Okay, when this is the assessment on the table if I can see this do you think? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1526.02s)]
*  America and american advisors are incapable of seeing this. Of course, they're they're not they are able to see all of these [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1531.94s)]
*  Potential results so why are they still doing this? This is where it comes down to [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1540.1000000000001s)]
*  How much they rely on israel from an advisory position? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1545.46s)]
*  And I think this is the other side. This is the ideological zealotry [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1550.2600000000002s)]
*  And and the the unlimited confidence that they have [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1554.98s)]
*  within israel play [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1558.5800000000002s)]
*  Playing a major role in why they're letting israel lead the pack [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1561.14s)]
*  Obviously, they're not leading the pack in terms of like putting their bodies on the line [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1566.1000000000001s)]
*  But like leading the pack in terms of the advisory role that they play [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1569.38s)]
*  No, it's not blackmail. I don't think blackmail is that consequential in this day and age. I think it's just simply [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1573.78s)]
*  ideological zealotry these guys are [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1581.04s)]
*  these guys are [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1585.14s)]
*  zionists ultra zionists through and through they have they have uh, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1586.82s)]
*  complete commitment [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1592.3400000000001s)]
*  To the greater israeli project [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1594.18s)]
*  They truly believe it they truly believe that these they're almost like philosomatic in the way that the the uh, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1596.8200000000002s)]
*  Japanese empire was you know what I mean where they're like no, these are like [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1602.98s)]
*  Magic military people they know what they're doing. It's um, you know, they are incredible. They're incredible warfare [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1606.8200000000002s)]
*  They're they're they're a nation of of special people that can do tremendous warfare. I promise I can I believe it [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1615.46s)]
*  Of course, we have to listen to what they have to say their intelligence is amazing [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1621.94s)]
*  Occam's razor would say blackmail is more likely than magical thinking no [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1626.74s)]
*  This is not magical thinking. It's just social conditioning. It's not [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1631.5400000000002s)]
*  I'm exaggerating when I say these are magical warfare people. Okay [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1636.18s)]
*  That's i'm embellishing [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1640.2600000000002s)]
*  But no, it's not it's not that it's not that crazy to assume [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1642.74s)]
*  that [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1647.46s)]
*  Half a century of pro-israel propaganda that is deeply embedded in every orifice of american society [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1648.66s)]
*  All the way up to like institutes of higher learning has probably taken a formative role in shaping the ideology [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1656.02s)]
*  of of americans in position of power in positions of power [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1663.5400000000002s)]
*  Especially considering how formative of a role israel has played in our grand design in the region [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1668.26s)]
*  So it's both it's both the the mer-sheimer principle of like the israel lobby and its pervasive influence [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1673.94s)]
*  But it's also noam chomsky's attitude, which is that israel's an extension of america [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1680.34s)]
*  but that is precisely the reason because it's uh, it's a bit of both that uh, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1684.5s)]
*  there are instances where [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1690.18s)]
*  There are instances where like, um, israel steps out of line or actually will make decisions that are not as calculated as people think [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1693.06s)]
*  They are but america lets them do it no magical thinking is a psychology term basically means that an adult has an idealized [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1700.26s)]
*  View of a person or entity scenario like disney or marvel brain. No, I know i'm i'm just saying that that's not [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1706.02s)]
*  it's not magical thinking at all they just [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1711.62s)]
*  uh, they are they are just like heavily invested in uh in believing that israel is like much more capable of a war-fighting [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1714.02s)]
*  nation than than israel actually is [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1722.18s)]
*  Is [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1724.58s)]
*  But the what and the why are clear and I think progressors should get on board with that [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1725.78s)]
*  We cannot have a nuclear armed iran. I was in the region you were in the region [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1729.62s)]
*  This is a very dangerous power that cannot get a nuclear weapon [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1734.66s)]
*  By the way, you should listen to this at some point will the us be dragged into war? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1738.9s)]
*  I sometimes take questions on my instagram stories and while I usually answer by writing [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1743.22s)]
*  Which I already did in this case. I'm particularly inspired [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1748.34s)]
*  Who's this person? I don't know who this person is [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1752.58s)]
*  By the way, you should listen to this at some point. It's long. So it might be too much to stream for stream [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1755.3s)]
*  She's really a brilliant analyst [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1759.6999999999998s)]
*  Pretext new state department announces us citizens lightly wounded by iranian counter-strike several uss were lightly wounded as a result of the impact [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1762.6599999999999s)]
*  Of an iranian strike state department tells [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1768.58s)]
*  Uh cbs us is unaware of any us citizens death in israel and in the west bank [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1770.58s)]
*  I mean, we know when israel kills american citizens directly nothing changes [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1775.78s)]
*  So it'd be really interesting to see how they turn around and go. Well iranian rockets lightly wounded [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1781.46s)]
*  Lightly grazed an american [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1787.6200000000001s)]
*  Uh a a piece of hair on an american's head. So I think it's time to nuke iran [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1789.78s)]
*  To make a video. Yeah, scott jennings scott jennings scraped his knee [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1795.3s)]

*  Uh an iranian strike. I'm not gonna watch the whole thing. I'm gonna just see the first minute of it question [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1805.46s)]
*  We are thursday june 19th, 2025 six days ago [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1810.74s)]
*  Israel launched its largest ever strike on iran an unprecedented aerial assault targeting nuclear facilities [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1816.02s)]
*  IRGC command centers and air defense systems across the country [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1823.04s)]
*  Key iranian military leaders were killed nuclear centrifuge networks disabled and state media bombed during a live broadcast [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1827.62s)]
*  Not to mention the civilians who were killed [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1835.9399999999998s)]
*  In response iran launched an unprecedented wave of missiles and drones at israel striking tel aviv haifa and other major cities [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1839.1399999999999s)]
*  And now many are wondering if the united states will be dragged into war and this is my answer [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1847.22s)]
*  The united states will not be dragged into war the united states has been plotting for this war for a long time [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1854.1s)]
*  It is its architect [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1860.58s)]
*  Saying it's being dragged is like saying p diddy got dragged to his own parties. He's the host [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1862.34s)]
*  And the u.s is the architect of this war not a reluctant participant. Let me explain [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1868.34s)]
*  One of the great misconceptions about the united states is that the is the belief that the president is the ultimate decision maker [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1874.1s)]
*  akin to an emperor or a king in the classical sense [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1881.54s)]
*  No, the decision maker is not donald trump nor has any other president before him ever held control over u.s foreign policy [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1884.82s)]
*  The decision maker or architect of u.s foreign policy is the national security state [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1893.06s)]
*  What does this mean the organs of the shallow and deep state the pentagon the headquarters of the u.s military [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1898.34s)]
*  The state department the u.s equivalent of a ministry of foreign affairs the cia and the intelligence community [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1905.06s)]
*  And layered beneath them are the corporate and military industrial lobbies and powerful interest groups [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1911.22s)]
*  oil and israel [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1918.6599999999999s)]
*  apac and beyond [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1921.3s)]
*  One could even include the hidden influence of secretive networks freemasons and other underground elites [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1922.82s)]
*  Some very very dark all embedded together. Think jeffrey epstein a convicted sex trafficker [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1929.62s)]
*  Alleged mosad agent and operator of a global black male ring involving underage girls [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1935.9399999999998s)]
*  The epstein files are still sealed by u.s courts allegedly containing the names of presidents royals billionaires and intelligence operatives [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1942.34s)]
*  All accused of rape abuse and trafficking of chow the same files elon musk [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1951.3200000000002s)]
*  Recently accused trump of being in before quietly deleting the tweet read with me [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1956.76s)]
*  Time to drop the really big bomb donald trump is in the epstein files [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1963.16s)]
*  That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day donald j trump [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1967.72s)]
*  You see this is not fantasy. It's part of the constellation of power that surrounds insulates and protects the system [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1972.8400000000001s)]
*  That is the national security state the president is not the architect at best [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1980.28s)]
*  He's a rotating spokesperson for interests that are far more permanent than his ego [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1985.24s)]
*  And often he owes his power his protection and his silence to the very deep networks that put him there [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1990.28s)]
*  Okay [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1996.68s)]
*  Even though campaign trails are filled with partisan rhetoric and dramatic contrasts. It's all theater [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=1997.8799999999999s)]
*  U.s foreign policy has remained remarkably consistent across administrations [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2005.1599999999999s)]
*  republican or democrat [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2009.9599999999998s)]
*  Dove or hawk the illusion of change from one president to the next is a performance staged for voters voters [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2011.8s)]
*  Too busy trying to stay out of a hospital that would bankrupt them to notice that it's exactly the same policy [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2018.52s)]
*  Repackaged every four years. I'm not even kidding if the american people were not drowning in medical debt [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2024.4199999999998s)]
*  They might actually have time and clarity to notice the con [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2030.28s)]
*  I don't know who I don't know who linked this. I don't know. This is my favorite chat freak out. She said freemasons [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2034.1200000000001s)]
*  she believes in [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2041.0800000000002s)]
*  Bro, what the I had to go pee literally for for a minute [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2043.3200000000002s)]
*  And I left chat alone with one fucking video and all of a sudden it's freemasons. God damn it [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2049.48s)]
*  She's wobble some of the analysis is good. Okay, stop [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2057.32s)]
*  Today I saw a shredded baby in gaza for probably the 30th time in the past 20 months scores of starving people are killed lining up [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2060.6800000000003s)]
*  For scraps and and a daily sadistic mass killing ritual. This is what normal countries like israel and the u.s do [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2065.88s)]
*  CNN tells us reality has no meaning what sustains alternative reality is not [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2072.84s)]
*  If not a sophisticated mix of racism corruption chauvinism and a quick and unforgiving system of harsh disciplining of anyone with a conscience [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2077.7200000000003s)]
*  Are you afraid of getting out analyzed? Yes [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2085.4s)]
*  Shahid 136 drones do serious damage [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2088.12s)]
*  Iran launched a drone which successfully penetrated all american israeli air defense systems evaded by evaded pursued by helicopters and targeted the house and occupied [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2091.1600000000003s)]
*  City of bayt shan seems like a targeted assassination with high precision. So that's the other thing I was going to talk about [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2098.2000000000003s)]
*  um the we we didn't even get to it yet, but [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2104.6800000000003s)]
*  a lot of the a lot of the the iranian strikes have been penetrating the air defenses [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2108.12s)]
*  A lot of the iranian strikes regardless of their uh, regardless of whether or not [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2115.08s)]
*  their their capabilities [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2121.56s)]
*  of launching multiple missiles at once [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2124.12s)]
*  It does seem like the israeli air defenses have been drained [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2127.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay, because now [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2133.0s)]
*  They're launching less missiles and less drones and yet the precision has gone up [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2135.4s)]
*  Significantly part of that is because they're using newer technology now [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2141.6200000000003s)]
*  They dump the older payload early on and now they're actually using faster missiles and newer technology [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2145.7200000000003s)]
*  Which the air defenses are completely incapable of of intercepting but it is it is interesting [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2152.1200000000003s)]
*  to note that [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2159.48s)]
*  the strikes have have continued regardless [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2161.56s)]
*  Of the israeli air superiority that they claim they have over the iranian airspace now iran is a massive country [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2165.98s)]
*  Very difficult to be everywhere all at once very difficult to to figure out whether or not these [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2173.18s)]
*  constantly moving [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2180.7599999999998s)]
*  uh constantly moving missile delivery systems are are [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2182.52s)]
*  Are evading the israeli air force, but this is this is not a good sign for israel [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2186.14s)]
*  Just then new footage reveals the moment when an iranian drone struck the base on area israeli air defenses failed to shoot down the kamikaze drone [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2192.06s)]
*  Now granting the iranians greater air superiority over the occupied territories as it fails to shoot down much slower munitions [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2197.98s)]
*  Early strikes was probing for weak points in their defenses so that when they were to send in the better tech the increase the likelihood [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2205.98s)]
*  Of actually hitting their targets [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2211.34s)]
*  I thought that they were also I thought that they were also hitting um [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2213.2599999999998s)]
*  the the air defenses as well like the [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2217.58s)]
*  The the missile launchers as well. I'm pretty sure they hit a bunch of missile launchers early on [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2221.18s)]
*  Obviously, they don't have the same capabilities that masad had in terms of like deep penetration into israeli society [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2226.62s)]
*  Where they could like launch a bunch of drones internally and like blow up some of the anti-air defense missile systems [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2231.98s)]
*  anti-air anti-air defense systems [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2238.14s)]
*  but [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2241.8999999999996s)]
*  Considering that israel supposedly have has air superiority over iran [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2242.7s)]
*  I don't understand how they're not capable of taking out all of their launchers [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2247.18s)]
*  And they're still eating [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2252.06s)]
*  They're still eating drone strikes and also with the limited [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2254.7s)]
*  uh [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2259.02s)]
*  The the limited ballistic missiles they do send those limited missiles that they do send end up actually striking israel [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2259.82s)]
*  Now the calculation here for israel if they are committed to defending their civilian population [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2266.38s)]
*  as their [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2272.86s)]
*  uh as their defense capabilities are diminishing [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2273.9s)]

*  This is the most normal term to use [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2286.86s)]

*  Jesus christ what is happening? Anyway lock in [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2291.7400000000002s)]
*  The point that I was trying to make is that if yemen and the other regional actors [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2297.42s)]
*  Still have munitions and a capability and an interest to strike [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2303.66s)]
*  Let's say iran is holding back on his bullah launching any sort of missile operations into israel [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2309.1s)]
*  until [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2316.62s)]
*  the war escalates until america joins in and then [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2317.82s)]
*  And then while iran is striking american targets [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2323.02s)]
*  You can have hezbollah and yemen strike a diminished israel that [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2327.58s)]
*  in in previous times would have been able to easily [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2333.34s)]
*  Intercept missiles coming in from hezbollah and missiles coming in from yemen not as easily for missiles coming in from yemen because they have bigger [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2338.68s)]
*  ones as well but [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2346.86s)]
*  But still because yemen does not have the the precise targeting capabilities that like iran has but if they're [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2348.86s)]
*  If their anti-air defenses have diminished [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2357.42s)]
*  significantly [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2361.56s)]
*  All of a sudden those other countries the remaining militancy in the region within the axis of resistance [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2363.98s)]
*  Can actually move towards israel to do big damage just something to consider as [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2371.1s)]
*  What could be the trump card here? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2378.22s)]
*  So exactly right they've hit natanz isfahan and other iraq and other other sites here and done significant damage [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2381.3399999999997s)]
*  They've been around fordo, but the reality is the president's right [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2388.38s)]
*  Prime minister net yahoo said they could take fordow. I think a fair statement is they could do significant damage to ford [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2392.22s)]
*  Yes, yemen has said that they will time their missiles. They will coordinate their missile strikes with iran [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2398.14s)]
*  But as far as i've seen [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2405.1s)]
*  There hasn't been a lot of movement from yemen [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2407.02s)]
*  so far [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2411.1s)]
*  that could [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2412.38s)]
*  given [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2413.66s)]
*  Yemen's resources and their tenacity I would assume that they are holding off rather than [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2415.18s)]
*  uh rather than having their capacity significantly reduced by the joint israeli and american [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2422.14s)]
*  Uh strikes that took place in zana reuters now reporting what? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2428.62s)]
*  Reuters reports that israeli officials told us officials that they could act on iran's fordow nuclear site before the end of trump's two week deadline [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2434.06s)]
*  Yeah, no shit [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2439.5s)]
*  Yeah, so what we're looking at here is we're being told this is I think anywhere from just off 200 to 300 feet in depth [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2441.82s)]
*  There are all kind of reports out there of a thousand foot, but I think that's more propaganda [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2447.42s)]
*  So what you end up doing is if you saw the movie the latest top gun movie [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2451.26s)]
*  Eerily enough. This is that plot kind of coming to fruition in real life. It's not just one bomb [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2456.06s)]
*  It'll be a bomb after a bomb to get through that penetration and just lastly [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2461.42s)]
*  That's what you're talking about [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2466.14s)]
*  Yeah, penetrate up to 200 feet below the surface and then of course [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2467.34s)]
*  We'll see it try and put the second one in there and go down in there [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2472.06s)]
*  Let's bring in david burke our top gun and former instructor retired u.s. Marine corps officer now david [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2476.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know how well we did that but you know this better than anybody talk to us about you know [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2483.02s)]
*  Questions over whether or not this can successfully be done [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2488.54s)]
*  That joey jones just crushed that explanation you guys hit the nail on the head so [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2492.7s)]
*  Really well done [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2497.98s)]
*  This absolutely can be done. There is not a cave in the world deep enough to defend itself against the american military [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2499.5s)]
*  If it needs to hit it and the weapon system and the aircraft and the mating of that exactly right now [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2504.86s)]
*  This is a hard problem to solve but it is absolutely a solvable problem with this system. This is just like top gun [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2510.38s)]
*  Anyway, this is what the spokesman for yemen's ansarallah. Yahya sari said [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2517.1s)]
*  um [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2522.46s)]
*  Confirming that yemen will target all american navy and commercial vessels in the red sea and bab al [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2523.5s)]
*  Mandab if the u.s. Goes to war with iran [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2529.1s)]
*  This is also part of the reason why they I suspect are holding off on their stockpile and not deploying everything that they have [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2532.54s)]
*  At this moment here. Let's see what he had to say [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2539.1s)]
*  The battle with the israeli enemy the aggressor against iran with what it has previously committed of crimes against the palestinian people [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2542.7799999999997s)]
*  genocide and continuous attacks on the [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2549.56s)]
*  Okay, it's too fast attacks on the lebanese and syrian peoples and the aggression [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2552.06s)]
*  Against yemen then it moved towards a comprehensive aggression [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2557.5s)]
*  Against the islamic republic of iran under the title of changing the face of the middle east [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2561.34s)]
*  And the israeli enemy seeks complete control over the region and implement the zionist plan with open american support [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2565.74s)]
*  An american partnership and is trying to remove [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2572.7799999999997s)]
*  the islamic republic of iran because it considers it the [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2575.82s)]
*  Greatest obstacle to the achievement of its plan therefore any american attack aggression against iran. Yeah, basically [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2579.7400000000002s)]
*  All right, whatever this he just said exactly what the summarization was [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2586.7000000000003s)]
*  that if america gets involved against iran yemen will [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2591.5800000000004s)]
*  restart their uh [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2595.1800000000003s)]
*  their [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2597.1800000000003s)]
*  aggression towards american [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2598.0600000000004s)]
*  navy vessels in the region and um [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2600.7000000000003s)]
*  They'll they'll uh the ceasefire will be [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2605.26s)]
*  Will be nowhere [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2608.7s)]
*  For now, but the only way you're going to destroy fordow and it's not a guarantee, but the only possible way are b2 stealth bombers [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2610.4599999999996s)]
*  Delivering the gbu 57 that 30 000 pound weapon. Okay, so let's continue on [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2618.54s)]
*  This is fordow good look at it. Here's the facility. So you've got tunnel entrances here [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2624.54s)]
*  You got centrifuges beneath the mountain you got a support building at 18 000 square feet a checkpoint there [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2629.9799999999996s)]
*  there's been some suggestion that [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2636.8599999999997s)]
*  Israeli commandos could do the job, but that has great risk [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2639.2599999999998s)]
*  uh, so there is a lot of attention obviously on american might and uh [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2643.2599999999998s)]
*  Was this type of diplomatic breakdown of a ripple effect even outside of the middle east? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2647.8199999999997s)]
*  It depends on what america ends up doing [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2651.2599999999998s)]
*  um, I suspect in the long term who knows this might actually cause a lot of [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2653.66s)]
*  This might actually cause the populations of a lot of these like gulf region [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2659.1s)]
*  States and and all the abraham accord states and even turkey with nato to really reconsider how their leadership has [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2662.38s)]
*  Involved themselves alongside america and israel could potentially lead to some rebellion in these places. They will be violently squashed, of course [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2669.34s)]
*  But that's in the long term in the short term if you're asking me what the calculation is for all of these regional actors [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2677.74s)]
*  They are fully and unconditionally in support of america and israel [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2683.98s)]
*  these guys hate [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2689.58s)]

*  I'm not even factoring in morocco. Obviously. They're a major component here or a major trade partner to israel in perpetuity [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2700.2200000000003s)]
*  but [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2708.7000000000003s)]

*  if you personally think [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2727.5800000000004s)]
*  That the only reason why gulf leadership and abraham accords countries [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2730.6200000000003s)]
*  exclusively released damning statements against israel in an effort to thwart rebellion in their countries because their population [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2736.44s)]
*  Because their populations are obviously anti israel [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2745.1000000000004s)]
*  Uh, you are silly iran is a market competitor iran is a political competitor that is a domineering force in the region [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2748.54s)]

*  He would nut so hard. He's probably been nutting non-stop the joke in the region is if israel was not a jewish country [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2863.2599999999998s)]

*  Shia country the gulf states would have already nuked it out of orbit. Okay, they would have invaded it and destroyed it [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2871.66s)]
*  A long time ago the impact it could have there at fordo exactly right. So the israelis. Oh, I can't listen to this anymore [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2880.62s)]
*  This is a gbu 57 known as a massive ordnance [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2887.98s)]
*  Penetrator at 20 feet long and weighing 30 000 pounds [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2891.82s)]
*  It is the world's largest non-nuclear bomb and can destroy targets buried deep underground earning it the name bunker buster [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2895.9s)]
*  To destroy iran's heavily fortified nuclear facilities experts say these are the conventional weapons with the best chance of success [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2904.38s)]
*  This is a big sucker. It is called the massive ordnance. You don't disrespect morocco. We love palestine here [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2912.86s)]
*  We only trade with israel for security reasons in the sahara problem iran are funding terrorism in the morocco. Sahara [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2918.14s)]
*  Don't reduce it. Do we love israel for no reason? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2923.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2926.7799999999997s)]
*  Exactly. What do you think the uh mbs position is on this? He's that's a carbon copy. You just literally copy pasted [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2928.3799999999997s)]
*  the the gulf [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2937.02s)]
*  You just copy pasted the exact same reason the gulf leadership [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2938.7s)]
*  uh, and and jordan or any number of different players in the [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2943.2599999999998s)]
*  In the region will say [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2947.5s)]
*  Down to the wire. Yeah, no shit word for word uae propaganda word for word mbs's opinion. That's it [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2949.66s)]
*  It's penetrator which basically sums up what it is [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2957.5s)]
*  Here's why the mop represents israel's best chance at destroying iran's facilities and why it can't do it alone [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2960.3799999999997s)]
*  The mop is the largest bunker buster bomb in the u.s arsenal. It's designed. Yes. Yes. I know I know they can't dance in iran [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2966.9399999999996s)]
*  It's illegal to dance in iran mbs is pro dancing [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2973.9s)]
*  Mbs says we will dance again to penetrate hardened targets and plow through almost 200 feet of rock before detonating [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2977.02s)]
*  Due to the mop's weight, they can only be carried by the biggest bombers such as b2s [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2985.42s)]
*  One bomb is unlikely to borrow deep enough to hit iran's nuclear facilities by itself [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2991.26s)]
*  The metal is going to melt at some point [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2996.78s)]
*  And so it does have limitations in terms of how far it can penetrate and that's why you may have to follow it up [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=2998.86s)]
*  With multiple instances you drive a wedge in it expands and then you continue to drive and each time it's more effective [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3003.02s)]
*  In a sense, you're trying to create an earthquake [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3009.9s)]
*  Uh, you're trying to crack the mountain and to channel that that that seismic energy down [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3012.38s)]
*  Uh to make whatever is under there whatever facility is under there [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3017.5s)]
*  Shake around a lot. The mop is equipped with advanced guidance systems including gps to allow for accurate targeting [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3022.22s)]
*  It is also fitted with a delayed fuse which allows the bomb to explode after it has penetrated its target [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3029.5s)]
*  You're going to wait until it gets down in there before it blows up because you want to maximize the energy [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3035.9s)]
*  Every foot counts in order to get it deeper to uh to burrow down and to have the uh have the effect [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3041.34s)]
*  Since it launched its campaign against iran's nuclear program israel has damaged critical nuclear infrastructure and killed scientists [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3048.46s)]
*  Iran has denied trying to build nuclear weapons and says its nuclear program is peaceful [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3056.06s)]
*  According to the international atomic energy agency iran already has enough highly enriched uranium to make around 10 nuclear weapons [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3061.5s)]
*  Satellite images have shown damage at nuclear facilities including iran's largest enrichment facility natanz [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3070.22s)]
*  But one key location remains unscathed the fordo fuel enrichment plant where iran produces highly enriched uranium [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3077.34s)]
*  It's hidden in the mountains and is believed to be buried up to 295 feet below ground [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3085.02s)]
*  It's harder to hit deliberately. So because the iranians buried under a mountain look the u.s put norad [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3091.02s)]
*  Under shayan mountain. It's way down under a lot of granite and a lot of rock and you want to raise the threshold [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3097.5s)]
*  If your adversary is to hit something sometimes it's just really useful to bury it [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3103.9s)]
*  While israel has bunker busters, none of the ones in its arsenal are powerful enough to penetrate deep enough to hit fordo [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3107.7400000000002s)]
*  This is [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3115.02s)]
*  Why the israelis probably need u.s assistance israelis have a lot of bombs, but they need things that kind of crack the mountain [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3116.46s)]
*  Uh and and create a wedge to create the tremors and create vibrations that will be helpful to uh to destroy the facility [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3124.06s)]
*  In addition to lacking the weapons to destroy fordo israel also lacks the heavy bombers [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3132.38s)]
*  Its ally the u.s has both [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3137.58s)]
*  Fundamentally there's a choice here to be made about whether it is. Yeah fundamentally we gotta keep doing it [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3140.7799999999997s)]
*  We gotta keep doing more war, please multiple countries evacuate mid-east embassies as israel strikes another iranian nuclear facility [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3146.7799999999997s)]
*  Official confirms to fox news b2 stealth bombers appear headed from whiteman air force base in missouri who will base in [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3153.74s)]
*  Like I hate how normalized the idea of striking a nuclear facility is [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3160.54s)]
*  Yeah, this is uh one of the um [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3163.98s)]
*  At least one of the only successful aspects of of this kind of like faucet of [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3167.02s)]
*  consent manufacturing [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3173.34s)]
*  Is that it's on all fronts? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3175.1800000000003s)]
*  And the crime is so severe [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3178.1400000000003s)]
*  that [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3181.34s)]
*  You can't literally tackle every aspect of this because there's like multiple different ways of of covering this issue like [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3182.46s)]
*  No congressional approval [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3189.58s)]
*  Why are we even doing this? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3191.34s)]
*  Holy they're actually thinking about striking a nuclear facility like [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3193.34s)]
*  that is [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3197.1800000000003s)]
*  That is like third down the line at that at that point in terms of priority [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3199.1000000000004s)]
*  So no one can pay attention to all of these things most people don't pay attention to any of it at all [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3203.34s)]
*  they just basically go, I don't think we should go to war and [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3207.5s)]
*  and that when they're constantly talking about [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3211.34s)]
*  striking ford out a nuclear facility [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3215.34s)]
*  Uh as a as a given like they're not even discussing [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3219.02s)]
*  Why it should not be done and it's it's difficult to obviously address every single reason why this is insane. So you have to [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3224.2999999999997s)]
*  You have to basically [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3232.86s)]
*  focus your efforts on some of the most [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3234.86s)]
*  indefensible positions [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3238.52s)]
*  And attack them directly [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3240.94s)]
*  And [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3243.82s)]
*  when you do that, we don't even actually have a conversation about like [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3244.94s)]
*  how damaging it is that [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3249.1s)]
*  uh the the established [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3251.1s)]
*  Hidden premise here is that we're striking a nuclear facility no matter what in guam [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3253.5s)]
*  As president trump weighs possible u.s involvement in the war between israel and iran [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3258.62s)]

*  As we saw last night iran seems to prefer darkness for its dirty work [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3315.44s)]
*  Five iranian missiles were launched all were shot down by israel's anti-missile defenses [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3320.48s)]
*  This is israeli just today pummeled the isfahan nuclear facility [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3326.88s)]
*  The iaea confirms damage to the centrifuge construction facility [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3331.68s)]

*  Hamas attack against israel and the idf says it shot down [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3355.28s)]
*  What is the point of watching foxcliff's when his mostly lies and propaganda? What do you mean? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3359.76s)]
*  Do you not want to know what your fellow americans are getting beamed into their minds directly also? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3364.96s)]
*  There's the the reason why we watch fox news here is twofold one [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3370.8s)]
*  Because you need to understand what the right wing believes because they will literally spit this out hook line a sinker [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3375.1200000000003s)]
*  And number two I use it as an opportunity to show you how how similar [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3381.36s)]
*  The coverage is on the fox news front as opposed to the coverage on the cnn front [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3386.6400000000003s)]
*  that's why [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3392.2400000000002s)]
*  One video from fox news one video from the wall street journal one video from fox news one video from cnn [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3393.6800000000003s)]

*  Invested in the exact same ambition going to war [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taiyD-j1oo&t=3406.7999999999997s)]
