# The Immigrant Battle Between Vance And Kamala Heats Up | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo)
*  If you plan to deport them, how would you do that legally? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=0.0s)]
*  Dude, the media should have been asking these questions like for months at this point. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=3.36s)]
*  And the Democratic Party is... the Democratic Party is absolutely a fall for this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=8.0s)]
*  Kamala confirmed chatter. You said this word for word last week about the logistics of mass deportations. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=17.6s)]
*  Guys, I'm not a brilliant political tactician, okay? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=23.2s)]
*  I'm a normal person who sees what the fuck is going on and has like a conscious, okay? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=26.96s)]
*  What she's doing here, verbatim, what I've said she should be doing for a very long time now [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=33.52s)]
*  is the bare minimum that I am shocked that they didn't get to already, okay? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=41.44s)]
*  Fall back on being a dumbass quick. What? I mean, first of all, this is a moment where I should be [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=46.64s)]
*  the gift of prophecy. Like, call me Apollo, not calling myself a dumbass. The reason why I'm saying [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=53.04s)]
*  that is because even as a dumbass, okay, I can see certain things that are going on and be like, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  why won't she communicate conscience? Sorry, not conscience. It's just common sense. But yeah, here, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=67.2s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday criticized the Republican. Donald Trump's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=73.68s)]
*  promises to deport millions of people who are in the United States illegally questioning [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=76.48s)]
*  whether he would rely on massive raids and detention camps to carry it out. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=79.92s)]
*  Harris, the presidential nominee, told the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=84.4s)]
*  annual leadership Congress that the nation can find both a pathway to citizenship for those who [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=88.64s)]
*  want to come and at the same time secure the border. We can do both and we must do both, she said. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=93.76s)]
*  Trump, for his part, was heading to Uniondale in New York's Long Island as both candidates took a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=99.04s)]
*  break Wednesday from campaigning. Harris harked back at the Trump administration's immigration [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=103.36s)]
*  policies as she bid for Hispanic support. While we fight to move our nation forward to a brighter [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=107.12s)]
*  future, Donald Trump and his extremist allies will keep trying to pull us backwards. Harris said, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  we all remember what they did to thank God. We all remember what they did to tear families apart. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=115.92s)]
*  And now they have pledged to carry out the largest deportation, a mass deportation in American [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  history. Imagine what that would look like and what that would be. How's that going to happen? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  Massive raids, massive. Okay. This is verbatim what I've said on stream, like a thousand times [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=132.0s)]
*  over. I get it. Okay. Now I know why. Now I know why chatters are, are, were saying what they were [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=137.12s)]
*  saying earlier. Okay. Massive raids, massive detention camps. What are they talking about? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=142.56s)]
*  She said her staff was finally caught up on the, caught up on the VODs. Meanwhile, this is what [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=146.88s)]
*  JD Vance is doing. Hi, Senator. Me and McCarthy with Politico. Question for you about the Haitian [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=153.6s)]
*  migrants in Springfield. So I know you've talked a lot about how we need to deport illegal aliens, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=160.4s)]
*  but I wanted to ask you, the majority of the Haitians in Springfield came under TPS. So they [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=166.4s)]
*  are here legally. And I know you've expressed a lot of your issues with the TPS program and wanting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=172.16s)]
*  to change that under a Trump Vance administration. But I guess my question for you is if you become [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=177.28s)]
*  the vice president under a Trump administration, what will you guys do about the migrants that are [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=184.16s)]
*  already there since they did arrive legally? And a follow up to that, if you plan to deport them, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=189.04s)]
*  how would you do that legally? Dude, the media should have been asking these questions like [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=195.6s)]
*  for months at this point. And the democratic party is the democratic party is absolutely a fall for [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=200.64s)]
*  this. Yeah. 54% of Americans back mass deportation of immigrants. It was higher than that like two [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=206.16s)]
*  months ago, by the way. Okay. 54% of respondents, 86% of Republicans, 58% of independents and 25% [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  of Democrats said they strongly or somewhat support a wide scale effort to deport millions [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=218.24s)]
*  of immigrants. And 59% said they are closely following the immigration situation at the US [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  Mexico border. They're not. Okay, it used to be 60%. Now it's down to 54%. Now I need you to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  understand something. Okay. People look at this poll and go, Oh my god, America is so and to a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  certain degree. Yes, you're right. America is very, but what you also fail to consider is that these [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=241.44s)]
*  guys, once again, have no instead, the democrats have personally launched their own right wing [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=247.2s)]
*  white nativist anti immigrant sentiment in the form of legislation. Okay, Democrats have adopted [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=254.88s)]
*  the right wing framing on the matter, which was always insane. I fear that Kamala Harris is far [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=260.96s)]
*  too late to the game. And you know, switching her trajectory now. And I don't know if there's going [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=267.52s)]
*  to be enough enough time for her to adequately craft a narrative around it, especially when it'll [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=273.92s)]
*  be called in the question, like her, her, her policy prescriptions will be called in the question, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=280.24s)]
*  a really phenomenal time to do this would have been during the debate, because, and I've been [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  saying this quite a bit as well, especially recently with the Haitian immigrant stuff. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  One of the aspects of how frustrating the Trump administration was for average Americans was the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  reality that Trump greatly accelerated galvanized emboldened some of the biggest dumbasses in our [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=301.44s)]
*  country. Okay, that is a massive, massive motivator to get people to go out and vote [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=307.36s)]
*  against Donald Trump. Like it is not just a, it is not, it's not an issue that causes like [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=314.4s)]
*  significant material harm, okay, to advocate for to advocate against the the Republican Party's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=320.88s)]
*  like endless blood libel against migrants is already both the morally correct position. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=327.68s)]
*  And also beyond that, a smart political position to take as well. But beyond that, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=335.44s)]
*  just to simply remind people one of the most significant aspects of the Trump administration [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=342.72s)]
*  from the the from the eyes of like the median voter that doesn't really like to pay attention [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=348.48s)]
*  to issues at all, okay, is emboldening the dumbest people in society into feeling like [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=353.76s)]
*  their opinion is worth a damn. Do you see what I'm saying? That was an incredibly stupid time. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=360.56s)]
*  People were just like straight up dying from COVID and still denying its existence on their [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=366.88s)]
*  deathbeds. People were getting separated from their children and being placed into concentration [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  camps at the border. And the defenders of this unimaginably cruel policy were outwardly being [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=379.2s)]
*  like, nah, they deserve it, brother, shut up Europe. Remember how that felt? If you can't think about [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=387.2s)]
*  the the abject cruelty on its own as a standalone problem, then think about how that made you feel. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  Think about how angry and resentful that made you feel that is absolutely a phenomenal anti-Trump [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=400.64s)]
*  message that she can run on to be like, see, remember this Haitian migrant? It is basically [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=409.12s)]
*  a callback to all of the times that the republicans lied about a multitude of different issues, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=413.76s)]
*  and had their followers chirp and repeat those ridiculous lies. That's it. Well, look, this is, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=420.4s)]
*  this is a media and Kamala Harris fact check that I want to I want to clarify and clear up right now. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=427.92s)]
*  And here's now the media loves to say that the Haitian migrants, hundreds of thousands of them, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  by the way, 20,000 in Springfield, but hundreds of thousands of them all across the country, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  they are here legally. And what they mean, they are the Kamala Harris use two separate programs, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  mass. They are though, you're just you just don't want them to be here legally. Like whether you [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  recognize that they're here legally or not doesn't change the reality that they are here legally. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  You just want to make them illegal. You want to believe that they're illegal. That, by the way, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  that right there is actually the truth, which is the difference between an undocumented migrant [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=467.2s)]
*  and a documented migrant is paper. Okay, that's it. This is the the other side of that reality. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=472.4s)]
*  And it gets scary when you think about it from the from the framework of the republicans, where [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=479.84s)]
*  they're like, well, they're here legally, but it doesn't matter. I still think they're illegal. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=483.52s)]
*  And I will take away their paperwork versus what I say, which is they're here legally. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=487.52s)]
*  And the people here who are illegal could be made to be legal migrants, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  parole and temporary protective status. She used two programs to wave a wand and to say, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  we're not going to deport those people here. Well, if Kamala Harris waves the wand [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=503.44s)]
*  illegally and says these people are now here legally, I'm still going to call them an illegal [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=507.76s)]
*  alien and illegal action from calm. I just want to point to something here, two different things [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  that I want to fucking mention. One, Trump blocks Venezuelans deportation and last political gift. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=516.56s)]
*  Two, Trump grants Venezuelans temporary legal status on his way out. Okay, just understand that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  like a lot of the Venezuelans that came here came here directly as a consequence of of Donald Trump's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=528.88s)]
*  crippling sanctions on Venezuela. Okay, and not only that, not only that, but also he granted them [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=534.7199999999999s)]
*  I think part of the reason why they're hitting the Haitian stuff instead of the Venezuelan stuff [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=542.72s)]
*  any longer is because obviously Trump granted Venezuelans TPS, okay, temporary protective status, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=547.12s)]
*  the legal framework for them to exist in inside of the US boundaries without any additional [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  scrutiny. Okay, but he did also end TPS for Haitians. So now he can say, you know, we're anti, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=560.32s)]
*  we didn't do the Haitian thing. Kamala Harris did. Having said that, however, there were already [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=568.64s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Haitians with TPS, temporary protective status living inside of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  the US borders. And they continued under the they continue to receive an extension on their temporary [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  protective status under the Trump administration as well. Here it is Haiti was initially designated [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  on the basis of extraordinary and temporary conditions in Haiti that prevented nationals [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  of Haiti from returning in safely. Following the initial designation TPS for Haiti was extended [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=594.96s)]
*  and re designated once from July 23 2011 through January 22 2013 based on the extraordinary and [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=599.84s)]
*  temporary conditions. Thereafter TPS for Haiti was extended four times based on extraordinary [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=606.0s)]
*  and temporary conditions. 23 2013 2014 2014 to 2016 2016 to 2017 and from 2017 to 2018. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=612.08s)]
*  Subsequently, the Secretary announced the termination of the TPS designation of Haiti effective [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=624.4s)]
*  on 2019. So Trump both extended the TPS status to Haitian migrants, and then revoked it. Okay, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=630.16s)]
*  he did. But this has been an ongoing this has been an ongoing temporary immigration status that has [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=638.4s)]
*  been afforded to victims of major conflicts for for a very long time. Okay, it's not new. And Trump [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=644.8s)]
*  did this as well. Trump also happened to take away the TPS status of Haitians, for the record. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=653.68s)]
*  But once again, he definitely did not do so for Venezuelans. Okay. So when these talk about the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=659.5999999999999s)]
*  magic wand, what they fail to mention or what they fail to acknowledge is that they've also [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=665.52s)]
*  waved that magic wand. Okay. Amala Harris does not make an alien legal. That is not how this works. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=672.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, shut the fuck up. Anyway, here the democrats are changing their message a little bit. Finally, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  going back to the old school Democratic Party, which was still not good enough, but at least it [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=683.12s)]
*  wasn't like overtly and also completely captured by right wing interests. Let me be clear. We believe [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=688.0s)]
*  in an immigration system that reflects our values. We don't demonize immigrants. We don't single them [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=694.48s)]
*  out for attacks. We don't believe they're poisoning the blood of the country. We're a nation of [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=701.68s)]
*  immigrants. And that's why we're so damn strong. It shouldn't have taken them to get to this point. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=706.48s)]
*  Only after like Republicans try to do pogroms in Springfield, Ohio by doing blood libel on Haitian [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=712.72s)]
*  immigrants. Okay. It's ridiculous. Like Republicans are going full Nazi on the timeline and the dumb [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=718.96s)]
*  ass Democrats only now are like, yeah, you know what, maybe we should say something about this. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=725.44s)]
*  Anyway, that's the reason why I'm riding with Biden though, because he's brave enough to say [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=730.32s)]
*  these truth truthful things like America's nation immigrants. Like you said, they're finally taking [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=733.6s)]
*  advantage of this as a campaigning opportunity. I know it's so insane that it has taken this long. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=738.72s)]
*  It's so goddamn frustrating. Anyway, I'm riding with Biden because he didn't. Now they have pledged [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  to carry out the largest deportation, a mass deportation in American history. Imagine what [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=749.52s)]
*  that would look like and what that would be. I'm Donald Trump and I approve. Okay, dude. One of the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=756.4s)]
*  funniest things is yeah, we got liberals going. Your best fit is ambivalent, right? Along with [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=762.32s)]
*  12% of the public shocked to find out shocked to find out that a Kamala Harris supporter is [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=768.88s)]
*  ambivalent. Right? Anyway, these poll results about respondents saying that they would love for mass [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  deportations to happen in this country are correct. It's a correct snapshot that reflects [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=782.6400000000001s)]
*  how far right we've moved on this issue. But these polls can change and they do change. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  And the only way they change is either a if the Democrats launch launch launch successful counter [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=796.0s)]
*  messaging against this. Okay. As I've been begging for them to do so for months, for years, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=802.72s)]
*  and especially so in the last couple of months. And then beyond the successful counter messaging, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=810.24s)]
*  the alternative is once these policies are implemented, once these policies are implemented, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=816.4s)]
*  only then do Americans recognize the cruelty of such policies and the devastating impact that such [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=823.92s)]
*  policies might have in the economy in general. That's the problem. A lot of these dumb, including [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=830.56s)]
*  liberals, including centrists, including independence, don't actually think about the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=836.72s)]
*  outcome. They just hear something. They hear it over and over again. They think to themselves, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=842.32s)]
*  Oh my god, immigrants are doing insane, I believe. And it's not like the Democrats are saying the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  opposite. So I'm willing to believe that myself, that immigrants are doing massive. Okay. And then [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  they see the polls, especially after they see the polls of like 62% of the public saying like they [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=861.12s)]
*  want mass deportations. There is no counter messaging for it whatsoever. Right? They go along with it [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=865.5200000000001s)]
*  out of the fear that they have the fear that like, Oh, people really want this really ends [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=871.92s)]
*  up happening. And only then people go, Oh, maybe it wasn't such a good idea. This happened under [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=876.56s)]
*  Trump. As well. This literally happened in between the timeframe in 2016 and 2020. People [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=882.24s)]
*  genuinely despise Donald Trump's immigration policies. Okay, why did they despise it? Because [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=891.52s)]
*  they were separating children from their family members at the border. And then using those [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=898.8s)]
*  children as a honeypot to catch additional migrants. They were doing drag nets, they were [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=904.7199999999999s)]
*  doing mass deportations. And the Democrats, because they weren't in no position of power, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=909.76s)]
*  were behaving like the little radicals they are when they're far removed from power. Okay, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=916.3199999999999s)]
*  all of the independent thinkers that love watching American TV, and love, you know, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=921.76s)]
*  paying close attention to politics in general, are just bots that repeat whatever television man [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  tells them they do not think on their own about the impact of such policies. They do not think on [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  their own about like, the veracity of the claims being made on television about migrants, especially [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=942.2399999999999s)]
*  when there is no one on the other side of the duopoly saying, Where are you getting this [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=951.12s)]
*  migrants from dumbass? You just made it the up. You made it up because they did. They hyper focus [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=955.6s)]
*  on anecdotes. And those are very emotional. Those are very emotionally charged anecdotes. And the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=962.4s)]
*  Democrats are too scared to oppose it. They can't just be like, Dude, what are you talking about? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=969.36s)]
*  20,000 homicides occurred on US soil, you're talking about 24 homicides? Are you insane? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  We actually want to curb back homicides. You very clearly don't give about it. You just the only [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=981.28s)]
*  thing it seems to me the only thing you don't like about the homicides is that it's not a natural [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=987.92s)]
*  born US citizen doing it. Okay, that's the only time it seems to be in the wrong. Republicans [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=993.04s)]
*  only care about or when it's a non American doing it clearly. And when that's not enough, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=999.2s)]
*  when they still want to push the needle further, they just start making extra up like, Oh, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1005.6800000000001s)]
*  they're eating your cats and dogs. They're eating your pets is crazy. These are the very same people [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1010.88s)]
*  have pulled would also in without even a shred of like without even a shred of recognition for the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1017.12s)]
*  irony would say they are for mass amnesty. Okay, I'm letting you know right now I know for a fact [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1023.12s)]
*  that if you were to ask every single one of these people, do you think there should be a pathway to [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1032.08s)]
*  citizenship for people who have, you know, been inside of the US borders for however many years, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1036.88s)]
*  as long as they have a have no background, they would say absolutely and they do they pulled [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1044.24s)]
*  this and you see it in the anecdotes as well. You see this in the anecdotes like there will be [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1053.44s)]
*  Trump supporters are like, Yeah, my mom is undocumented. Build the wall. But also my mom [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1058.64s)]
*  should be allowed inside the wall and become a, you know, become a citizen. It's like, Okay, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1064.88s)]
*  that's weird. Why did you just what like those two things are at odds with one another. But okay, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1070.24s)]
*  anyway, some of the consider what what did you say about this? I didn't see vids in your highlight [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1076.48s)]
*  channel. And what do you mean? I did. I did cover it when it happened. It's not that big of a deal. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1081.68s)]
*  It's only not that big of a deal that Richard Lowry said the n word because he basically writes [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1088.0s)]
*  it out in every article that he writes without actually saying the n word. Okay. That's the reason [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1093.84s)]
*  why you probably didn't see a highlight even though I did cover it. It would be a bigger deal to me at [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1100.0s)]
*  least. It would be a bigger deal to me at least if he wasn't saying it to Springfield residents calling [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1105.36s)]

*  we would have we would need a force so powerful that it must be extraterrestrial because China [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1217.2800000000002s)]

*  by making it more like Haiti? When you look at Haiti, what part of Haiti are you saying to [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1249.04s)]

*  to them. And then Americans revolt against it. And then the alien colony is so powerful that they [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1326.96s)]
*  literally go, okay, you know what, you have a bunch of our people, but like, you still have to pay us [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1332.56s)]

*  no one else in all of our other planets that we've colonized, you know, learn the lessons that of the [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1352.4s)]

*  to keep them docile and, and, you know, destroy their country every couple of years so that like [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1364.56s)]
*  other, other humans don't actually look at that and go, Ooh, that's successful. We should do that [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1371.76s)]
*  here ourselves. But also at a certain, we wouldn't want that. No, yes, we wouldn't want that. But I [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1376.32s)]
*  would also say that, that, that's not entirely why Haiti's in the position that it's in. I mean, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1380.56s)]
*  at a certain point as a country, you have to, Oh, he's going to do the classic like, well, you know, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1385.36s)]
*  this is, this is the classic American position. It's like, well, slavery was abolished. So why [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1390.6399999999999s)]
*  are black people still poor? Okay. Move on Haitian revolution happen. And all the things that you [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1397.04s)]
*  just described post Haitian revolution. Well, you know, that's inconsequential to stand on your own [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1404.6399999999999s)]
*  two feet and take care of yourself. And what point is that? That let's they, they elect, they elect [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1412.3999999999999s)]
*  Aristide and we overthrow Aristide and they elect Jovan El Moise. Jovan El Moise is assassinated a [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1417.76s)]
*  bunch of, a bunch of people with American connections. And then we install in 2021, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1422.48s)]
*  like the United States installed the prime minister that we just ousted. Like, so we can say, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1428.96s)]
*  okay, yeah, you got to get over the, you know, 200 years ago, but like, we're still doing it. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1434.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, and I'm not in favor of, I'm, I'm very non interventionist in my policy. So I'm not [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1438.72s)]
*  in favor of the things that we're doing in other countries. We just made the new government in Haiti [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1444.72s)]
*  in a hotel room in Jamaica. And then we insisted that whatever government we made in Jamaica had [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1450.16s)]
*  to allow Kenyan police, Kenyan troops to come in under the flag of the UN in order to go to war [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1455.92s)]
*  with the gangs. Yeah. I'm not, look, I'm not interested in, if it were up to me, I'm not [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1463.04s)]
*  interested in doing anything. Hey, like, like what Haiti be Haiti and take care of that. That's sort [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1467.2s)]
*  of my, my whole point here. No, you're not because you're using what we have done in terms of, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1470.56s)]
*  in terms of destabilizing Haiti as a way while avoiding that as a way to say like, well, black [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1479.12s)]
*  people don't know how to run. Like that's the, that's the point that you made a point that [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1486.08s)]
*  requires everyone listening to not know anything about Haiti, which is fine because most people [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1490.48s)]
*  don't know anything about Haiti. That's the whole point. That's the reason why people get away with [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1495.6799999999998s)]
*  saying like insanely on a regular basis. Let them take care of themselves and their own problems. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1499.68s)]
*  I'm also not saying that there's like never a scenario where we let someone from Haiti into [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1503.28s)]
*  the country. But it doesn't have to just be about Haiti, but when you're throwing open the gates [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1507.44s)]
*  and just inviting anyone in particular, you know, I guess your assumption there was that it is the [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1513.76s)]
*  United States is largely responsible for a lot of issues in Haiti though. But of course, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1520.88s)]
*  a conservative would never recognize that you're wrong. Conservatives have recognized that and will [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1524.32s)]
*  continue to recognize that. That's the other part of the problem. You want to know why [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1530.8s)]
*  conservatives do recognize that as a simple talking point without ever thinking about it beyond that [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1535.52s)]
*  because the Clintons played a prominent role in up Haiti. Here is Donald Trump during the third [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1540.32s)]
*  presidential debate in 2016, telling Hillary this and you take a look at the people of Haiti. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1546.8s)]
*  I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1554.24s)]
*  because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton foundation is a disgrace. And you know it and they [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1560.08s)]
*  know it. And everybody knows Secretary Clinton very quickly. We look at that as a simple talking [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1566.8s)]
*  point. They know how to deploy that real easy. Okay. They hate the Clinton. So they're like, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1572.32s)]
*  yeah, Clinton sub Haiti, Haitian people that are creating the conditions on Haiti. And then if the [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1576.72s)]
*  Haitian people come to Springfield, they will recreate the conditions in Springfield. Whereas [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  what I'm saying is that it's actually the US that has largely, I was gone for a bit. Did you see [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1588.72s)]
*  this JD Vans light again? Oh yeah. I did see this earlier today. I forgot that I forgot to cover it. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1594.48s)]
*  Why we need professional journalists. JD Vance rep tells Wall Street Journal about Anna Kilgore, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1602.0s)]
*  a Springfield, Ohio woman whose cat went missing in August. So Chris Mar from Wall Street Journal, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1607.76s)]
*  Pittsburgh based Wall Street Journal reporter drives to her house. She found the cat in her [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1614.0800000000002s)]
*  basement and apologized to her Haitian neighbors. A vast spokesperson on Tuesday provided the [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1619.52s)]
*  Wall Street Journal with a police report in which the resident had claimed her pet might have been [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1624.8000000000002s)]

*  Miss Sassy, which went missing in late August had actually returned a few days later, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1633.6s)]
*  found safe in her own basement. Kilgore wearing a Trump shirt and hat said she apologized to her [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1637.4399999999998s)]

*  give a how old this lady is. She needs to go and work on the land. Okay. She needs to toil the land [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1649.04s)]
*  for at least a year. Do you understand? This is my solution. Send her to the camp, send her to work [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1658.96s)]
*  the goddamn fields, reeducate her, teach her poetry, teach her the arts in the process. Okay. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1668.24s)]
*  That's it. This is after a week of coverage by major media. They're more complicit in this than [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1676.56s)]
*  this women. They ran with a lie and let the liar repeated over and over again. For sure. I agree. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1680.3999999999999s)]
*  And you know, I agree. I've been yelling about this and how to stop, but also think about sending [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1686.32s)]
*  her to the camp. Like reeducation is a necessity at this point. You know what I mean? Think about [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1691.52s)]
*  how sick that would be. Oh, my God. Ended a ride along with some Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1696.6399999999999s)]
*  getting picked up early morning for work. This van gets those that don't have transportation [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1701.28s)]
*  to jobs. Part of why Haitians are settling in Springfield because demand for work is high. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1705.68s)]
*  Haitian workers piled in on their way to their factory job in a nearby town. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1709.2s)]
*  This will be our seventh pickup. We pull up. They're sitting on the porch, ready to go. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1714.16s)]
*  The company that organizes these vans says the demand for workers is high. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1718.48s)]
*  Maybe just the first education. Yeah, that's what I mean. Reeducation is education. Okay. Everybody [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1722.72s)]
*  gets weirded out when I say those words, but honestly, like I just mean rehabilitation. Okay. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1728.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm using spicy language surrounding it, but like these people need education. Like they actually do. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1734.96s)]
*  They do. They need rehabilitation. They need education. They need to be normal, productive [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1741.44s)]
*  members of society again. They are completely checked out. Okay. Many just don't have a way to [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1746.72s)]
*  get to work. The president estimates most of their business comes from Haitian immigrants. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1753.28s)]
*  At this point, we are probably a 60 40 split. They add a great benefit to our workforce. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1758.4s)]
*  These hopeful workers showed up just as the doors opened Tuesday. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1764.88s)]
*  We're averaging 18 to 25 people a day. And that's people looking for new jobs? Yes. People that are [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1773.3600000000001s)]

*  Wilson Dorsonville was a doctor in Haiti. He says he fled because he was going to be kidnapped. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=1786.96s)]

*  Springfield, which had been declining in population. The city now estimates 12 to 15,000 immigrants, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2068.48s)]
*  many if not most of them Haitians, call Springfield home. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2074.88s)]
*  We are hard worker, and we are paying a lot of taxes. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2078.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. All to try and make Springfield better. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2081.84s)]
*  Better. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2085.6800000000003s)]
*  And while the 33% increase in taxable revenue since last year, by the way, due to all these [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2086.1600000000003s)]
*  markers working. Do these people calling in fake threats get in trouble? I never see a mention in [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2091.92s)]
*  major media. Not enough. I think they just, I think they often use like, you know, different [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2096.4s)]
*  methods readily available at their disposal, like Google phone numbers and like that. Like [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2104.88s)]
*  there are untraceable means of doing such things. And even if it's not a direct call, it's just like [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2110.7200000000003s)]
*  people make sock accounts. People either make sock accounts, like fake emails that make it hard to [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2116.08s)]
*  trace. The influx has boosted the local economy, city officials say. It's also strained resources. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2122.8s)]
*  People are getting really fed up. It's been a major topic of conversation. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2129.28s)]
*  We feel like people are acting based on fear, panicking. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2133.52s)]
*  That's the craziest part is that like they're openly saying their resources are strained. And [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2137.6s)]
*  it's like, you should be yelling at JD Vance every day, dog. Like it's not your Haitian neighbor [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2141.84s)]
*  that is the problem here. You understand? It's your goddamn senator and your local officials that are [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2149.04s)]
*  not like adequately funding these already crippled resources. And the Haitian community itself, it's [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2154.24s)]
*  confusion, including around opportunities with those jobs being open, you know, whose job is to [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2160.96s)]
*  take an open job. The added tensions in recent days, though, has taken a toll. I was feeling [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2166.8s)]
*  a little bit feel better right now. My teachers, coworkers, friends, they reach out to me somehow. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2173.6s)]
*  A lot of people ask, by the way, how do you counter message against that? This is how you do it. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2181.36s)]
*  Okay, you show an example like anecdotes are very powerful. Anecdotes are very powerful. If you don't [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2186.24s)]
*  just like want to parse through the data and you consider that to be boring, then show an anecdote [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2192.32s)]
*  that is positive. Get a guy like positive as in like his situation is still horrific. But like, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2197.2s)]
*  you know, get a guy who's a doctor in Haiti coming here and working or trying to work as a nurse. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2202.8s)]
*  Like that's a that's the way to do it. Show that these are real people. I can't believe I'm saying [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2210.0s)]
*  this like just humanized immigrants, please is a crazy position that I have found myself advocating [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2214.88s)]
*  for. Like it's it's wild asking me. How are you holding up? Okay, we love you. We need you here. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2222.0s)]
*  You still see Springfield is a beautiful place. It is. He balances his new life with his old one, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2229.28s)]
*  dreaming of uniting them both. Sometimes they call me and there is a lot of shooting in the [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2235.6800000000003s)]
*  neighborhood. The best way to get them right here in the United States, it's through the school [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2241.2s)]
*  process because after graduation, you can like apply to get a green card through this. I can get [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2248.72s)]
*  them. Now outside of even the recent politics here, I mentioned the strain on resources. We have seen [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2256.72s)]
*  that pop up in various aspects. For example, the state announced new resources for primary health [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2265.6s)]
*  care because those that may be arriving here might not have had the best health care to that point, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2270.48s)]
*  but also adding state patrol resources to local law enforcement to assist in what they've say [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2274.88s)]
*  they say has been an increase in dangerous driving. Specifically, they pinpointed to [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2280.64s)]
*  inexperienced Haitian drivers and all others who disregard the law. So there are pressure [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2285.6s)]
*  points within this community that have been tested again well before. I hate cops dude. Every [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2291.12s)]
*  situation they got to get a bag. Every situation like they always got to get a bag every situation. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2297.12s)]
*  Yeah, all this stuff is, you know, the Haitians are fine, but also they're horrible drivers and [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2305.92s)]
*  we need more resources. Yeah, let's not fund the DMV, you know, offer driving course or anything. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2311.52s)]
*  We need cops. That's what we need. We need more. We need more cops, no public transit. Okay. Cops [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2319.68s)]
*  is what we need. I'm sorry that the rows have potholes. Cop will fix it. Oh, did the traffic [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2326.32s)]
*  lights not work? Cops will fix it. Give more money to the cops. I promise. Please, please a little bit [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2331.92s)]
*  more funding, sir. Sir, we need a little bit more funding. Please, please, please. Let's look at [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2337.76s)]
*  Springfield, Ohio police budget. I want to know. I want to know. I want to see something. Oh, Clark [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2343.44s)]
*  County approves more than 200 million in the 2024 budget. Clark County has approved the 233.9 [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2349.52s)]

*  million that will go to Clark County Sheriff's office up from 19 million last year. The sheriff's [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2379.84s)]
*  office regularly has the highest expense with it running several agencies, including the Clark [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2385.2s)]
*  County jail emergency management agency received about 1 million. By the way, did I know that ahead [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2391.52s)]
*  of time? No, I speculated. I happened to be correct. Why? Because this is the reality in every town. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2397.76s)]
*  This is the reality in every city. This is the reality in the United States of America. Okay. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2406.0s)]
*  This is the exact same thing in every locality, township, municipality, state, large city. Police [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2412.5600000000004s)]
*  take up the largest chunk of the budget. And then beyond that, beyond the regular operational costs [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2421.92s)]
*  that are always increasing, police also are a strain on resources because they constantly beat [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2429.2000000000003s)]
*  the people and they constantly people and then they have to pay civil litigation fees. That's the [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2436.2400000000002s)]
*  other side of the process. Yep. See what Pharrell Williams said? What did he say? I'm Israel high. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2443.28s)]
*  Just kidding. I know what he said. He said, Ooh, popular, popular artists should just shut [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2450.0s)]
*  them up about politics. I never talk about politics unless I'm raising $60 million with the IDF. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2455.12s)]
*  Okay. There you go. That's what I think about Pharrell Williams. You can suck my [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2461.84s)]

*  None of them are being forced to come here. They all heard from someone else, another Haitian that [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2477.2s)]
*  was here previously, that this was a good place to live. And that has been a major portion of why [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2482.24s)]
*  they've ended up being here. And the city has also come out and said, no one is, bro, you seriously [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2487.44s)]
*  want Pharrell to call you out? He's not going to hear me say this. Okay. And even if he did call me [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2492.56s)]

*  wanted in this community again, well before all of these politics got involved over the last few [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2505.84s)]
*  weeks. Anyway, all right. All right. All right. What else is on the docket? I'm skipping the [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgOBNOgQBo&t=2510.1600000000003s)]
