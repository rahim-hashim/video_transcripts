**HasanAbi:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI)
*  He ran in 2021 telling New Yorkers that they didn't have to choose between safety or justice. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=0.0s)]
*  And there was a large constituency that voted for him that was in put mouth noises on it [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=4.96s)]
*  too. You're so nasty with the boomer. Anyway, Zoran seems like such a jam. I hope he wins [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=9.42s)]
*  and you can celebrate with him. I hope so too. Anyway, I had a Bangladeshi food, which [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=14.48s)]
*  was incredible. Excellent. Personal news time. Ended the broadcast last night. No more fit [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=21.48s)]
*  checks, dude. It's one day. It's one day. Calm down. Okay. Yeah. I didn't post a fit [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=34.08s)]
*  check today. I just got off the goddamn plane. I'm on like two and a half hours of sleep [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=40.04s)]
*  barely. And you're like, wow, I can't believe it. And do a fit check today. Yeah, I didn't. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=45.2s)]
*  You'll be fine. You'll, you'll be okay. Anyway, listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=50.199999999999996s)]
*  As you guys know, maybe some of you weren't in here because your weekend warriors and you're [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=58.28s)]
*  not at work. So you don't watch me and you only watch me at work. But this weekend, I flew to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=63.64s)]
*  Washington DC. And then I flew to New York City, the Istanbul of America [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=71.96s)]
*  under the rulership and the protectorate of Eric Adams. That's right. I went to DC to speak at [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  a Palestinian demonstration. Then I flew to New York City from DC to link up with Zoram [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=90.44s)]
*  Donnie. It was fantastic. Hopefully that that video will be out soon. I suspect, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=99.16s)]
*  you know, spent a day with the next mayor of New York type beat, you know, no fit check day. They [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=106.68s)]
*  will live in infamy. We never forget. Okay. Well, you will forget. How are you not tired, bro? Are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=112.12s)]
*  you good? I am tired. Of course I'm tired. It's impossible for me not to be tired. How would I not? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=116.76s)]
*  What do you mean? I'm tired. That story is goaded. Yes. I'm a big fan of Queens now, actually. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=122.92s)]
*  Queens was sick. So I got was Zoram. I'm Donnie for like three hours. We just went through the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=129.0s)]
*  streets, the main streets of Astoria. And it was amazing. It was an amazing experience. I ate so [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=137.32s)]
*  many donuts. Here's a, here's a fun little clip from, yeah. Boomer about what it, what it looked [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=143.24s)]
*  like, at least in the beginning, as you walk in the door and how do you grow that? No, it's a great [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=149.64s)]
*  question. And, and it speaks to our commitment to not just win the race, but to build a coalition [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=157.08s)]
*  that can go. And it's easy to look at Eric Adams now and see him as a caricature of a Republican [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  cop and forget how he ran in 2021. He ran in 2021 telling New Yorkers that they didn't have to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  choose between safety or justice. And there was a large constituency that voted for him. That was [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  put mouth noises on it too. You're so nasty with the boomer. Anyway, Zoran seems like such a jam. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=180.28s)]
*  I hope he wins and you can celebrate with him. I hope so too. Anyway, I had a Bangladeshi food, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=186.28s)]
*  which was incredible. Excellent. This was a real cultural exchange. You know, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=193.56s)]
*  we linked up. We have some, we met, we met a bunch of aunts and aunties from Bangladesh [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=201.64s)]
*  and we had some Yemeni coffee, some Yemeni tea. It was incredible stuff. It was, it was fantastic. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=209.08s)]
*  And Zoran is a really, really spectacular individual. Met a lot of you guys over the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=216.6s)]
*  weekend. That was also fun. I feel like maybe I wasn't, I hope I didn't come across like short [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=222.6s)]
*  or angry. I was a little tired. I hope that, that, you know, people that met me didn't feel like [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=230.44s)]
*  damn sky's a real asshole, but something I worry about, but it is because I was just, you know, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=236.68s)]
*  I was pumping, I was pumping. I was a nonstop pumping anyway, after the, after I ended the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=243.64s)]
*  broadcast, this is part of the broadcast where I tell you about my subtle sponsor, ha ha clean. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=249.0s)]
*  No, it's not a sponsor. That's so annoying that everyone thinks this is a sponsor. God damn it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=254.44s)]
*  They got free. They got so much free ads off of that. Yeah. I ended the broadcast yesterday. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=258.52s)]
*  Wait, what happened? What is my mic fine? Hello. Hello. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=265.4s)]
*  Okay. Mike degradation glitch. It's fine. Now is it fine now? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  Anyway, as I was saying, as I was saying, so wait, it's back. What the fuck is going on? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=282.44s)]
*  What is happening? I don't understand. Why is this happening? It keeps happening randomly. Wait, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=290.76s)]
*  let me hear what this sounds like. All right. Into the broadcast. This is part of the broadcast [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=298.28s)]
*  where I tell you about my personal news. So, oh, that's weird. What is happening? Sounds like [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=301.8s)]
*  your cables. I don't think it's my cable. Is it happening again? Is it, is it still going on? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=307.8s)]
*  I just unplugged the dude. What the fuck, man? It's a bit random. It's not a cable. It's a digital [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=314.2s)]
*  artifact sound, something in the software. Oh, I just got back home. Why are there issues, man? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=319.64s)]
*  Why are there issues? Nvidia glitch. It's the new drivers. Okay. Well, it's going to happen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=328.04s)]
*  It's going to happen today until I fix it, but I'm not going to be able to actually change this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  situation unless it becomes like really, really annoying. Everybody always has like wonderful [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=342.04s)]
*  suggestions. Like, Hey man, just reset your audio interface, restart your computer. It's like, I just [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=347.24s)]
*  started streaming big dog. I can't do any of those things. Okay. Calm down. All right. It might happen [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=351.56s)]
*  a little bit. All right. All right. All right. All right. Stock market's crashing. My computer [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=356.52s)]
*  is crashing. Apparently everything is crashing. But as I was saying, and the broadcast last night [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  hung out with some, some friends in New York, saw all the boys or at least all of the boys that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  could make it brace Noah, Dylan, Dylan Saba, Adam Felix. It was great. I brought Lolo there too. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  I hung out with them a little bit and yeah, it was, it was a great time, great combos. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=386.76s)]
*  And I didn't sleep. I didn't sleep at all. After that, we spoke, we hung out like late into the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=395.08s)]
*  night. We hung out late into the night. Then I couldn't really sleep at that point because of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=400.52s)]
*  the coffee that Zoram maybe drink at 9 PM because I'm a baby. I usually don't, I usually [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=407.96s)]
*  don't drink coffee after like six PM. Like I try not to drink anything caffeinated after like six PM. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  But since I was drinking coffee at like 9 PM and then tea at 9 PM, it just like cooked me and I [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=423.64s)]
*  couldn't sleep. So I just, what did it happen again? Robot voice again. Oh yeah. That's so [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=429.64s)]
*  annoying, dude. I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know how to fix it. I don't know. You're just [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=436.52s)]
*  going to have to get used to it. And I know no one's going to get used to it and everyone's [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=441.0s)]
*  going to be really annoying about it. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=444.52s)]
*  mama mia. Stream's over. Pack it up. Anyway. Yeah. I didn't go to sleep. I went directly to the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  airport at JFK. JetBlue. I have so many gripes with JetBlue. Okay. I have so many gripes with [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=456.68s)]
*  JetBlue and I need to explain this to you. First of all, I'm doing mint because I'm balling. Okay. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=466.68s)]
*  First and foremost, mint is business. Normally LAX to JFK or like Los Angeles to New York, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=472.76s)]
*  there's no lie flat, right? JetBlue's mint on the other hand does have lie flat, which is [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=481.23999999999995s)]
*  really good because I have to sleep. Okay. Problem is JetBlue on the other hand, literally skimps out [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=488.2s)]
*  on something so key that I know you guys have probably experienced if you've ever flown with [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=497.24s)]
*  them. Okay. They literally do not hire baggage handlers. Like I know for a fact that this is not [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=501.96000000000004s)]
*  a coincidence. They do not hire enough baggage handlers. I know for a f**king fact because [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=511.48s)]
*  every other aspect of JetBlue is fine. Right. It's fine. It's whatever. It's there's a there's a [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=521.16s)]
*  basic there's a basic like cattle feeling that you have no matter what when you're when you're [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=526.76s)]
*  flying domestically in general, regardless of if you're flying business or you know or economy [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=532.76s)]
*  and that that part is all right. Okay. That part is all right. Who cares? It's just you got to do [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=540.2s)]
*  it. All right. Experience the marvels of technological achievement and be able to fly [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=545.48s)]
*  cross-country with ease. Yes, they're going to treat us like s**t. There's not much you can do [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=553.1600000000001s)]
*  about it. There's just nothing you can do about it in the process. Yes, it's going to be robotic [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=557.88s)]
*  for a little bit. Oh my God. This stream is going to be so annoying. Oh my God. I'm going to I'm [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=562.84s)]
*  going to Brian. I'm going to Brian. I'm so annoyed. I'm so annoyed. It's like, you know what? I'm just [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=566.9200000000001s)]
*  going to update the road caster. Let's see how it happens. Let's see how it works. Let's see if it [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=572.5200000000001s)]
*  just completely bricks my microphone in the process. It probably will, by the way. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Wc8PNz2MI&t=576.76s)]
