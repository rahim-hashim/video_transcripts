*  a thing. Andrew Cuomo. OK. Sally Goldenberg says senior editor for political says just conceded [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=38.239999999999995s)]

*  socialist. The magnitude of this cannot be overstated. Bill de Blasio comments. What's my [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=52.08s)]
*  other socialist thing? I should note that you are urging people not to rank former governor Andrew [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=57.68s)]
*  Cuomo. He was they were the two front runners going into this. It seemed like based on the polling. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=63.44s)]
*  But you do think that ultimately he's going to pull it out here based on what you're seeing so far. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=68.56s)]
*  Richie Torres. I don't know if you're watching. We're coming for you. Richie. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=72.64s)]

*  You're probably not going to survive another one of these races. Richie. But you better go [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=89.28s)]
*  work for a lobbyist real quick. Maybe get a job at APAC or something. Oh no, Richie. Oh no. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=94.08s)]
*  What was Richie Torres doing? The last election cycle that he was on the ballot on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=103.28s)]
*  coming up to the general. Oh, that's right. He was too busy posting not about his district, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=108.8s)]
*  poorest district in the country, but instead was posting about a Twitch streamer, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=113.92s)]
*  the only progressive Twitch streamer as a matter of fact, in the top 10 streams, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  live streamers in this incredibly right wing infested space, trying to get him de-platformed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=123.92s)]
*  Oh, Richie, you got a real nice seat there, man. Here's the winner by the way of tonight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=130.32s)]
*  Other than all of us. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=136.16s)]
*  Hello, everyone. Found and a half of chicken. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=141.04s)]
*  Again. Stir and fry it again. Mom? You're living in our house now, mom. We're not living in yours. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=144.4s)]
*  Why do I have to keep telling you this? And then on Wednesday, you forget to pick up Nikhil from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  school. All of your meddling, these questions, the TV series, he caused you to lose sight of the fact [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=159.28s)]
*  that you are not a good nanny. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=164.32s)]
*  I'm 85 years old, 85 years old, 85 years with my family, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=174.4s)]
*  all my black soul. Outlast everybody on my latest. Don't know me now, then you never know me later. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=178.4s)]
*  Say, I be in an elevator. To the top, go and find your own waiter. Drinking all the water, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=183.44s)]
*  pour for me by my waiter. Not just anyone, but the air. At the top, we're at peace. Got a great [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=189.44s)]
*  grandkid man, broken knees. Wrapped in a shawl just in case of cool breeze. But you never catch me, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  but to just catch this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=200.96s)]
*  I cannot believe this is going to be the next mayor in New York. That is kind of crazy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=204.0s)]
*  That is actually a wild state of affairs. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=234.0s)]
*  We got a tight trip, bitch, so don't try me. Don't need a nanny, cause I'm living my G. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=264.0s)]
*  Run this whole city like a Ramayani. Stay set and people up, see other shawty. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=271.36s)]
*  If you see me in the streets, don't be asking guany. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=275.84s)]
*  Is this real? Yes, this is real. What do you mean? It's Mr. Cardamom. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=294.0s)]
*  Look at this. Emerson college poll round one, February 3rd, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=324.0s)]
*  Cuomo at 33%, Mamdani at 1%. Listen, this is the first time I'll say it. Maybe podcasts do have [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=338.48s)]
*  motion. Maybe podcasts do have motion. Now this isn't obviously that, but there is a tremendous [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=346.96s)]
*  amount of effort paired up with Zoran's own personal charisma and his incredible team. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=353.36s)]
*  All of it came together so perfectly. A lot of resentment against establishment Democrats in [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=362.64s)]
*  general running up against someone like Andrew Cuomo. But yeah, this is wild. This is wild. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't know what to say. I mean, this is insane. This was a real people-backed movement [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  for a guy that... Don't get too comfortable, folks. The numbers from Israel aren't in yet. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. You helped this? Not me. You did. When we went out there, and we were [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=395.12s)]
*  walking through the streets with Zoran and all the people that were coming up, those were people [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=402.08s)]
*  that were working his campaign. Those are you guys. You guys did this. You all played a role [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=408.16s)]
*  in this. You went out, you door knocked, you canvassed, you phone banked, you told your friends, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=412.88000000000005s)]
*  you made unique content. This is an amazing moment for sure. And yeah, shouts out to Bradlander 100%. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=420.24s)]
*  I think he had every opportunity with Zoran, every opportunity, and he stood by him. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=430.8s)]
*  Respect, respect, respect to Bradlander. Are you going to start apartment hunting? Like I was just, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=435.36s)]
*  maybe I spoke too soon when I said, if Zoran wins, I'll move to New York. You know, I just, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=443.04s)]
*  that was, attentions were high. I don't know what I was saying. Start packing your bags, buddy. You [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=447.36s)]
*  can only live in Brooklyn or we'll roast your ass. We need a chopped cheese review to validate [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=452.32s)]
*  your say. That was just, I was not thinking. I was not, when I said things like, okay, remember, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=455.52000000000004s)]

*  said he would get a Biryani tattoo. Zoran is potentially the next mayor of New York City. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=475.76s)]
*  Okay. He just won the Democratic primary. He has to get the tattoo before I even talk about moving [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=483.04s)]
*  to New York City. And I also said, for a brief time period, I didn't say, I didn't say permanently. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=490.48s)]

*  points right now I'm getting the most Islam points anyway summer let's hear [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=735.52s)]
*  what build a Blasio has to say when I think it's a combination I did not [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=742.6s)]
*  expect Zoran to be leading up with the overall number one okay so this wasn't [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=745.6s)]
*  our issue this was like literally the build a Blasio and bunk as a summer [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=750.88s)]
*  let's hear what build a Blasio has to say when I think it's a combination I [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=755.0799999999999s)]
*  did not expect Zoran to be leading up with the overall number one okay so this [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=758.64s)]
*  wasn't our issue this was like literally the build a Blasio and bunk as audio [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=764.16s)]
*  you know with our rank choice system the number one goes tell you something but [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=768.36s)]
*  they don't tell you the whole thing I did not expect him to be leading at the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=771.36s)]
*  end of election night I think this is a stunning result I think the early votes [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=774.8s)]
*  who they came from where they come from are staggering we've never seen anything [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=778.48s)]
*  like it now also we have to reflect what's happened here Zoran run a [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=782.04s)]
*  positive campaign talking about affordability Cuomo ran a very negative [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=786.8s)]
*  fear-based campaign this has made a huge difference people at this point in New [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=791.28s)]
*  York City they are hurting for sure but they didn't just want to hear how bad [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=795.92s)]
*  everything was they wanted to have some sense of hope some sense of solution [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=799.64s)]

*  not like this was back in April. Oh my God. The, the, his poll numbers a month prior to this [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2619.54s)]
*  was 1%. He was pulling at 1%. So I don't know what he was pulling at April. I think it was like [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2626.58s)]
*  still probably like maximum, like 12%. I don't know if he, I don't know if he actually had [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2632.2599999999998s)]

*  April. This was in April. This was like the first week of April. Your previous year to our APAC [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2642.66s)]

*  is a poll after, but I think he was like around 10%. It doesn't matter. The point is, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2678.02s)]

*  Yeah. Andrew Cuomo's concession speak the end of what started off as an optimistic night, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2727.54s)]
*  but ended as a pretty somber night here in the West village. Cuomo campaign tells me that he [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2732.74s)]
*  will take some time, analyze all of the numbers once they're in and then decide whether or not [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2739.3799999999997s)]
*  he will choose to run on an independent ballot line in November. But from what I'm hearing [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2745.54s)]
*  from my sources inside the campaign, it's sounding pretty unlikely that Andrew Cuomo [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2751.14s)]
*  will continue to run in November, but of course we'll have to wait and see. No final decision has [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2755.7s)]
*  been made yet. And I've been talking about all of the unanswered questions. I will note some of [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2761.38s)]
*  the high profile supporters that back Andrew Cuomo's campaign. We're talking about people who four [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2765.94s)]
*  years ago called him to resign and then endorsed and people who four years ago were supporting [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2770.9s)]
*  Eric Adams and his bid for mayor. And then they supported Andrew Cuomo. What will happen with [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2776.02s)]
*  those people? Will they, if Andrew Cuomo doesn't run in November, will they in turn support Eric [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2781.3s)]
*  Adams and his campaign? Could Andrew Cuomo, if he steps out of this race, give new life to Eric [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2786.82s)]
*  Adams and his independent bid for city hall? That's some of the talk that I heard around the room [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2793.2200000000003s)]
*  this evening as folks all filed out and still, you know, people thinking about beginning to process [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2798.6600000000003s)]
*  what happened during this campaign, whether or not Andrew Cuomo had the level of visibility that [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2805.86s)]
*  really needed to help him or did in some ways the campaign treat his win as inevitable until the [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2811.7s)]
*  last few days really. You know, we saw folks from Zora Mamdani's campaign out and canvassing, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2817.7s)]
*  you know, going back months, Errol, I recall being at a church for a story back in March in Queens and [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2824.58s)]
*  the bishop asking me who is this Zora Mamdani guy that I keep hearing about. And we're beginning [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2830.3399999999997s)]
*  to hear from within the Cuomo campaign some acknowledgement that, you know, they perhaps were [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2835.46s)]
*  not out there with the kind of visibility that they could have had over the last few months. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2840.02s)]
*  Here largely we saw Andrew Cuomo speaking on Sunday mornings at churches, but really not spending [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2845.78s)]
*  time going out at subway stations and other places to really get his message across to voters. So, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2852.2599999999998s)]
*  you know, as I can hear, it's a pretty loud and excited and happy and joyful atmosphere. It sounds [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2858.66s)]
*  like at the Mamdani campaign, as soon as Andrew Cuomo gave his speech and he left the stage with [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2864.34s)]
*  this close group of supporters, the people in this room filed out. But again, I can think about [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2869.62s)]
*  so many people who endorsed him, from Congressman Adriana Espayat to Rodney's Bershaw-Hermeland, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2875.38s)]

*  that's even an indication that they knew going into this evening that the numbers were not going [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2885.8599999999997s)]
*  to be looking good, Errol. Okay, thanks very much, Ayanna. Great reporting tonight. And Courtney [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2889.7s)]
*  Gross here with me in the studio. We see on the split screen there, it looks like at the Zoran [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2895.3s)]
*  Mamdani's headquarters, Brad Lander just arrived, one of his rivals. They had a cross endorsement [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2901.38s)]
*  arrangement and he was greeted with a round of applause, hands in the air, people very glad to [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2906.5800000000004s)]
*  see him. He did an amazing thing, man. He really did. He could have zoned so hard and just tanked [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2912.9s)]
*  it and he didn't do that. He wouldn't have wanted to, but still. Cynthia Nixon, who we know has been [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2920.02s)]
*  posting on Instagram and other social media for people to not rank Andrew Cuomo. And we can go [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2928.5s)]
*  back to the 2018 gubernatorial primary where she obviously challenged the governor at the time. I [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2934.02s)]
*  think I got about 34% of the vote to Andrew Cuomo, 66% of the vote. So you can see, to me, I look at [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2939.78s)]
*  this party and this is a working families party now. This is a working families party party. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2947.06s)]
*  And you know, clearly they are celebrating. We were talking earlier about how Andrew Cuomo tried to [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2953.54s)]
*  destroy the working families party a number of years ago. There's a certain amount of signatures [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2959.14s)]
*  that these third parties need to acquire in a governor's race in order to keep their ballot [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2963.2999999999997s)]
*  line. And he increased the number of signatures that you needed trying to basically kill the [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2968.66s)]
*  working families party. And tonight, you know, they are clearly... Is this payback? I'm not sure, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2973.46s)]
*  but it certainly looks like it for them. Even beyond that, I mean, it looks in a lot of ways [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2979.46s)]
*  like Andrew Cuomo was sort of an organizing... Guys, I'm proud of all of you. I'm proud of every [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2984.5s)]
*  single person that went out and voted. I'm proud of every single person that went out and door knocked, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2991.38s)]
*  phone bank, gave up some funds. This is amazing. I hope we can keep mobilizing this community [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=2997.2200000000003s)]
*  in the appropriate direction and get some more cool moments like this. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3003.22s)]
*  ... mentioned Brad Lander by name until the very end where it says... [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3010.58s)]
*  Shouts out to the Democratic Socialist. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3013.62s)]
*  ... it was simply just an attack at against Andrew Cuomo. I think we saw going from the cross [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3015.2999999999997s)]
*  endorsement of Zoran Momdani and Brad Lander that occurred about two weeks or so ago to the final [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3021.54s)]
*  two weeks of the campaign that the left, we'd been talking about this for months, is would the left [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3026.98s)]
*  coalesce? How would they strategize with ranked choice voting? We saw that a little bit in 2021 [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3032.34s)]
*  when Andrew Yang ended up endorsing Catherine Garcia, which clearly helped her in 2021 not to [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3037.86s)]
*  overtake Eric Adams, but helped her get in that second place position and set 7,000 votes away [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3042.98s)]
*  from taking Eric Adams, the mayoralty from him. And clearly I think that, you know, we haven't seen [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3047.6200000000003s)]
*  the ranked choice voting simulation just yet, but I think in the final weeks of the campaign, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3052.98s)]
*  we clearly saw the left... I was the first person to go and stand out and my polling site for Momdani. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3056.7400000000002s)]
*  No matter what you feel about the rest of the field, whoever you decide to rank, just don't [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3060.74s)]
*  put Andrew Cuomo on your ballot. Right, and what's interesting is that this sort of coalescing [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3066.58s)]
*  was among people who are elected officials and really know politics. They really know the game. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3072.02s)]
*  They know how to buy ads and place ads and really focus their message and there was a certain amount [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3076.1s)]
*  of that that was really very notable because all of the people you're talking about are elected [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3081.7799999999997s)]
*  officials, right? Brad Lander, Zell Noor Myrie, Adrienne Adams, you know, had her a very emotional [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3085.86s)]
*  press conference where it was basically devoted to attacking Andrew Cuomo. So he inspired all of [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3091.2200000000003s)]
*  that, you know, sort of energy and in some cases vitriol and in the end, I guess it all worked to [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3097.46s)]
*  Zoran Momdani's advantage. Absolutely. His unfavorables going into this race, Andrew Cuomo's [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3103.86s)]
*  unfavorables were north of 50% and that was clearly what did him in is that, you know, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3108.7400000000002s)]
*  he had a certain number, a certain percentage of voters who clearly thought that he deserved a [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3115.38s)]
*  second chance and that he has a lot of progressive, you know, things on his agenda that he was able to [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3120.02s)]
*  accomplish, some progressive accomplishments that he did while he was governor, you know, increasing [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3126.26s)]
*  the same sex marriage. There's, you know, the bridges, we can count the amount of bridges, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3131.3s)]
*  the LaGuardia Airport. There's certainly a lot of that Andrew Cuomo did. Clearly the damage his [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3136.26s)]
*  career did that the sexual harassment scandal, clearly COVID, you can debate his leadership over [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3142.42s)]
*  COVID. It meant that voters were never, well, not never, but were certainly couldn't get over [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3148.1800000000003s)]
*  those particular aspects of his career. Right, right, right. And then Bobby, because I want to [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3154.9s)]
*  ask you, I won't ask you to- Seeing a lot of white men, yuck. A lot of white men, ew. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3159.14s)]
*  I don't like it. Right. I mean, Andrew Cuomo can claim to be a lot of things, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3167.38s)]
*  but he can't claim to be a freshman- Gross. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3171.22s)]
*  ... face on the scene for Democratic politics. Right. And I mean, I think the problem was, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3173.3799999999997s)]
*  he presented that as a strength, right? The fact that he's been around for a long time, he has the [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3178.1s)]
*  experience and pointed to what he has done, whereas Zoran Mdani was pointing to what he will do, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3183.2999999999997s)]
*  what he wants to do, was more of a forward-looking vision. And in the end, I guess that's what ended [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3190.8199999999997s)]
*  up winning out. I mean, I was thinking for months when it seemed like Andrew Cuomo was going to get [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3196.42s)]
*  into this race and it was clear that he would have a lot of support. I was wondering- [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3202.42s)]
*  Right, Bobby. ... were reminded of his past controversies, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3207.46s)]
*  whether that was immediately going to put a dent in his numbers, that people would remember [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3212.5s)]
*  the controversies of Cuomo's past and realize that they didn't want to relive those again with him [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3218.02s)]
*  in City Hall. That did not happen initially. In fact, we saw many, many dozens of elected [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3223.86s)]
*  officials who had been calling for Andrew Cuomo to step down as governor just four years ago, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3229.46s)]
*  right? Now, not only not opposing him running for the mayor of New York City, but actually endorsing [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3236.82s)]
*  him to run for mayor in many of those cases. So I was waiting for that mood to sort of shift, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3242.34s)]
*  and it didn't happen at first, but it seems like it happened just in the last few weeks when people [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3250.34s)]
*  really started to pay attention to this race. I mean, now looking back over the past few months, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3255.46s)]
*  there was this air of inevitability around Andrew Cuomo, but maybe one of the things we [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3260.1000000000004s)]
*  didn't really account for was the number of undecided voters. It seemed like those voters [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3265.06s)]
*  were up for grabs and that they could end up going to Andrew Cuomo, but in the end, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3270.9s)]
*  it seems that those undecided voters almost entirely went to Zoran Memdani because they were [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3275.06s)]
*  people who were looking for something else. So I think you're right. There are two very different [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3279.38s)]
*  visions. One very much forward-looking, one in a lot of ways was sort of backward-looking, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3286.98s)]
*  and I think we saw that generational divide, right? I mean, we saw this again and again with [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3293.1400000000003s)]
*  poll numbers. We saw voters under 45 or under 50 supported Zoran Memdani by something like two to [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3297.46s)]
*  one. Then we saw older voters overwhelmingly going to Andrew Cuomo. So we saw, you know, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3304.66s)]
*  we were all waiting to see on election day whether the turnout was going to be driven [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3312.02s)]
*  by young people, by new voters, people who were either newly registered or were voting for the [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3316.42s)]
*  first time. And it'll take a while to figure out, you know, how the numbers shake out, how many of [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3322.42s)]
*  these were new voters or whether it was just that, you know... God, local news political analysis is [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3326.5s)]
*  killing my soul. Congratulations, Zoran Memdani. That was the grassroots supporters for their [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3332.74s)]
*  extraordinary campaign. I mean, remember, like Zoran very clearly said Bernie Sanders was [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3338.66s)]
*  important in his political development. He said that, and you can see it in his campaign, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3345.7799999999997s)]
*  like he ran a Bernie-style campaign, grassroots, focused on door knocking, focused on doing the [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3352.58s)]
*  work, incredible messaging discipline, constantly talking about solving people's economic problems. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3359.46s)]
*  He did it. He did the damn thing. There will be a lot of back and forth, a lot of autopsies that [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3366.58s)]
*  take place. I will obviously participate in them as well. But one of the things you need to understand, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3372.26s)]
*  I think this is my, this is my major takeaway from the, maybe everyone who complains about being [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3377.94s)]
*  anti-Israel's and unpopular positions are for sure forever, forever shut the absolute up. It doesn't [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3382.82s)]
*  even work to jam up the comms anymore. Just run a campaign on universality and alleviating the [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3387.3s)]
*  economic pains people are experiencing. What is there? Mom Dancy? Is that's another... How do you, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3390.98s)]
*  how do you feel about all sectarian people not understanding that Shia are not? This is a big [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3397.2200000000003s)]
*  W for Muslims in America and New York City. It's a major W, but this candidate was running on [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3400.02s)]
*  identity politics. He was not. He was not running on identity politics at all. He got the news of the [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3404.82s)]
*  Brooklyn Democratic Party. Goddamn. That's major. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3409.62s)]
*  This is exactly what I thought this room would be looking like. I'm not gonna lie. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3426.3399999999997s)]
*  Use identity policies where it informs policy and it's not the end all be all. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3433.7799999999997s)]
*  No, but it wasn't like a cynical weaponization of identity politics. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3438.02s)]
*  Like he did, he did videos with different languages. That's not bad. That's just outreach. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3441.86s)]
*  Okay. Was it effing? I didn't see it. R.P. New York City. The Intifada has been globalized. Hey, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=3446.1s)]

*  And hopefully the poor not mum Donnie, but no matter what happens, the fact that someone [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4101.34s)]
*  I've never seen a choker star of David, by the way, that is choice. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4112.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4117.42s)]
*  Is that can the Jewish Hassan Abbey heads chime in on this? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4118.7s)]
*  Is this normal? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4121.820000000001s)]

*  That is the first that looks crazy. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4128.34s)]
*  It looks kinky. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4132.860000000001s)]
*  openly supports violence and I don't care against whom but the fact that someone who [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4136.94s)]
*  is not opposed to violence as a solution, the fact that someone who needs to again and [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4144.7s)]
*  again explain that he's not anti-Semitic rather than change his behavior. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4152.54s)]
*  The fact that that kind of it's so I will say this much. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4160.82s)]
*  There is like there's a so feel so gratifying just to see like this kind of a genocidal [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4165.9s)]
*  apartheid state in the past would get so much momentum. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4174.98s)]
*  It would have so much motion. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4179.78s)]
*  There would be weeks of discourse endlessly back and forth. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4181.66s)]
*  Was this actually was this actually a microaggression? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4185.5s)]
*  Was this not a microaggression? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4189.379999999999s)]
*  Like all of this stuff got so much institutional motion for so long, dude. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4190.7s)]
*  And it's crazy because like there are real instances of anti-Semitism. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4200.34s)]
*  That's not what we're talking about, right? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4205.3s)]
*  We're talking specifically about like, I don't know with Israel. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4207.099999999999s)]
*  I don't like what Israel is doing. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4211.099999999999s)]
*  Israel saying that was just unacceptable. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4213.099999999999s)]
*  It was completely unacceptable. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4216.66s)]
*  They were like, oh, you hate the Jewish state. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4217.66s)]
*  You hate Jews. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4219.599999999999s)]
*  You must be anti-Semitic. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4221.5s)]
*  Why do you care about Israel? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4222.8s)]
*  Why do you care about Israel so much? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4224.04s)]
*  Israel is a tiny nation. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4225.54s)]
*  Like this shit was such a successful way to just like halt discourse on such a glaringly [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4226.900000000001s)]
*  obvious glaringly obviously wrong thing to defend to support. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4237.02s)]
*  And now people just don't give a f**k at all. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4244.88s)]
*  Like it just does not, it does not matter. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4248.16s)]
*  And I will say it certainly makes me feel a sigh of relief. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4252.68s)]
*  I cannot believe, I mean, after what, 12 years of doing this shit, I cannot believe that [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4260.16s)]
*  I can, you know, openly say that this is an untenable situation and people can't just [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXruLCzBUs&t=4266.099999999999s)]
