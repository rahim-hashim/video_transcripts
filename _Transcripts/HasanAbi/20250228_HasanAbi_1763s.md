**HasanAbi:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0)
*  No, this is amazing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, this is Glenn Beckett saying Liz Wheeler tells me the Epstein [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=1.04s)]
*  files binder photo shoot was intended to be a message to the legacy media [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=4.16s)]
*  that they no longer had the power to manipulate the truth. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=8.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=11.44s)]
*  OK, it's it's crazy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=12.52s)]
*  So what they're doing now is like after it turned out to be a dud, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=14.88s)]
*  they all were like, we have this incredible thing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  We have this incredible thing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=20.46s)]
*  But I sometimes when I see some of these guys on their little thing, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=26.76s)]
*  I'm like, you're you're tweaked. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  Elon, I think it's tweaked. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=31.98s)]
*  But Elon is on like, I feel like isn't it ketamine for Elon? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=33.68s)]
*  I feel allegedly. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=36.86s)]
*  Yeah, but I think he's tweaked, too, because like when he was on stage, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=37.82s)]
*  I mean, I haven't I've done kind of one time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=40.96s)]
*  So he was like at the inauguration before the SIG. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=42.66s)]
*  He was like this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=45.92s)]
*  Yeah. The SIG is so we can. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=47.56s)]
*  Because you and I do that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=51.04s)]
*  But like it's now it's public. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=52.94s)]
*  We can do that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=54.54s)]
*  That's the SIG. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=55.8s)]
*  Because remember, remember they did. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=57.9s)]
*  I'm Jewish. I'm Jewish. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=60.06s)]
*  And it's OK. I'm not only Jewish, but we've hooked up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  And he did not complain. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=65.7s)]
*  Well, he complained. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=66.84s)]
*  But he was just like, well, I was an attentive. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=67.54s)]
*  But but it wasn't because of because of your Jewish background. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=70.28s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=74.04s)]
*  Well, he did call me withholding. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=75.48s)]
*  He did call me withholding. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  But yeah, but but but but you remember [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=78.38s)]
*  because remember someone they tried to do the this was like, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=82.62s)]
*  The OK sign was the. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=85.74s)]
*  All the people doing that were not like it was. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=87.48s)]
*  But they're like, oh, but it's just the OK sign. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  They're just they're running that back. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=92.88s)]
*  But now it's like now because their leader is so stupid and like [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=94.78s)]
*  I'm like the 56 year old troll [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=99.96s)]
*  that they're just doing that with the SIG Hile now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=103.12s)]
*  Not that I almost try to do it, which we can we can legally do my people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=105.46000000000001s)]

*  But we don't know. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=111.56s)]
*  Well, there is my former podcast co-host. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=113.22s)]
*  Apparently he throws it up quite a bit recently. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=115.86s)]
*  He's been throwing it up in the midst of his endless battle. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  No, Ethan on this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=123.4s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=126.0s)]
*  I would also be like, this is this is just something that they made up [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  that they believe exists. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=130.86s)]
*  This is a document that is a list of everybody that Jeffrey Epstein [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=132.2s)]
*  pimped out girls to on one list and that he has it and the government has it [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=135.28s)]
*  and refusing to release it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  I think a lot of this kind of like. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=141.5s)]
*  I hate to say it, kind of like, you know, dovetails with some QAnon stuff [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=144.1s)]
*  where like everybody is going to go down all at once, like all the pedos [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  are going to fucking look, we've already made Guantanamo [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=151.2s)]
*  or putting people in there like we got to. Yeah. And so. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=154.28s)]
*  All that hype. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  Was just like it ended up in like a list of like six or seven [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  or nine, I think like 15 influencers being given these binders full of. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=164.88s)]
*  Yeah. And the influence was like Jack, so I can like Mike Cernovich, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=168.92s)]
*  who has, as far as I understand, also harassed Virginia [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=172.0s)]
*  Jeffrey at the behest of Alan Dershowitz before. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=175.22s)]
*  Oh, I mean, listen, as I've always said to catch a file, you must become a file. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=178.0s)]
*  And and Cernovich has gone gonzo in his reporting on Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=183.32s)]
*  Yeah. You know, obviously having been charged at one point with himself. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=187.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think that was that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=191.04s)]
*  That's what I was thinking, too. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=192.48s)]
*  It wasn't because like he was a hatchet man for Alan Dershowitz. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=193.56s)]
*  I think he just has like a like a pro stance across the board. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=197.24s)]
*  He's like a pro activist. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=199.88s)]
*  He's a centrist. He's like the. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=201.8s)]
*  Doesn't matter that you were Jewish. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=204.28s)]
*  Actually, he was a was a Democrat. I'm with him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=206.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's like the dudes in the dudes in Israel that were trying to get out [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  the the concentration camp guards that were being prosecuted for raping. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=214.20000000000002s)]

*  St. Clair, who if you're watching this, you need to call me. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=370.08000000000004s)]

*  Actually, St. Clair, who just had the baby with Elon Musk. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=374.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  And so it's crazy to be him because, you know, he's this guy, Rogan O'Hanley, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=380.8s)]
*  who's like, you know, a right wing pugilist. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't really know what his job is. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=387.36s)]
*  I guess posting on Twitter. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=388.64s)]
*  I mean, most of these people's jobs are posting on Twitter. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=391.12s)]
*  And yeah, actually, I guess that's true. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=394.32s)]
*  But meanwhile, like Elon Musk is stuffing his his ex-girlfriend [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=396.56s)]
*  and having a baby with her. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  And he's, you know, standing here looking silly in a vest holding up a binder full of nothing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=402.96s)]
*  I mean, it's just ridiculous to me. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=407.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's it's it's pathetic, frankly. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=410.32s)]
*  And they try to come out in this triumphalist way, like, oh, we have the documents. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  This is and they all like it's it's very clear that they were like given [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=416.88s)]
*  like keywords to tweet. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  And one of those was transparent administration. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=423.2s)]
*  So all of them tweeted something to the effect that this is the most transparent administration [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  in history. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=429.6s)]
*  And they did not. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  And the conservatives, MAGA Twitter did not like that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=432.0s)]
*  Some of them didn't like it because they were like, why wasn't I chosen? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=434.16s)]
*  But then, yeah, others were like, well, what the f*** is this? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=436.88s)]
*  Like there were some real loyalists out there, which ironically enough, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=440.24s)]
*  like how I still to this day cannot understand how you can be an Epstein follower. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=445.44s)]
*  Not like in the way that we are, but I mean, like in the in the way that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=452.16s)]
*  we follow in his footsteps. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=456.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  Not in our way, but like, you know, following what he's doing and not recognize that like [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=458.64s)]
*  Trump's labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, before unceremoniously resigning, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  revealed that he gave a sweetheart plea bargain deal to Jeffrey Epstein that allowed him to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=469.84s)]
*  continue doing while he was in prison because they told him he belonged to intelligence. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=474.0s)]
*  So how does how do they not like, this is the thing I don't understand about MAGA world. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=480.64s)]
*  I mean, they don't really, they're not known for being thinkers, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=486.08s)]
*  No, but it doesn't make sense that it doesn't make sense that they just can't put two and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=490.4s)]
*  two together. Like why would Trump elevate this guy, Alexander Acosta into his administration [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=496.4s)]
*  after he very clearly allowed Jeffrey Epstein to get away with crimes? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I think you said with grimes, I'd like to get over with Grimes, but [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=509.52s)]
*  Grimes. Oh, yeah. It's front of the show. Grime, excuse me. Excuse me. You also need to call me. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=515.04s)]
*  You need to call me. I can fix it. I can Grimes. If you're watching, I can fix it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=518.8s)]
*  I can fix it. This is what happens when Liz is not on chat. I'm sorry. I apologize. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=523.3599999999999s)]
*  She says she knows that she knows about my, I mean, it's parasocial technically at this time, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=529.04s)]
*  but Grimes I think can fuel my brain, but, but she's probably got Neuralink. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=532.64s)]
*  I'm thinking really hard, but yeah, it's so stupid that like, I think, I think really what it is, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=538.32s)]
*  and I hate to sound like the liberals that we are, but it really is like almost like cult-like [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=547.84s)]
*  behavior. Like Trump can only be failed. So like if Trump, okay, yeah, Trump maybe elevated this guy [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  who like you wouldn't have normally suspected as being picked for the post to, you know, be his [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=560.24s)]
*  labor secretary who basically was only notable for like giving Jeffrey Epstein this sweetheart [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=565.6s)]
*  deal. And like, funnily enough, like that was part of the reason like it became such a big story [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=570.0s)]
*  was because of like he had to resign. It was like grilled about it in Congress and shit. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=576.24s)]
*  And, and like a lot of the QAnon people, which is kind of like dissolved and like diffused into all [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  the rest of the mega stuff sort of took that as like he was, he was setting, he was setting [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=589.04s)]
*  Acosta up because he's a white hat and Acosta is like a guy that he was like putting out there [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=595.76s)]
*  for a reason. So he did this actually to oppose. Oh, okay. Cause it got so much attention. You see [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=600.8s)]
*  what I'm saying? And then, and then they, you know, killed him when Trump was president and you know, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=608.4s)]
*  Trump's own DOJ oversaw the, the execution, the assassination of Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=615.28s)]
*  I don't know how they make up for that, but I guess it's because Bill Barr also turned on Trump [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=623.12s)]
*  afterwards. So he's a rhino. He was always a rhino and Barr looks, looks amazing too. I love looking [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=627.04s)]

*  I mean, not like politically or in any way, but I like looking at him. It looks like it's, yeah, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=659.68s)]
*  he looks like, I think Rex also kind of used to look like that too. There's a bunch of dudes. They [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=665.2800000000001s)]
*  just like had that look to them. Now they're all, it's just Tom Homan now and the new administration [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=669.12s)]
*  and Tom Homan is like, unfortunately not exactly a pleasant to look at in the same way that like [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=676.24s)]
*  Bill Barr was because he's just like, he's melting and he sounds unwell all the time. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZUk_rYqP0&t=682.5600000000001s)]
