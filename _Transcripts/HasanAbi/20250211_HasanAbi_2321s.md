# The Ceasefire In Gaza Is At Risk Of Collapsing | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk)
*  There are 22 different v***ations, but the top line v***ations obviously were, you know, Israel refusing all of the aid that they said they would let in to the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=0.0s)]
*  They never actually adhered to the s*** fire conditions at all. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  But what was really interesting... [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=18.6s)]
*  It's business as usual. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=20.6s)]
*  And the irony, of course, is that nothing is different, even with his like handling of Ukraine, for example. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=27.6s)]
*  Like when he talks about Ukraine, this is a big point of contention now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=34.0s)]
*  He just like openly is saying, we want $500 billion worth of your minerals. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=36.900000000000006s)]
*  That in and of itself is literally, and I cannot stress this enough, identical to the ways in which we have interest in Ukraine from the jump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=43.2s)]
*  It's just openly stating that reality. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=56.2s)]
*  That's the only difference between Donald Trump is just that he says the quiet part out loud. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=60.2s)]
*  Just like the Biden administration also quietly was trying to do a mass relocation initiative for all the Palestinians. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=68.2s)]
*  And the Egyptian government said no, the Jordanian government said no, they all basically said, no, that's a ridiculous thing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=75.2s)]
*  We're not going to do mass ethnic displacement in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=82.2s)]
*  Donald Trump was like, no, you have to do it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=85.2s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=87.2s)]
*  It's not quiet, it's just loud, but the policies don't actually change. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=88.2s)]
*  To be fair, Mexico is an indigenous name. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=93.2s)]
*  America is a colonizer name. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=94.2s)]
*  I don't really care though. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=96.2s)]
*  What's really crazy is how quickly certain cores have caved like TikTok. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=97.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, there is no sense whatsoever to this iteration of Trump. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=101.2s)]
*  That's that much is a certainty. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=105.2s)]
*  If anything, I think every institution is basically telling you that reality over and over again. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=107.2s)]
*  And it's seemingly it's seeming there is seemingly no counter to this kind of nonsense anyway. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=114.2s)]
*  Yeah, the craziest part of me about him saying this stuff out loud is how he was impeached over doing what is in essence the same type of quid pro quo with Ukraine. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=121.2s)]
*  No, that's there's a difference between the initial impeachment for his quid pro quo with Ukraine. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=128.2s)]
*  That was for his own personal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=134.2s)]
*  That was directly to over the person that he was running against. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=136.2s)]
*  Right. He wanted dirt. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=140.2s)]
*  He was like, there are congressional approved, Congress approved weapons that are supposed to be transferred to you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=141.2s)]
*  I'm going to do something that is unconstitutional and stop those from going to you unless you give me some blackmail. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=149.2s)]
*  OK, if you give me some blackmail, I'll continue those weapons transfers. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=156.2s)]
*  But if you give me some blackmail on Joe Biden, I will, you know, I will continue the weapons transfers flowing into Ukraine. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=160.2s)]
*  That was for something that is like deliberately his own personal. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=169.2s)]
*  That was something that he did specifically for his own personal gain. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=176.2s)]
*  It was a very selfish thing that he was doing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=179.2s)]
*  So that's a little bit different than when he says Ukraine, if you have a lot of rare earth minerals, I want it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=181.2s)]
*  You know, we'll keep giving you weapons, but you have to give us the minerals that that in and of itself is just American foreign policy laid out in full display. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=188.2s)]
*  Right. It is very similar to when Donald Trump, the last time around, basically turned around and said after it came out that MBS, Mohammed bin Salman had assassinated Jamal Khashoggi, an American legal permanent resident and a Washington Post journalist. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=197.2s)]
*  When he got him, when when MBS basically assassinated him in a Turkish in the Turkish Saudi embassy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=214.2s)]
*  OK. And when that happened, everyone was like, Whoa, what the hell are you still going to give? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=222.2s)]
*  Are you still going to give weapons to Saudi Arabia? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=229.2s)]
*  And he basically turned around and said, What are you going to do? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=231.2s)]
*  Do you have a billion dollars? If they don't buy it from us, they're going to buy it from somewhere else. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=234.2s)]
*  Do you do you have a billion dollars to buy these weapons? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=239.2s)]
*  Somebody's got to buy these weapons. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=242.2s)]
*  That is American foreign policy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=244.2s)]
*  But you rarely ever hear American foreign policy be so openly explained in this way. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=247.2s)]
*  Usually, Democrats at least know that you have to masquerade as like someone who cares about the rules and someone who is interested in, I guess, upholding a certain moral position, a certain moral posture. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=255.2s)]
*  That's why the Israel stuff under a Democratic rulership was incredibly difficult for them to deal with while also propagandizing, because it was very obviously at odds with the international rule based order. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=270.2s)]
*  Right. It was very obviously at odds with that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=287.2s)]
*  And the Democrats could not contend with that reality. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=289.2s)]
*  And they had a very hard time taking a defensive posture in the in the ways that they normally would. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=292.2s)]
*  Trump doesn't do that. He just openly will be like, Yep. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=299.2s)]
*  What are you going to do about it? Yeah, this is it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=302.2s)]
*  This is my thing. I'm going to get money in return for all the weapons that were given to Ukraine. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=305.2s)]
*  That's it. That's a good thing. No, I don't necessarily think it's a good thing because it still continues American foreign policy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=311.2s)]
*  And that is damaging and devastating for the entire globe. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=319.2s)]
*  So I don't think it's like necessarily a better thing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=324.2s)]
*  I mean, and as we saw after the first Trump administration ended and the Biden administration began, it didn't really change the dynamic for the Democrats at all. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=329.2s)]
*  I'll give you the best example of this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=340.2s)]
*  Donald Trump considered the on Sardilla administration also a law movement to be a group. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=343.2s)]
*  OK. Why did he do that? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=350.2s)]
*  Well, because Saudi Arabia was pummeling Yemen at the time they were doing a side in Yemen at the time. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=352.2s)]
*  For those of you who don't know, against the on Sardilla movement and Saudi Arabia had his own dog in the fight. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=357.2s)]
*  Basically, they had their own parallel government that was the initial government originally. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=365.2s)]
*  And Donald Trump being MBS is a favorite guy, MBS, who also obviously purchased a bunch of Jared Kushner properties and gave Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son in law, billions of dollars. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=370.2s)]
*  Donald Trump did the bidding of both Israel and Saudi Arabia willingly for Israel. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=387.2s)]
*  He put sanctions on the former ICC prosecutor. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=393.2s)]
*  He's putting sanctions on this one as well, by the way. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=396.2s)]
*  And for Saudi Arabia, he put the on Sardilla movement as a state designated group. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=399.2s)]
*  OK. Now, under the Biden administration, the argument I was making is that this is still a continuation, right? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=407.2s)]
*  Like American foreign policy goes in one direction. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=413.2s)]
*  The Biden administration took the on Sardilla movement out of the state sponsored designation. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=415.2s)]
*  And that came, of course, alongside China coming in and cutting a side deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, normalizing relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=421.2s)]
*  The Yemeni retaliation was far too much for Saudi Arabia. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=432.2s)]
*  And therefore, therefore for them, they basically wanted to put an end to the fighting anyway. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=439.2s)]
*  OK, for financial reasons. So they did that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=446.2s)]
*  And the Biden administration took on Sardilla off the designation. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=450.2s)]
*  But what did the Biden administration do after Israel, after October 7 and Israel doing a side in Gaza? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=456.2s)]
*  The on Sardilla movement came out and was the de facto government of Yemen at this point and said, we are going to put a blockade on the Red Sea. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=465.2s)]
*  We are going to intercept all vessels that are going through the Red Sea, whether they are directly connected to Israel or they're stopping at Israeli ports or in any way, shape or form is like, you know, not collaborating with this blockade. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=474.2s)]
*  As long as Israel is still doing a jet, this blockade will continue. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=489.2s)]
*  And they started doing that. They started intercepting ships. They started taking ships. They started taking hostages. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=493.2s)]
*  OK. And the American government called that piracy and the Biden administration started Operation Prosperity Guardian and put the on Sardilla movement back on the list. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=499.2s)]
*  So it's literally a continuation. No matter what American foreign policy, it doesn't deviate all that much from American foreign policy does not deviate all that much from one leadership to the next. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=511.2s)]
*  There is a a direction that it's going in almost always, regardless of whether a Democrat is in charge or a Republican is in charge. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=525.2s)]
*  That's it. Because foreign policy is uniparty in this country. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=537.2s)]
*  The Democrats on the one hand will do their very best. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=542.2s)]
*  The Democrats on the one hand will do their very best to basically try and make it seem like what they're doing is at the behest of a international rule based order. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=548.2s)]
*  Laughable notion when they are attached to Israel by the hip and are allowing Israel to continue doing a jet side with the weapons that we're sending to Israel. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=560.2s)]
*  But they still try to make it. They still try to manufacture consent for that. Right. That's why they did the port, for example. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=572.2s)]
*  Remember the port, the quarter of a billion dollar port that was basically just for Israel for America to say, no, no, no. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=580.2s)]
*  Israel's letting eight into Gaza. See, we have a port there. Port never worked. Didn't matter. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=589.2s)]
*  The one time they utilized the port was when they, you know, used it to extract used it for an Israeli military campaign. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=594.2s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it was a floating pile of trash. It never actually operated, but it didn't matter. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=602.2s)]
*  The real reason for the port wasn't actually to offer aid, additional aid to the Palestinians, because if they wanted to offer additional aid to the Palestinians, they could have done so by forcing Israel to bring in more aid trucks into the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=608.2s)]
*  They didn't have to build a two hundred and fifty million dollar port. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=622.2s)]
*  No, they did that because Israel was refusing to let in aid. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=627.2s)]
*  And this offered some semblance of plausible deniability to say, see, they let us put the port in here. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=633.2s)]
*  Clearly, they care about getting in as much aid as possible, but there's just logistical problems. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=639.2s)]
*  Two hundred and fifty million dollars just for that. Tell me about how Doge is going after government funding. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=644.2s)]
*  OK, yeah, they only use the peer for one hostage rescue operation that ended up killing two hundred and fifty Palestinians in the process, by the way, famously. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=652.2s)]
*  Here's the timeline on the port. Two hundred and thirty million dollar U.S. Gaza aid pier opens on May 17th, May 25th is damaged. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=660.2s)]
*  June 7th is reconnected. June 9th, UN pauses distribution after Israeli forces killed two hundred and seventy four Palestinians. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=668.2s)]
*  June 14th is removed. June 19th is reconnected. June 28th is removed. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=674.2s)]
*  July 9th announced it will be briefly reinstalled and permanently removed. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=678.2s)]
*  Two hundred and fifty million for a decently sized port is not that bad of a deal, though. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=681.2s)]
*  It is a horrible deal because the port was not utilized at all for actual humanitarian aid purposes, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=685.2s)]
*  especially considering that the real way to put humanitarian aid on the ground was by forcing Israel to send in more trucks when Israel was refusing to send in more trucks. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=691.2s)]
*  There's no need for a fucking American portable port. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=701.2s)]
*  The one time that they actually used the port was for this military operation to the. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=705.2s)]
*  Yeah, they did the Timmu port. It was ridiculous. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=710.2s)]
*  It was a quarter of a billion dollar marketing initiative. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=713.2s)]
*  That's what they spent it on. OK, that's what they spent it on. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=717.2s)]
*  Lights, two hundred and fifty million dollars on fire. Holy shit. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=721.2s)]
*  What a wow. That's a great deal. I mean, that's you just described the American that you just described the Pentagon, by the way. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=723.2s)]
*  And also now we have American Mercs as well. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=728.2s)]
*  More than one hundred American mercenaries now in Gaza. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=731.2s)]

*  The super sick, totally legal operation where they pulled up an aid truck and then just started blasting anyone in sight. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=740.2s)]
*  Yeah. So at the time. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=744.2s)]
*  What was American foreign policy? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=748.2s)]
*  It was called a peer. Not sure why you're saying a port. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=750.2s)]
*  Whatever peer port semantics. What are you talking about? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=753.2s)]
*  It didn't work for either anyway. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=756.2s)]
*  OK, it was a portable peer that they built and it didn't work, but it was never supposed to actually work regardless. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=759.2s)]
*  OK, that is my point. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=766.2s)]
*  So when Donald Trump says like, oh, we're going to we're going to finish, we're going to finalize the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, make no mistake. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=769.2s)]
*  That is a part of American foreign policy. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=776.2s)]
*  That is a part of the grand design that America has. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=779.2s)]
*  Now, are there actual naysayers within the State Department? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=783.2s)]
*  Absolutely. Just like there were people who also criticized Biden from within the State Department when Biden was attached to the hip and letting Israel do whatever it wanted. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=786.2s)]
*  There were plenty of people who were saying this is going to diminish our soft power capabilities around the world. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=799.2s)]
*  Everyone is looking at us and recognizing that nobody cares about the international rule based order. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=807.2s)]
*  If you do, if our soft power capabilities go away, then all of a sudden the only thing we have is hard power that in and of itself is not going to be good enough. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=813.2s)]
*  OK, I thought your content got new. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=823.2s)]
*  The stream is evil. Yes, I am an evil streamer. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=826.2s)]
*  If you think I am your enemy and if you think I am evil in general, you really got to reorient your priorities unless you're already a Trump supporter, in which case then that's fine. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=830.2s)]
*  I mean, of course, I welcome Trump supporters saying I'm evil. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=840.2s)]
*  That's understandable. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=845.2s)]
*  I am diametrically opposed to the way you view the world. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=847.2s)]
*  Anyway, those supporters are at least interesting what they're hating. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=850.2s)]
*  Yeah. Anyway, we'll look at the Emmanuel Fabian take in a second. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=853.2s)]
*  I have to be real quick, though. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=857.2s)]
*  All this goes on this statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=859.2s)]
*  There's more of it coming in. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=865.2s)]
*  He says I've just concluded a four hour discussion in the political security cabinet. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=867.2s)]
*  We all expressed outrage at the shocking situation of our three hostages who were released last Saturday. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=873.2s)]
*  We also the pictures you're seeing was just arrived for a meeting. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=880.2s)]
*  Oh, is it? Forgive me. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=884.2s)]
*  I'll carry on. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=887.2s)]
*  We also welcomed President Trump's demand for the release of our hostages by Saturday noon. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=888.2s)]
*  And we also welcome the president's revolutionary vision for the future of Gaza in the light of Hamas announcement, Hamas's announcement of its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=895.2s)]
*  Last night, I ordered the idea to amass forces inside and around the Gaza Strip. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=910.2s)]
*  This operation is taking place at these hours. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=915.2s)]
*  It will be completed in the very near future. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=919.2s)]
*  The decision that I passed unanimously in the cabinet is this. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=924.2s)]
*  If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday at noon, the ceasefire will be terminated and the idea will return to intense fighting until Hamas is released. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=928.2s)]
*  Fighting until Hamas is finally defeated. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=938.2s)]
*  And of course, it was Hamas that had earlier claimed that it was Israel breaking the deal, the terms of the deal by not putting sufficient aid. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=943.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was Israel breaking the deal, by the way, which is crazy because the New York Times, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=954.2s)]
*  which famously has written about Trump's ethnic cleansing campaign as a development project, which is crazy. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=962.2s)]
*  Okay. Has also written an article on this. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=973.2s)]
*  Okay. Where they buried the lead. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=979.2s)]
*  So we covered the violations extensively yesterday. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=982.2s)]
*  Okay. There are 22 different violations. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=988.2s)]
*  But the top line violations obviously were, you know, Israel refusing all of the aid that they said they would let in to the Gaza Strip. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=991.2s)]
*  They never actually adhered to the ceasefire conditions at all. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1002.2s)]
*  But what was really interesting, and this is Jeremy Scahill's reporting on it as well, nine paragraphs, nine paragraphs into today's New York Times story on the situation with the Gaza ceasefire. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1007.2s)]
*  Readers are informed that Israeli officials and international mediators said Hamas, Hamas's claims about Israel's violation of the ceasefire were accurate. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1018.2s)]
*  Nine paragraphs in the current standoff stems in part from Hamas's accusation that Israel failed to uphold his promises for the first phase of the ceasefire. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1028.2s)]
*  A six week period that started on January 19th. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1036.2s)]
*  Under the terms of the deal, Israel was required to send hundreds of thousands of tents into Gaza, among other humanitarian supplies, a promise that Hamas says Israel is not kept. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1039.2s)]
*  Speaking on the condition of anonymity discuss a sensitive matter, three Israeli officials and two mediators said that Hamas's claims were accurate. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1048.2s)]
*  That's insane. Nine paragraphs deep. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1055.2s)]
*  That's I mean, this is ridiculous, dude. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1058.2s)]
*  It is ridiculous. It is ridiculous. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1061.2s)]
*  It is crazy to me that the New York Times, the gray lady, okay, the paper of record is this bad. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1064.2s)]
*  I mean, deliberately, okay, this bad, this deliberately in terms of in terms of doing propaganda for the state of Israel and for America's interest in the state of Israel in Gaza, the ethnic cleansing campaign in Gaza. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1073.2s)]
*  And it's additionally wild because like the New York Times does this worse than everybody else. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1090.2s)]
*  Like the New York Times is more obvious with its propaganda than all of the other all of the other Western publications. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1094.2s)]
*  Yeah, I covered this before as well. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1103.2s)]
*  Out of all of the Western publications, New York Times truly remains in a league of its own. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1106.2s)]
*  Almost every headline from major news org has mentioned the reason why Hamas is postponing the release. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1110.2s)]
*  Then there's the Times. Hamas postpones release of hostages until further notice. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1114.2s)]
*  Hamas says it will stop releasing hostages, accuses Israel of ceasefire violations. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1119.2s)]
*  Like these aren't even these aren't even I think they're not they're not using a passive voice when describing this where they're basically claiming that Hamas might be lying. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1122.2s)]
*  Right. But even then they at least say even then they at least say what the reason is Hamas suspends hostage release says Israel is not following the ceasefire agreement. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1134.2s)]
*  Hamas accused Israel of ceasefire violations and says it will delay next release of hostages. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1143.2s)]
*  New York Times on the other hand is straight up saying Hamas is just postponing the release of hostages until further notice. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1148.2s)]
*  I wonder why I wonder why since the ceasefire agreement Israel's bomb the shop house in Gaza while refusing to allow in the agreed upon amounts of aid. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1153.2s)]
*  None of these facts appear in the New York Times reporting today just a vague reference to Hamas accusations. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1161.2s)]
*  So when they do actually report on it, they barely they barely say like even when they were mentioning it initially. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1165.2s)]
*  Even when they were mentioning it yesterday, they were like Hamas is indefinitely postpone the release of Israeli hostages who were said to be freed from the Gaza Strip this weekend. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1174.2s)]
*  A spokesman said on Monday accusing Israel's government of violating an already fragile ceasefire agreement that is supposed to be the that is supposed to be the title. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1180.2s)]
*  OK, in a statement on Telegram Abu Obaidah, the spokesman for Hamas military wing accused Israel of a host of violations of the ceasefire agreement. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1191.2s)]
*  That's supposed to be the headline. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1198.2s)]
*  And then you're supposed to elaborate further on what the actual hostage release violations have been. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1199.2s)]
*  What the ceasefire the the the lack of commitment from Israel in terms of following the conditions of the ceasefire have been. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1206.2s)]
*  And these accusations have been confirmed and substantiated by the Israeli side as well. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1215.2s)]
*  The New York Times is newest reporting shows that reality, except it is nine paragraphs in nine. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1222.2s)]
*  That's crazy. I'm sorry. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1229.2s)]
*  But this is obviously like doing propaganda for American foreign policy, American State Department interests and not actually not actually accurately describing what is going on. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1231.2s)]
*  Your job as a newspaper is to inform people. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1249.2s)]
*  Your job as a newspaper is not to lie by a mission or to show only one side or to just basically show both sides and say, here, make up your mind. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1254.2s)]
*  Your job is to say the truth. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1264.2s)]
*  This is a disservice in the in the most like a political way to describe the situation. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1267.2s)]
*  The New York Times is doing a disservice to its readers so consistently on this issue. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1275.2s)]
*  OK, it is additionally terrifying and additionally damaging when the New York Times is doing a disservice to journalism at a time when people need good journalism more than ever. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1281.2s)]
*  OK, it's crazy. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1296.2s)]
*  It's crazy that this is happening when so much of the misinformation economy is supercharged on Twitter and people literally just get rewarded. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1299.2s)]
*  Like there is an incentive structure for a lying. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1314.2s)]
*  OK, the media needs to lock in. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1317.2s)]
*  This is the moment where the media needs to lock in and do good journalism to show Americans to restore some confidence in Americans in the minds of Americans to basically say like this isn't correct. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1321.2s)]
*  Here's what is actually happening. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1335.2s)]
*  And yet they have leaned so desperately into doing propaganda that they're basically destroying the last bit of good faith that they have in an effort to ensure that the remaining readership of like older readers of the New York Times stay committed to the project in Israel. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1337.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1357.2s)]
*  Read it in Israel's mass circulation newspaper, Marif. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1358.2s)]
*  The Israeli Army and Security Establishment confirmed that so far Hamas has not violated the ceasefire deal. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1361.2s)]
*  At the same time, the Defense Establishment and the IDF say that so far the terrorist organization has not violated the agreement and therefore it is very doubtful whether Israel can take steps against Hamas at this stage. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1366.2s)]
*  But it doesn't matter. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1375.2s)]
*  It looks like the Israeli Army doesn't want to go back to full scale war, something that I also mentioned. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1376.2s)]
*  Remember, because while Benjamin Netanyahu wants the war to continue, Benjamin Netanyahu wants to go back to genocide. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1380.2s)]
*  Okay. Benjamin Netanyahu's followers and those to the far right, even more right wing than Benjamin Netanyahu, want the bombing campaign to continue. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1388.2s)]
*  There isn't as much appetite from the military. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1396.2s)]
*  And part of that is because they took a great deal of damage. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1400.2s)]
*  This is something the economy is in ruins. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1405.2s)]
*  Like the Israeli economy is in ruins. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1411.2s)]
*  Morale is in ruins. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1414.2s)]
*  Like the very fact that the ceasefire was being discussed and they were still doing operations in North Gaza at the time before the ceasefire was implemented and Israel took Israel experienced 15 of their soldiers get exploded in North Gaza, a place that they had supposedly completely ethnically cleansed is a major, major L. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1416.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1443.2s)]
*  These guys do not have unlimited resources. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1444.2s)]
*  They have unlimited bombs that come from the United States of America, and they have utilized those unlimited bombs. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1446.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1453.2s)]
*  Having said that, however, in terms of boots on the ground, military warfare, at the end of the day, there's a there's a finite amount of resources there. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1454.2s)]
*  You don't have endless amounts of soldiers. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1464.2s)]
*  You also don't have an endless amount of appetite for death and destruction from said soldiers, especially when they just want to go back and be a DJ, you know, they want to go back to their DJ jobs. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1468.2s)]
*  They want to go back to making chocolate hummus or whatever. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1480.2s)]
*  Okay. Or do marketing jobs like these are reservists. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1485.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1489.2s)]
*  So there is no permanent warfare that Israel can maintain. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1490.2s)]
*  That's part of the reason why I thought that there would be at least some semblance of a ceasefire as some kind of ceasefire that would be maintained so that they could at least like recoup and recover and restore numbers in their forces so they could end up, I don't know, either going back into Gaza, but potentially just the engage in the permanent annexation of the West Bank. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1493.2s)]
*  Best case scenario, Israel will back down from the crisis it created by predictably and blatantly via our Gaza. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1519.2s)]
*  And then Israel will claim victory and Trump will take credit saying his threats against Hamas did the job on this front. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1524.2s)]
*  There is also some additional news that suggests that even Benjamin Netanyahu understands what I'm saying. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1531.2s)]
*  Axios is quoting Israeli officials Netanyahu does not demand all 76 sausages on Saturday, but wants to continue implementing the first phase. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1539.2s)]
*  So Trump gave Benjamin Netanyahu the opportunity to go back to genocide saying that Benjamin Netanyahu can do whatever he wants. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1547.2s)]
*  If he wants to veto what I'm suggesting here, he has every right to do so. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1556.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1560.2s)]
*  And Benjamin Netanyahu seemingly is taking that opportunity. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1561.2s)]
*  What Israeli media close to Netanyahu is saying this is from Elint News. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1564.2s)]
*  We publish in the edition cabinet source to channel 14. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1568.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, this is BB's channel. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1571.2s)]
*  High chance that Hamas will blow up the deal in the coming days. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1574.2s)]
*  We are preparing for a massive war. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1576.2s)]
*  This could be posturing from Benjamin Netanyahu, especially considering that on the other side, they're still stating on the other side, they're still stating that they want they want to, you know, continue the first stage of the ceasefire. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1578.2s)]
*  Following a fresh assessment, the IDF says it is further bolstering force in the southern command after Hamas said it would postpone the release of hostages. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1596.2s)]
*  The military describes the bolstering of troops as extensive and says it included calling up reservists. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1603.2s)]
*  The reinforcement of troops and mobilization of reservists are being carried out in preparation for various scenarios, the IDF says. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1608.2s)]
*  So there is conflicting reporting on this, but I still suspect there's conflicting reporting on this, but I still suspect that like they they don't have they have very limited capabilities of like bringing troops back into Gaza at this stage. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1614.2s)]
*  The IDF Southern Command is approving battle plans with Gaza Strip in the event of the ceasefire hostage deal with Hamas collapses, according to the military. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1630.2s)]
*  Currently, two IDF divisions are responsible for defenses along the Gaza border in the Philadelphia corridor and the 162nd Division in Gaza Division. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1636.2s)]
*  Since last night, several brigades and special forces units were deployed to the southern command to bolster the existing forces. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1643.2s)]
*  Several more brigades are on standby and will be deployed to southern command if necessary. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1649.2s)]
*  Additional divisions are currently in the process of preparing for possible deployment of Gaza, depending on the developments. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1654.2s)]
*  The IDF says there are no changes to guidelines for civilians at this stage, and it is prepared for a variety of scenarios. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1659.2s)]
*  Troop movement and mobilization is is yet another way to apply pressure and to say, oh, yeah, we're ready to go. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1666.2s)]
*  If need be, over 50% of coalition voters in the Channel 12 survey, by the way, this is from a couple days ago on the 8th of February, according to Times of Israel. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1675.2s)]
*  70% of Israelis support the second phase of the hostage ceasefire deal. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1685.2s)]
*  So even the appetite from the broader Israeli public for continued war has has definitely softened. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1689.2s)]
*  Over 50% of the coalition voters in Channel 12 survey back the second stage of the agreement, which would see Hamas free some 60 captives, 24 of them living in exchange for full IDF withdrawal from Gaza. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1699.2s)]
*  70% of the Israeli public is in favor of continuing the second phase of the hostage release and ceasefire deal with Hamas, according to a television poll aired Friday, which found a nearly identical figure backs US President Donald Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians outside the Gaza Strip. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1710.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's trying to undermine it because no one because the popular broad popular support for any initiative is completely negligible in this circumstance. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1723.2s)]
*  I need you to understand this. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1735.2s)]
*  Okay, it is completely and utterly irrelevant. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1737.2s)]
*  What Americans want don't matter. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1741.2s)]
*  What even the Israelis want don't matter. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1743.2s)]
*  What the Israelis want matter to a certain degree, because that is what keeps Benjamin Netanyahu alive politically. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1745.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1753.2s)]
*  And he recognizes that because on the other end of this bargain, once the war cabinet is disbanded, if Benjamin Netanyahu doesn't have enough popular support, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1754.2s)]
*  on his own with his own party and the coalition that he has, then he's no longer going to be in power and he'll go to jail, most likely he'll be his prosecution will continue. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1764.2s)]
*  So on that front, yes, I think that there is a certain degree. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1774.2s)]
*  There is a certain degree of following what the broad popular sentiment is. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1780.2s)]
*  That's the reason why they also attacked Lebanon because that was a very popular position. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1787.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1791.2s)]
*  And it only increased his support. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1792.2s)]
*  But having Donald Trump having Donald Trump be Benjamin Netanyahu's guy is certainly a benefit for for Netanyahu because everyone in Israel understands that they can't do anything without full blown full-throated American support. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1794.2s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is a very popular position. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1802.2s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's big selling point for years was basically Benjamin Netanyahu's big selling point for years was how he knew how to control American Congress. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1805.2s)]
*  He knew how to basically play ball with the Americans. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1814.2s)]
*  The other big selling point for the United States is the U.S. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1818.2s)]
*  Now that fell apart on October 7, but he's been able to basically restore pieces of that by doing this endless unlimited [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1822.2s)]
*  bloodshed campaign. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1852.2s)]
*  Donald Trump has given Benjamin Benjamin Netanyahu the opportunity to restore the unlimited genocide now by coming out yesterday and saying, listen, if Hamas doesn't release all of the hostages, all 76, including the bodies, then Israel can go back and say, fuck the ceasefire deal. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1853.2s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1875.2s)]
*  Now it's up to Benjamin Netanyahu to say, no, we don't want all 76. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1876.2s)]
*  We just want to maintain the current ceasefire agreement or to say, yeah, Trump gave me the go ahead and we're just going to, you know, I'm going to follow through on an ultimatum. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1880.2s)]
*  Netanyahu as of two hours ago says, I have just finished an in-depth four hour security cabinet meeting. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1888.2s)]
*  We all express outrage over the shocking state of our three hostages who were released last Saturday. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1895.2s)]
*  Netanyahu says he passed the unanimous decision in the security cabinet. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1900.2s)]
*  If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will be terminated and the IDF will resume intense fighting against the U.S. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1903.2s)]
*  The IDF will resume intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1909.2s)]
*  Ironic because the statement here basically is if we don't get the hostages back during the ceasefire, then we're just going to kill the hostages. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1912.2s)]
*  That's what he's saying. He's just like, yeah, we're going to we're going to murder them. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1921.2s)]
*  We're going to murder all the remaining alive hostages. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1924.2s)]
*  Yeah. Eddie Cohn posted this is weird, but shows Israeli attitude to the relations. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1926.2s)]
*  The real leader in the Blue House. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1933.2s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's it's not wrong. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1935.2s)]
*  They also gave Israel Moab missiles so they can use it to so they can use it to scare off Iran. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1937.2s)]
*  Yeah. Why would he murder the hostages? Not baiting right now. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1942.2s)]
*  What do you mean? It's it's already Israeli military doctrine to murder the hostages. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1946.2s)]
*  The previous defense, the previous defense minister, you have Golan openly admitted that on October 7, they implemented the the the Hannibal the Hannibal protocol, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1950.2s)]
*  which is the Hannibal doctrine, which is literally the the standing Israeli military directive that if if Hamas or any sort of militancy is actually taking Israeli hostages, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1962.2s)]
*  it's better to just kill the Israeli hostages and not let them use the Israeli hostages as a as a leverage point. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1976.2s)]
*  He also said he also openly admitted that, yes, Israel followed through on this process on October 7. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1984.2s)]
*  He said Israel killed Israeli hostages that were being taken hostage by Hamas on October 7. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1991.2s)]
*  There are plenty of people currently in the Israeli government that openly say that the hostages are a hurdle. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=1999.2s)]
*  It's a more bang, you're being one of them like they'll just straight up say it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2007.2s)]
*  They'll be like, yeah, the hostages are a nuisance. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2011.2s)]
*  They're annoying. We have military goals here, which is, you know, full, full tilt ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip and the pesky Israeli citizens who are immediate family members and friends of these hostages that are still in Gaza want them to return alive. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2013.2s)]
*  And that's really annoying because, you know, it makes it it makes it politically less advantageous to continue to continue doing ethnic cleansing in Gaza when the ultimate goal is to do ethnic cleansing in Gaza. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2030.2s)]
*  After the past 16 months, I think everyone can understand that the only thing Israel responds to is force. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2044.2s)]
*  That's it. Here is the Yair Lapid, the so-called Israeli opposition, by the way. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2055.2s)]
*  The Israeli government must bring everyone home. There is nothing more important than that. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2061.2s)]
*  There is nothing more urgent than that. The hostages have no time. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2065.2s)]
*  Hamas is a despicable terrorist organization that will do anything to harm the hostages in Israel. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2067.2s)]
*  We have no expectations for Hamas. The responsibility lies with Netanyahu, who is again delaying, again, harming the process, again, abandoning the kidnapped. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2070.2s)]
*  He doesn't need to be afraid of Smotrich. He has a safety net to bring the kidnapped back home. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2078.2s)]
*  Please don't say force law. Israel is eye for eye. They respond to harm. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2082.2s)]
*  No bias. You do be fair in reading most people's comments. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2086.2s)]
*  No, Israel has shown time and time again that diplomacy with Israel is not the way to go. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2090.2s)]
*  That is what they've taught every single regional actor. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2095.2s)]
*  That is a lesson, a dangerous lesson that they've taught every single regional actor. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2098.2s)]
*  The only time the only time they back down or the only time when they actually respond with limited retaliation is if they think that this will harm them personally. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2103.2s)]
*  Think about it with Iran. Think about what Israel's retaliation to Iran looks like versus what Israel's retaliation to Gaza looks like. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2116.2s)]
*  As a matter of fact, anytime Israel feels like they have gotten fucked over, OK, with any kind of military militant resistance, they end up going back and punishing the civilian population of Gaza. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2126.2s)]
*  That's the only thing they know. The only thing they know is harming civilians, women and children. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2140.2s)]
*  That's it. Think about Israel's actions in southern Lebanon and how quickly they packed up the southern Lebanon, the southern Lebanon invasion. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2147.2s)]
*  Why did they do that? Because they had to go against a standing military force. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2158.2s)]
*  OK, Hezbollah is the standing military force in southern Lebanon and in Lebanon in general. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2163.2s)]
*  And while they assassinated through acts of terror, a big part of the Hezbollah leadership, including, you know, first responders that also happen to be using the same pagers. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2171.2s)]
*  OK, and and assassinating a shit ton of civilians in the process by taking out entire city blocks in Beirut. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2183.2s)]
*  Hezbollah was still standing and mounted a significant defense against the Israeli incursion. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2192.2s)]
*  And obviously, they they did not have the same ease that they did inside of the Gaza Strip in southern Lebanon. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2199.2s)]
*  Why? Because people were actually fighting back. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2210.2s)]
*  Also, Hamas is capable of hearing what Trump is saying as well. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2213.2s)]
*  This was their response to Trump's statements, a call for ethnic cleansing in a statement published on his Telegram channel. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2218.2s)]
*  Hamas rejected President President Donald Trump's insistence on the US taking over Gaza and transferring two million Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2223.2s)]
*  It's true. You can say, oh, Hamas, those are the bad guys. Those are terrorists. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2231.2s)]
*  But it's still true. It doesn't change that reality at all. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2235.2s)]
*  OK, saying that you want to forcibly relocate two million people, two million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip is a call for ethnic displacement. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2239.2s)]
*  It is genocide. OK, it is a direct call for genocide. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2251.2s)]
*  I don't know what more you can say in this process for people to understand it. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2256.2s)]
*  The very fact that people are not more alarmed by Donald Trump's very open, active calls for genocide, the very fact that there aren't people going, what the hell are you saying? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2263.2s)]
*  This is definitionally, legally the standard for ethnic cleansing. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2274.2s)]
*  You are advocating for ethnic cleansing by simply saying it's a mass relocation program. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2278.2s)]
*  The very fact that people just don't lose their minds at this is shocking. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2284.2s)]
*  But I guess we have gotten very used to this kind of thing after the last 16 months. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2289.2s)]
*  Aiden, the Israelis have denied that. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2298.2s)]
*  And now, of course, we have the statement from Benjamin Netanyahu, who you can see there with Donald Trump recently. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2302.2s)]
*  So that's the latest from the office of the prime minister. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2312.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rRYCaTlQk&t=2319.2s)]
