**HasanAbi:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk)
*  of reality. Okay, it's elusive. It's no longer a reality. We [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=0.0s)]
*  need more houses so we can fix the goddamn housing market so [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=5.48s)]
*  that rent prices come down. The rent is too damn high. Earlier [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=9.76s)]
*  today gave an interview to a a singular a singular a single [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=20.72s)]
*  sit down interview to local local Philadelphia action news. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=25.92s)]
*  Okay, how was the policy less she literally outlined policies [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  Oh my god. Liba phonics dial it back please. Okay. Okay. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=35.24s)]
*  Okay. Wonderful. Good. Awesome. Madam Vice President. Pleasure [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=40.64s)]
*  to meet you. Thanks for your time. Our audience appreciate [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  your time. Of course. As you know, we're sitting here in a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=47.64s)]
*  state and arguably in front of an audience that 54 days from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=51.160000000000004s)]
*  could decide the outcome of this presidential election. You hear [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=54.92s)]
*  it more than I do. People want to know more about you and about [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  your specific plans. At the debate the other night, you [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=62.56s)]
*  talked about creating an opportunity economy. I wonder if [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=65.76s)]
*  we can drill down on that a little bit. When we talk about [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=68.48s)]
*  bringing down prices and making life more affordable for people. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=71.16s)]
*  What are one or two specific things you have in mind for [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  that? Well, I'll start with this. I grew up a middle class [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=77.8s)]
*  kid. My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=81.48s)]
*  She was able to finally save up enough money to buy our first [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  house when I was a teenager. I grew up in a community of hard [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=90.26s)]
*  working people, you know, construction workers and nurses [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=93.84s)]
*  and teachers. And I try to explain to some people who may [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=97.2s)]
*  not have had the same experience, you know, if it but a lot of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  people will relate to this. You know, I grew up in a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  neighborhood of folks who are very proud of their lawn, you [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=106.76s)]
*  know, and, and I was raised to believe and to know that all [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=109.48s)]
*  people deserve dignity and that we as Americans have a beautiful [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=115.56s)]
*  character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=120.84s)]
*  This reads as like, to maybe not as bad as like Hillary Clinton [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=125.64s)]
*  in general, but like, too much too much space, too much filler [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=130.12s)]
*  is harder than a goddamn. This is harder than a goddamn toe [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=135.08s)]
*  filler episode, because they caught up to the original manga [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=139.96s)]
*  type. You know what I mean? Anyway, you have an economy of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=143.16s)]
*  words, you have a finite amount of time, if you are seemingly [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=147.6s)]
*  running out the clock, people are going to get annoyed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=151.72s)]
*  But not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=155.56s)]
*  help them fuel those dreams and ambitions. So when I talk about [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=165.68s)]
*  investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=170.8s)]
*  work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=175.36s)]
*  for people, for example, to start a small business. My mother, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  you know, worked long hours and our neighbor helped raise us. We [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=181.88s)]
*  used to call her it was I still call her our second mother. She [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  was a small business owner. I love our small business owners. I [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=188.84s)]
*  learned who they are from my childhood. And she was [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=192.08s)]
*  I will once again ask the question, who do you think? What [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=195.88000000000002s)]
*  do you think is the larger number of voters in totality, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=198.96s)]
*  people who own small businesses, people want to start small [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  businesses, or people who work for small businesses or just [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  work in general, before you say, Oh, this is for Philadelphia. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=210.12s)]
*  That same principle holds in Philadelphia as well. Okay, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  Pennsylvania is not like, you know, outside of the bounds of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=217.48s)]
*  reality, where there's just magically more small business [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  owners and small business owners, and people who want to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=225.72s)]
*  start small businesses, then actual people who currently have [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  issues with the economy. Okay, not everyone can be a small [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=234.92s)]
*  business owner. Why don't they get that? It's just it's just [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=238.64s)]
*  silly. Wouldn't this be better if she framed as supporting [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=241.88s)]
*  small businesses will create jobs and help employees make more [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=244.24s)]
*  money? Not necessarily true. But wasn't that sound better? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=246.52s)]
*  No, what she should do is say, we want to expand social safety [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=249.08s)]
*  nets in this country to help American workers who have for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  far too long been sold out by both parties. Okay, this will [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  also obviously improve the standing of small businesses and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=267.92s)]
*  the American industrial force as a power player in the global [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=273.12s)]
*  economy. Because as my vice presidential candidate, Tim [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=277.04s)]
*  Waltz, coach Waltz, expertly showed in the beautiful state of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=282.24s)]
*  Minnesota, when you pass with slim margins, a bill that offers [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=287.4s)]
*  paid family leave, small businesses also get to compete [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=296.12s)]
*  with big businesses that have generated a lot more revenue and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=302.64s)]
*  can offer these amenities at ease. This way, small businesses [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  no longer have to worry about certain health care costs, or [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=313.96s)]
*  certain costs of operating the business in terms of their [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=318.68s)]
*  workers, because we will take care of that. This is how you [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=321.88s)]
*  institute market reform and make the American economy more [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  competitive overall. That way you present a pro working class [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=331.0s)]
*  message that literally expands to the broadest demographics. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=335.28s)]
*  And on top of that, you present your argument in a way that also [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=339.96s)]
*  helps small businesses, but she's not doing that. Because her [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=344.56s)]
*  policy prescriptions are not actually focused on the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=347.96s)]
*  broadest demographic of Americans, Americans who are [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=351.32s)]
*  wage laborers, okay. 1099 employees, or W2 employees [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=355.84s)]
*  doesn't matter playing in imagination land. No, what I'm [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  describing isn't some communist idea either comrade Perry. This [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  is like super simple, like 19, let's say 1960s Democratic Party [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  messaging. Okay, this is just New Deal Democrat messaging. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=376.84s)]
*  Okay, if you are actually a New Deal Democrat, then this is what [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=381.84s)]
*  you would say this is super basic, but we have by way of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=385.64s)]
*  third way politics and Reaganomics and neoliberalism as [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=389.36s)]
*  a whole. Okay, completely gutted that aspect. I didn't make a [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=393.44s)]
*  bold declaration to just like, undermine the the entire [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  capitalist hegemonic status. I am simply saying, you should [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=405.08s)]
*  expand on social safety nets. You shouldn't be afraid to push [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=410.84s)]
*  for social safety nets and expansion of social safety nets. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=415.0s)]
*  And while you're doing that, you can present it as an argument [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=418.44s)]
*  that is also beneficial for small businesses, because it is [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=422.04s)]
*  beneficial for small businesses. The problem with your thinking [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=425.6s)]
*  that our small businesses owners are simply our swing voters and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=428.36s)]
*  working class people already voting Democratic. No, you just [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=431.6s)]
*  made that up. You made that up. You made that up in your mind, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=434.92s)]
*  you're saying small business voters are owners or swing [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=439.18s)]
*  voters. And what you're trying to say as swing voters is you're [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=441.84s)]
*  trying to say that they're right wing. Okay, they're right wing, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=445.64s)]
*  but with a proclivity to vote for the liberal. Okay, what does [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=449.11999999999995s)]
*  that mean? What does a swing voter mean in the way that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=453.76s)]
*  you're trying to use it? I also said that messaging around small [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=456.35999999999996s)]
*  businesses by pushing for policies that help everyone and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=460.84s)]
*  then saying this also helps small businesses still arrives at [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=465.88s)]
*  the same point that is pro small business. Interesting that that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=469.6s)]
*  favorite centrist pollster blueprint blueprint, I think not [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=474.32000000000005s)]
*  blueprinting found that three worst messages from the Harris [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=478.72s)]
*  on the night were one how great the border security bill was to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=481.40000000000003s)]
*  the tax deduction for small businesses and three the vow to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=484.68s)]
*  not ban fracking. I rest my case. I rest my case. Here is the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=487.24s)]
*  empirical evidence to show exactly what I'm telling you. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=493.56s)]
*  When I tell you when it's happening in the moment, it's a [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=497.92s)]
*  prediction. This is no longer a prediction. This is just a fact. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=500.72s)]
*  Okay, I love our small businesses. My plan is to give [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  $50,000 in tax deduction to start up small businesses [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=509.56s)]
*  knowing they're a part of the backbone of the American [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=512.64s)]
*  economy 39% polling, I will not ban fracking 31% the United [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=514.48s)]
*  States Congress, including some of the most conservative [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=520.04s)]
*  members of the United States came up with a border security [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=521.92s)]
*  bill, which I supported 42%. Let's look at some other ones. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=523.88s)]
*  We need a president who actually brings up thousand of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=528.04s)]
*  perspective that is about lifting people up and not people [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=529.88s)]
*  beating not beating people down. Great message. Great message. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=531.7199999999999s)]
*  It's not policy, but it actually shows the clear cut differences [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=535.56s)]
*  between Donald Trump and herself. I do believe that the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=538.76s)]
*  vast majority of us know we have so much more in common than [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=541.7199999999999s)]

*  housing units in a place like Los Angeles, versus how many [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1019.0s)]
*  homeless people are there in comparison to Wyoming, which is [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1022.2s)]

*  You talk at the debate and at previous appearances about [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1184.28s)]
*  turning the page on the past and in fact here today in John's [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1187.84s)]
*  town, you're talking about a new way forward. I think some people [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1191.52s)]
*  have a question, given maybe your current role as Vice [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1194.84s)]
*  President of the United States, how different you are from Joe [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1197.6799999999998s)]
*  Biden. And so I wonder if there are one or two spots, policy [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1201.52s)]
*  areas or approaches where you would say, I'm a different [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1205.28s)]
*  person. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1208.36s)]
*  Well, I'm obviously not Joe Biden. And, you know, I offer a [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1209.6399999999999s)]
*  new generation of leadership. And so for example, thinking [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1214.6799999999998s)]
*  about developing and creating an opportunity economy where it's [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1218.32s)]
*  about investing in areas that really need a lot of work, and [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1223.32s)]
*  maybe focusing on, again, the aspirations and the dreams, but [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1229.36s)]
*  also just recognizing that at this moment in time, some of the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1233.52s)]
*  stuff we could take for granted years ago, we can't take for [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1236.4399999999998s)]
*  granted anymore. For example, another plan that I have that is [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1239.32s)]
*  a new approach is to expand the child tax credit to $6,000 for [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1244.0s)]
*  young families for the first year of their child's life. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1249.88s)]
*  Because that is obviously a very critical stage of development of [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1253.0800000000002s)]
*  a child. And a lot of young parents need the help to buy a [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1257.0800000000002s)]
*  car seat or [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1261.1200000000001s)]
*  this is, this is actually a really, really great graph that [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1263.3200000000002s)]
*  chatter brought forward that actually kind of corresponds to [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1269.0800000000002s)]
*  the point I'm making, in terms of like housing availability, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1272.88s)]
*  like vacant units versus homelessness. So if you look at [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1276.8s)]
*  like the top 20 cities, where you have the highest ratio of [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1283.1599999999999s)]
*  vacant homes to people experiencing homelessness, number [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1288.96s)]
*  one is Detroit. Number two is Syracuse, New York. Number three [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1291.76s)]
*  is St. Louis. Okay. Number four is Lakeland, Florida. Now, when [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1296.3999999999999s)]
*  you look at this, when you look at this ratio of available [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1301.8799999999999s)]
*  units to homelessness, okay, you immediately recognize you [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1306.48s)]
*  immediately recognize one thing. Okay, why is it ordered like [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1311.84s)]
*  that? I don't know. With the exception of Chicago, Illinois. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1315.56s)]
*  Okay. A lot of these places are places where like industry is [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1319.88s)]
*  left. They're still there used to be life there. There used to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1323.64s)]
*  be a city there. There used to actively be people living there. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1327.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. But it's no longer like a very densely populated area. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1331.32s)]
*  And there's still a shit ton of homelessness there, even though [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1336.92s)]
*  there is a lot, a lot of vacant properties. But when you [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1340.1200000000001s)]
*  recognize when you recognize, like places like Los Angeles, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1345.88s)]
*  California don't have that same level of readily available [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1349.68s)]
*  housing in comparison to the number of homeless people, that [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1353.0s)]
*  is one because there's a ton of homeless people and two, not as [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1355.64s)]
*  much readily available vacant housing. So this is why I always [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1358.8s)]
*  say this is why I always say this is a two parter. There's [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1363.0s)]
*  certain aspects that people immediately cast aside as like [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1367.24s)]
*  NIMBYism or whatever. That is true. There are vacant [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1369.92s)]
*  properties. There are far more vacant properties in this [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1374.12s)]
*  country than there are homeless people. Okay. But in terms of [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1377.04s)]
*  like, in terms of looking at high density urban areas, okay, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1381.44s)]
*  there needs to be more readily available housing units. That's [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1387.24s)]
*  where a lot of the homelessness happens. And a big part of the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1390.0s)]
*  reason why there's a lot of homelessness there is a direct [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1393.0s)]
*  consequence of not having higher density housing available. Okay, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1395.92s)]
*  that's it. Ultimately, though, this problem completely stems [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1400.52s)]
*  from treating every single homeowner treating their house [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1404.76s)]
*  as not a is not a place for shelter, but instead a place for [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1408.88s)]
*  shelter and also an investment vehicle. Okay, your house is [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1413.08s)]
*  your asset that you can leverage against your house is what you [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1419.3999999999999s)]
*  purchase your house which you borrow money against. Okay, your [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1423.12s)]
*  house is your nest egg. Your house is your retirement. Your [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1427.48s)]
*  house is the only way that you can generate generational wealth [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1432.1599999999999s)]
*  in this country. Okay, you get it. That is part of the reason [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1434.68s)]
*  why big businesses have been able to completely capture this [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1438.8799999999999s)]
*  marketplace, overtake it and use many of the policies that have [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1441.8s)]
*  been implemented for years and years in an effort to make it [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1445.6s)]
*  easier to purchase a home and keep that home into a system [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1448.12s)]
*  that is fundamentally broken. That's why the idea for a lot of [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1454.2399999999998s)]
*  people is that like your value is never supposed to go down. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1458.6399999999999s)]
*  It's all it's always supposed to go up. No one actually treats it [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1461.28s)]
*  like an investment. You get that you get to have your cake and [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1465.1999999999998s)]
*  eat it too. In the United States of America, you get to have your [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1468.28s)]
*  cake and eat it too. Your house is your place of shelter, but [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1472.8s)]
*  it's also your capacity to generate generational wealth. So [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1476.0s)]
*  all of a sudden, it's not just shelter, but it's also an [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1481.6s)]
*  investment vehicle. Okay, what do you mean? I purchased this [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1483.8s)]
*  house, if the price goes down, you're not my bag. That is the [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1487.44s)]
*  problem. This is why I always say we have to decommodify [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1490.24s)]
*  housing. We have to decouple the idea that housing is a means of [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1494.44s)]
*  generating income, passive income. Okay, that's it. Because [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1499.56s)]
*  if we were to simply treat it as a mechanism for investment, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1504.32s)]
*  you'd go sucks to suck dog. What do you mean? Like, okay, your [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1507.84s)]
*  value went down. What are we talking about here? Yeah, you [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1511.8799999999999s)]
*  made a purchase, you treated it like an investment, and then [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1515.52s)]
*  your investment didn't pan out. Like that's the name of the [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1520.0s)]
*  game. Why the for you gambling? But of course, you could never [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1522.6399999999999s)]

*  authoritarian measures that aren't necessarily authoritarian [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1529.32s)]
*  on principle, but would be treated as authoritarian by [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1532.56s)]
*  Americans. For example, if a law passes, where you actually do [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1535.0s)]
*  move towards the commodifying housing, you don't have to do [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1540.2s)]
*  town halls on it. If a law passes on a ballot measure, for [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1543.56s)]

*  building new additional housing units or building a homeless [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1551.52s)]

*  of people off guard, maybe a bit by surprise in the debate the [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1672.24s)]
*  other night when you mentioned that you are a gun owner. I know [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1675.3200000000002s)]
*  you said it in 2019 as well. We're talking about your values [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1677.2s)]
*  on this issue. When it comes to gun ownership, we're okay, that [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1680.88s)]
*  was two for two, man. That was ass cheeks in terms of [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1684.48s)]
*  responding. Like her answers were asked, this is not going to [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1687.2s)]
*  be good. This is not going to read well. chatters. Stop [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1691.2s)]

*  watching Hassan on the weekend yourself chatter, do we need to [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1700.04s)]

*  Hassan on the weekend? Are you okay? chatters like this is my [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1707.8s)]
*  cry for help. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1711.1599999999999s)]
*  Do you draw the line in America on gun ownership and gun use? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1712.24s)]
*  Well, like you said, Brian, I am a gun owner and Tim walls, my [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1717.28s)]
*  running mate is also a gun owner. We're not taking anybody's [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1721.04s)]
*  guns away. I support the Second Amendment. And I support [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1723.48s)]
*  reasonable gun safety laws. Part of my approach to this is I was [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1727.64s)]
*  a career prosecutor for most of my career. I have personally [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1733.6000000000001s)]
*  prosecuted homicide cases. I have personally looked at [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1736.64s)]
*  autopsies. I have personally seen what assault weapons do to [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1740.5200000000002s)]
*  the human body. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1745.8400000000001s)]
*  They started a poster there. Who are you watching this weekend [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1746.88s)]
*  tweet? They usually do guess this shadow took a person that [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1749.0400000000002s)]
*  you were listening to tweet. Oh, God, I hate it. I hate it when [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1751.3600000000001s)]
*  Dixerto mentions my name because it just like brings the [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1754.56s)]
*  crazies in here so aggressively. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1758.28s)]
*  And so I feel very strongly that it is consistent with the Second [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1761.96s)]
*  Amendment and your right to own a gun to also say we need an [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1767.6399999999999s)]
*  assault weapons ban. They're literally tools of war. They [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1771.6399999999999s)]
*  were literally designed to a lot of human beings quickly. I say [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1775.1599999999999s)]
*  we need universal background checks. The majority of NRA [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1779.6799999999998s)]
*  members support that. Why? Because it's just reasonable. You [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1782.68s)]
*  just might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1786.52s)]
*  If they've been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1791.72s)]
*  others. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1794.88s)]
*  This is like probably the strongest she is on on all three [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1795.3200000000002s)]
*  of the questions so far. Again, not enough Riz. But she's right. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1799.2s)]
*  She just might want to know. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1803.68s)]
*  Two final questions if I might on the appeal of the man you were [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1805.76s)]
*  running against. She drove here today you likely saw a lot of [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1808.8400000000001s)]
*  Trump signs. He has an historic appeal in this country. And as [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1811.52s)]
*  you are someone running against him and try to understand that, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1816.24s)]
*  I wonder how you distill it. What do you understand his appeal [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1820.8799999999999s)]
*  to be and how do you speak to his voters or maybe people who [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1824.2s)]
*  just share his values but are open to something else? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1827.84s)]
*  I based on experience and and a lived experience. No, in my [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1830.92s)]
*  heart, I know in my soul, I know that the vast majority of us as [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1838.88s)]
*  Americans have so much more in common than what separates us. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1843.5600000000002s)]
*  And I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1846.48s)]
*  Americans [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1851.44s)]
*  Yeah, question for chatters in here that always are like, No, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1852.8400000000001s)]
*  you don't understand. She's actually popping off on this or [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1856.1200000000001s)]
*  No, you don't understand. She's actually popping off on that. Is [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1858.3200000000002s)]
*  she popping off on this for you? Not for not for some like [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1860.8000000000002s)]
*  undecided mythical voter that you hallucinated that is going to [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1865.3200000000002s)]
*  be really responsive to the things that she's saying. But [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1868.6s)]
*  instead, like, does this does any of this should appeal to you [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1872.08s)]
*  or anyone that you know, want a leader who brings us together as [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1875.32s)]
*  Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1879.36s)]
*  trying to have us point our finger. Honestly, as she seems [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1884.1999999999998s)]
*  calm and normal, and like she might try and do stuff. Still not [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1886.8s)]
*  swung to vote for her yet though, because of Gaza. I love [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1890.6399999999999s)]
*  that. I put my Frank Luntz cap on for a second. Okay. I love [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1893.7199999999998s)]
*  when I hear from chatters who are like, Listen, I like the [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1897.52s)]
*  vibes. Okay, but also I don't like that she's facilitating it. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1900.52s)]
*  So I'm probably not going to vote for her. But I like the [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1905.28s)]
*  vibes overall fingers at each other. I think people are [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1907.2s)]
*  exhausted with that approach. To be honest, I don't think the [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1909.92s)]
*  mythical voters on the house and I've been sure No, of course [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1912.12s)]
*  not because they don't exist chatter. That's what I'm saying. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1914.6s)]
*  Remember what I told you? Every American voter, okay, and non [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1917.84s)]
*  voter as well has like five immediate priorities. And you [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1922.92s)]
*  can look at that list as a hierarchy of need, right? Every [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1927.4s)]
*  American has this every human has this right immediate [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1933.24s)]
*  priorities. And if you want to capture the broadest segment of [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1936.76s)]
*  society, you got to look at what their priorities are, not by [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1944.4s)]
*  people who are responding to polls necessarily or like what [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1948.1200000000001s)]
*  issue do you think the Democrats should be covering but like, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1951.4s)]

*  people's material conditions, rent and cost of living is a [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1959.0800000000002s)]
*  massive priority for the broadest subsects of the [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1964.64s)]
*  American population. Okay, if you honestly look at that, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1968.88s)]
*  recognize it, prioritize it, put forward clear cut policy [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1975.24s)]
*  prescriptions prescriptions to this issue. Okay, you will be [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1980.36s)]
*  able to capture the attention of a lot of people you have to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1985.56s)]
*  also obviously make them believe that you care about the [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1988.36s)]
*  Okay, but that's it. Like politics is as simple or as [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=1996.1599999999999s)]
*  difficult as you make it. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2000.4399999999998s)]
*  I think people want a leader who has common sense and tries to [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2005.04s)]
*  find common ground. I'm supported by over 200 [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2009.88s)]
*  Republicans who worked for both presidents Bush, John McCain [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2012.68s)]

*  Cheney, Congress, former Congress member Liz Cheney. And [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2021.72s)]
*  I think people are more in light of the the hate and division [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2025.5200000000002s)]
*  that we see coming out of Donald Trump to say, hey, let's let's [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2032.5600000000002s)]

*  And finally, as you introduce yourself to America in a new [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2055.2799999999997s)]
*  way, they've heard much of your story at the Democratic National [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2057.68s)]
*  Convention in in that debate earlier this week, if there's [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2060.6s)]
*  one thing that you would about who Kamala Harris is that you [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2063.48s)]
*  don't think they know yet. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2068.0s)]
*  Dog with that be George W. Bush famously beat okay, famously [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2069.88s)]
*  beat both out well they didn't beat out or but you know, he [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2075.96s)]
*  stole the election from Al Gore and beat john Kerry in 2000 and [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2079.68s)]
*  in 2004. Okay. George W. Bush's vice president was Cheney the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2083.84s)]
*  one state that George W. Bush didn't beat Al Gore or didn't [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2089.48s)]
*  beat john Kerry in despite the fact that he actually won the [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2095.72s)]
*  election was the state of you might have guessed where I'm [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2099.7999999999997s)]
*  going with this. Pennsylvania. Okay, not Transylvania, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2103.8799999999997s)]
*  Pennsylvania. Okay, PA PA. You are talking to Philadelphians and [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2108.9199999999996s)]
*  Pennsylvanians. Okay, that's who you're talking to with this. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2117.68s)]
*  That's who you are talking to with this conversation. Why are [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2122.36s)]
*  you bringing up an unfavorable person who doesn't even have a [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2128.16s)]
*  constituency in the Republican Party, but never won [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2133.2799999999997s)]
*  Pennsylvania anyway, even when he was the vice president, there [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2138.12s)]
*  is no good reason to invoke the name of Richard Cheney. When you [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2143.56s)]
*  are trying to win Pennsylvania, look to the issues that [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2152.48s)]
*  Pennsylvanian voters care about and try to win them over. Stop [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2157.48s)]
*  running to the bottom. Stop running scared. Stop imagining [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2164.2s)]
*  some weird like neoliberal centrist Pennsylvanian out there [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2169.7200000000003s)]
*  who's like, well, I really want a reasonable person who's gonna [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2174.32s)]
*  bring back to war to the past that I despised and never really [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2177.6800000000003s)]
*  voted for. And I did vote for Donald Trump after I never [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2181.1600000000003s)]
*  really voted for George W. Bush. And also Donald Trump literally [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2184.96s)]
*  ran against George W. Bush and made Hillary Clinton look like [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2188.28s)]
*  George W. Bush. But actually now I'm going to change my mind and [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2191.6000000000004s)]
*  vote for the person who George W. Bush's vice president the demon [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2194.76s)]
*  himself endorsed. Who is this far? Who? Who? You might as well [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2198.16s)]
*  talk about Victor Norban. At least they don't know who the [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2205.44s)]
*  he is. And he sounds like a like a villain from a comic book. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2208.2s)]
*  Why are they so stupid? Why? Why are they so stupid? It's like, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2212.68s)]
*  like, like you want to win, right? You want to win, right? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2219.44s)]
*  Like you don't want to lose. You want to win. You want to win [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2222.44s)]
*  with like the narratives possible. You want to win with [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2224.92s)]
*  the policies possible. You want to win by pushing neoliberal [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2227.48s)]
*  policies. Fine. But you still don't have to mention Cheney [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2232.16s)]
*  endorsing you. That's not like, that's not a thing. That's not [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2236.28s)]
*  a thing that voters care about. How far is your head stuck up [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2239.2400000000002s)]
*  your own asshole to think that like normal Americans are like, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2244.28s)]
*  oh my god, Cheney, Cheney is endorsing her? Well, by God, I [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2248.72s)]
*  never voted for him. And I voted for the guy who positioned [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2253.64s)]
*  himself against Cheney. But now I'm gonna actually swing in the [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2257.32s)]
*  other direction. Most people at this point either don't know who [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2260.6000000000004s)]
*  the Cheney is, or they do not remember him fondly. The [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2265.04s)]
*  broadest majorities of the American population have [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2270.44s)]
*  recognized the Iraq war as an abject failure. Okay, that's the [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2274.7200000000003s)]
*  starting point. People either think it's an abject failure, or [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2279.7200000000003s)]
*  their son got their blown off for Cheney. Okay, that's how [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2283.16s)]
*  they remember Cheney as the guy as the guy responsible for why [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2289.16s)]
*  they only have a urn full of their son's ashes. That's what [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2294.64s)]
*  they know Cheney as the guy responsible for that. They don't [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2298.68s)]
*  know Cheney as like some elder statesman that's like really [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2301.44s)]
*  reaching across the aisle like the wrong with you. The last [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2304.7599999999998s)]
*  poll I saw had Cheney at a 13% approval rating on YouGov. Yeah. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2308.08s)]
*  Adolf Hitler endorsed me. Okay, sick. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2312.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I've been probably it's not very different from [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2315.3599999999997s)]

*  favorite things that I lately have not been able to do is [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2323.24s)]
*  Sunday family dinner. I love to cook. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2327.3999999999996s)]
*  I chatters are like, bro, the donor class loves Cheney. No, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2329.44s)]
*  they don't. But even if they did, then say that behind closed [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2332.3199999999997s)]
*  doors at a $500,000 a plate dinner when you're doing a [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2337.7599999999998s)]
*  fundraiser, not at ABC six action news exclusive interview [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2342.0s)]
*  for Philadelphia and voters. Oh my god. Oh my god. It's so [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2348.52s)]
*  stupid. It's so dumb. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2353.68s)]
*  I have incredible friends. My best friend from kindergarten is [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2355.92s)]

*  that really and I said it the other day, you know, as a [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2363.04s)]
*  I don't think mentioning Cheney matters. When you have 11 [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2366.72s)]

*  most likely going to lose and then lose the election to [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2381.64s)]
*  Donald Trump on you probably should be using your time [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2384.16s)]
*  wisely. Stop making excuses for Democratic Party operatives. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2387.88s)]
*  Stop you are not paid by the DNC. And if you are paid by the [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2394.88s)]
*  DNC, you should listen to what I'm saying and then get that [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2399.64s)]

*  career prosecutor, I never asked a victim of were they a [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2419.96s)]
*  Republican or Democrat. The only thing I ever asked them is [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2423.76s)]

*  want regardless of who they voted for in the last election. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCrbwygiAk&t=2431.6800000000003s)]
