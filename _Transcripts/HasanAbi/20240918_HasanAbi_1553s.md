# Trump Is Becoming Increasingly Dangerous | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM)
*  Also, how are you gonna get mad that these people are saying Donald Trump's gonna be a dictator when he said it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=0.0s)]
*  Like, he said it. He was like, I'm gonna be a dictator for one day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=5.48s)]
*  What the hell do you mean? Like... [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=8.84s)]
*  Despite nationwide pleas to cool things down after the second... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=16.84s)]
*  Dude, what can the Democrats do to cool things down further? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=20.48s)]
*  They've already adopted the right-wing framing on a key issue, immigration. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=25.04s)]
*  Okay. They rarely ever talk about how unhinged the Republicans are. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=29.88s)]
*  They've basically become Republicans. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=35.16s)]
*  You just want them to step aside and let the Republican win. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=37.44s)]
*  Like, default. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=40.36s)]
*  Just finished my 12-hour shift at the copper mine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=41.68s)]
*  Thank you for reminding me that I should consider myself lucky and I didn't have an exhausting job of being a streamer. You're welcome. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=44.44s)]
*  This guy is... This guy went from... [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=49.92s)]
*  What about left-wing? Isn't that what you do? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=52.44s)]
*  This guy... This guy literally went from talking about how Israel needs to be led by Christian governments, peaceful Christian governments, to doing old-ass memes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=54.6s)]
*  He's back. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=65.08s)]
*  Also, I already figured out which copper mine you work at, and I've called your foreman, and you have been slacking off of the job. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=65.88s)]
*  Look at this. Since 120, you have not stopped posting in the chat. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=74.2s)]
*  Okay? You've been slacking off. I've already informed your foreman. You're fired now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=79.0s)]
*  Have fun with that back pain. You will no longer get the platinum healthcare. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  ...attempt on Trump. Democrats and the liberal media are right back at it, treating the former president like he's some kind of unique threat. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=88.68s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, never one to miss the spotlight, argues that the media isn't doing enough to... [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=98.04s)]
*  Yeah, the foreman's in here. See? He gets to actually watch the broadcast. You're fired. Sorry, chatter. We're also now going to put you in debtor's prison. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=103.72s)]
*  ...pain Trump is a danger. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=113.08s)]
*  I don't understand why it's so difficult for the press to have a consistent narrative about how dangerous Trump is. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  The object in this case is Donald Trump. His demagoguery... [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=123.24s)]
*  Why? Why is Trump dangerous? I mean it. Sincerely. Why is Donald Trump a danger to the country? Say it out loud. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=127.8s)]
*  Is it the anti-immigrant sentiment, or is it simply that he's not a Democrat? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=137.44s)]
*  His danger to our country and the world. Americans need to understand that they have to take Trump both seriously and literally. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  He has said what he wants to do. He and his allies with Project 2025, his desire to be a dictator. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  Hillary's friends in the media couldn't wait to jump in, quick to twist the story and pin the blame on the GOP and Trump himself for the... [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  ...attempt. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=168.6s)]
*  The Trump campaign is seizing on this apparent attempt as a way to rile up his base. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=169.8s)]
*  ...violent rhetoric in America, in presidential camp. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=174.68s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie. I love how ruthless Libs are. I love how ruthless liberals are sometimes. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=179.24s)]
*  Like liberal media is such...they're such little demons. They're like...they do actually engage in that like passive aggressive so frequently when talking about Trump. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=185.96s)]
*  When they want to be...when they want to be ruthless, they are ruthless. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=197.28s)]
*  Like that's...they're literally like, yeah, Trump is taking advantage of his attempt again. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=201.28s)]
*  Good. I like it. Keep up that energy. All the time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=206.24s)]
*  ...companions. It's been unprecedented since Donald Trump first came onto the scene in 2016. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=210.24s)]
*  The violence is coming from them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=216.0s)]
*  The former president certainly could do a lot to make himself safer. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=218.08s)]
*  Bro, that's crazy. Small amounts of explosives. Yeah, by the way, I have to come clean. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=223.68s)]
*  Me and Ryan Ruth, as the premier...this is so funny because I had this tweet lined up already to talk about it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=228.88s)]
*  Me and Ryan Ruth, you know, defending Taiwan as a Taiwanese foreign legion, actually put together a meeting with Israeli officials around five months ago. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=236.96s)]
*  Where I...where we sent the Israeli parliamentary delegation to Taiwan so that the Taiwanese company Gold Apollo could allow, you know, Semtex to be put inside of the pagers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=247.68s)]
*  I love you, bro. Please stop doing this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=259.68s)]
*  Okay, all jokes aside, though, the pagers Israel exploded were made by Taiwanese company Gold Apollo. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=261.68s)]
*  The pages were reportedly imported five months ago, mid April, 2024, which lines up closely with a kinesis delegation visit to Taiwan, during which Tsai placed a deep in partnership between the two countries. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=266.4s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=276.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the update is that this also calls in the question. There are the China ties. What China ties? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=280.24s)]
*  You mean China ties? This is directly...this calls into question the American State Department being like, this was done without our knowledge. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=288.8s)]
*  You think the Israeli delegation goes to Taiwan and the American government has no idea what they're talking about there? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=296.24s)]
*  Come on, dog. Unless you were doing like, you know, Taiwan is China style commentary here, in which case, you know, something to think about. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  How do they go most though without any of the thousand pages being inspected or maintenance that would have discovered that? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=311.28s)]
*  I guess they did. Seems like this CIA had a heads up at AUB, American University of Beirut Medical Center. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=317.52s)]
*  At a crucial time when AUB MC physicians, nurses, staff, and fully mobilize to deal with the aftermath of today's injuries. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=323.52s)]
*  Several malicious social media outlets have started spreading rumors and conspiracy theories about the types of communication systems AUB has in place, attempting to leak AUB to this tragic event. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=330.0s)]
*  The university categorically denies these baseless allegations. Following are the facts. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  Our paging system infrastructure was upgraded on April 20, 2024. The goal live for switching to the new system took place on August 29th, 2024. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=344.24s)]
*  The scope of this upgrade was to enhance emergency and code communication as several devices and systems had become obsolete. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  Damn, dude, that lines up so perfectly. That's crazy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=363.12s)]
*  The American University of Beirut Medical Center has received over 160 seriously injured individuals over the last three hours with more to come. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=366.79999999999995s)]
*  Our full focus must be on saving lives. Is Lebanon going to sue Motorola now? Why would they sue Motorola? It wasn't even Motorola Pagers. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=372.56s)]
*  It was a Taiwanese company by the name of Gold Apollo that these guys got the Pagers from. It literally doesn't line up. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=379.12s)]
*  This started two weeks ago. The new Pagers were implemented five months ago. No, you're mistaken. The new Pagers were ordered. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=386.64s)]
*  The the new Pagers were ordered like the Israeli strategic planning, the Israeli strategic planning around this incident, according to their own admission was around five months ago. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=393.36s)]
*  Anyway, are you gaming today, big dog? Yes, Donald Trump wants people once Kamala Harris. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=407.44s)]
*  Wait, Donald Lamont is back on CNN. Harris and others to say to stop saying that he is a threat to democracy, then he should stop threatening democracy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=413.6s)]
*  Quit blaming folks until you decide to take a look at what's coming out of your mouth. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=421.76s)]
*  Right now you have a former president who, yes, has been the target of apparent twice, but is also an instigator of political violence. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=428.16s)]
*  All right, Jesse, they've called him Hitler. They say he's dangerous. He's an existential threat. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=437.92s)]
*  And Hillary doesn't understand why it's so difficult for to have a consistent narrative about how dangerous Trump is. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=443.6s)]
*  What does she want a bounty on his head? She does. Fidel Castro. We tried to him dictator Mao Stalin. We fought a cold war against him. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=452.0s)]
*  Mussolini Hitler. We went to World War Two against those guys. Gaddafi Saddam Hussein, two dictators we violently overthrew. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  So when you have a media industrial complex that repeats that this one politician is a dictator, it goes deep into the world. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  The only thing common with like all of those names that you put together, some of which fascists, some of which communists, many of which fought against one another. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=476.56s)]
*  OK, is that they're just all against us. Like that's crazy to say Fidel Castro and Hitler or Fidel Castro and Stalin like or sorry, Hitler and Stalin. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  The American subconscious that sees a dictator as someone that needs to be eliminated and it's in our DNA as an Americans, whether it's a king, an autocrat or a dictator. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=501.52s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that's why everyone's always trying to eliminate MBS. Oh, wait, this is Fox News. You guys give English speaking interviews to MBS. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=513.12s)]
*  No, you don't give a **** about dictators, you idiot. Shut up. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=523.04s)]
*  Want to push them out of power because of what happened in the. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=526.24s)]
*  The only thing that is common here is that America consistently calls all of their enemies dictators and never cares about like dictators that are aligned with them. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=530.16s)]
*  Revolutionary war and you're inviting lost souls looking for a reason to live to want to be a hero, to want to be a savior, to save democracy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=541.28s)]
*  And look at how the media is characterizing this guy, Ryan Ruth. They've called him a crusader for causes they've called. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=551.12s)]
*  Also, how are you going to get mad that these people are saying Donald Trump's going to be a dictator when he said it like he said it? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=559.36s)]
*  He was like, I'm going to be a dictator for one day. What do you mean? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=565.84s)]
*  Like, hold him a super citizen. They've said he has a sense of duty that's apparently driven him. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=569.52s)]
*  Those aren't the things you call. Those are crazy things that should never be associated with a guy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=577.92s)]
*  Now, after the first. OK, but he has aura, man. What are you going to do? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  Like, look at this photo. I'm shocked that people haven't made like fan cams about this dude yet. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=585.88s)]
*  Nation attempt guy was a little opaque. And so Trump said, let's have a moment of unity for this country. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=590.36s)]
*  And even Joe Biden said, let's calm things down. And then they went right back to it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=596.28s)]
*  And then you have a second attempt and Donald Trump's has had it. You get two shots. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=600.52s)]
*  That's enough. And he laid the blame squarely on the left. And instead of having a little bit of self reflection, the left got defensive. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=604.6s)]
*  And they said, no, you're responsible for people trying to yourself. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=612.68s)]
*  And then Don Lemon says basically Trump needs to stop running or else he's going to get more bullets. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=617.2399999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. We are in a danger zone right now, Judge Jeanine. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=625.8s)]
*  And I'm just I'm really, really praying for the health and safety of this president. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=630.28s)]
*  You know, Harold, if Donald Trump's rhetoric is to be blamed for his own attempts, if someone tried to, God forbid, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=634.4399999999999s)]
*  Kamala blaming Trump would be off the table, wouldn't it? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=642.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, he wouldn't be responsible for that, too, would he? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=646.6s)]
*  Yeah. The difference is Donald Trump says violent on a daily basis. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=650.84s)]
*  So do Republican commentators. Democrats don't like that's the problem. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=657.24s)]
*  Like, it doesn't make sense. What do you mean? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=663.72s)]
*  Like, the idea is that like Democrats are running against Republicans. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=667.1600000000001s)]
*  So now Republicans are getting shot at. Like, is that what the argument is? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=671.1600000000001s)]
*  It's ridiculous. It's going to be with you. I don't. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=675.08s)]
*  I don't. Dude, dude, this is happening as there is a national story about like a million threats in Springfield, Ohio. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=678.36s)]
*  After the Republicans put the crosshairs on Springfield, Ohio. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  There is not a single place on the, there's not a single person in the United States that is free of right-wing scrutiny. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=696.1199999999999s)]
*  If the lens of right-wing media is on you, you are going to get death threats. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=705.2399999999999s)]
*  You're going to get swatted. You're going to get threats. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=710.5999999999999s)]
*  That is now just a part of our reality, a part of our political discourse. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=713.4799999999999s)]
*  So for these people to act like stochastic is happening because of the left or because the liberals is so insane, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm melting because I'm losing my mind. It is now, yes, as JD Vance once said, a fact of life. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=725.0s)]
*  And it's crazy. And by the way, chatters, if you think that like you can get away with it, you're wrong. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=733.0s)]
*  Okay. If you get in the crosshairs of the right, they will dox you. They will harass you endlessly. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=737.24s)]
*  And I say that as someone who is in the crosshairs of the right all the time. That's it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=743.4s)]
*  There are people in this chat that know exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=748.6s)]
*  Blame any specific person. I've tried to say over and over again that we live in a time [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=752.44s)]
*  where all of this seems to be being catalyzed and empowered by kind of a circular reinforcing [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=760.28s)]
*  media and social media. I think we live in a time where people are able to say things. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=769.32s)]
*  This guy sucks. He's nowhere near as good as Jessica Tarkov and they just let him run his mouth. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=774.12s)]
*  You know, Wolf Blitzer says that the Trump camp is actually seizing on growing anger. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=779.16s)]
*  It is so annoying. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=784.6s)]
*  Here is already spilling out on the campaign trail, including in new comments by Trump's [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=786.36s)]
*  running mate, JD Vance, where he appears to use what happened in Florida to fire up the supporters. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=790.8399999999999s)]
*  Caitlin. Oh, whoever's helping her, whoever's coaching her, whoever's the puppet master, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=796.6s)]
*  running the strings. Yeah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=804.12s)]
*  You know, we should all call the campaign and say they're from Erie County, Pennsylvania. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=805.48s)]
*  Won't vote for her unless she goes left. No, you should call her and say you're from Erie [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=809.5600000000001s)]
*  County, Pennsylvania and say if she doesn't do NATO, you're not voting for her and just hang up. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=814.76s)]
*  Just do that. That's me. That's my take. If Kamala Harris doesn't do NATO like Brandon did NATO, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=820.68s)]
*  I'm not voting for her. As a matter of fact, even if she does do NATO, I'm still not voting for her. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=826.76s)]
*  Why? Because I'm voting for Joseph Robin at Biden. OK, the real president. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=832.44s)]
*  The current president really up what they did to him. I was one of the 14 million voters. OK, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=837.1600000000001s)]
*  that's right. I'm saying it's an amazing job. They did an amazing job from the moment Biden [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=844.44s)]
*  drops out, forcing Biden to drop out, right? Whatever they're doing, whoever's writing those [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=851.1600000000001s)]
*  speeches, getting her deliver him, coaching her. She's nailing it. She nailed that one speech. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=856.0400000000001s)]
*  She's like, say it to my face. She nailed it, dude. And then also remember the New York Times [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=861.72s)]
*  did a study after 2020 that determined real undecided voters were a myth. Almost everyone [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=868.9200000000001s)]
*  they studied already had selected their vote early. The reason they were undecided is they [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=872.76s)]
*  were undecided why they are voting for that person. So they work backwards to justify it later [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=876.12s)]
*  using what the candidates do slice. And last night to me, when I was like, oh my God, this is [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=881.24s)]
*  Jiu Jitsu where she was like, if you go to his rallies, his crowds are boring. They're tired. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=886.84s)]
*  My crowds are the best crowds. I have the number one crowd. He couldn't help himself. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=892.36s)]
*  And she got him. She baited him on that. She walked him right in. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=897.1600000000001s)]
*  100%. 100%. See, the difference in that debate was not a difference in like, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=900.2s)]
*  who's going to have better policies, who's going to be better for the country. The difference in [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=905.32s)]
*  the debate, the debate, in my opinion, was who was better prepared. She was way better prepared. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=908.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, dude. Trump totally has better policies. I love when people just say this because like [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=915.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris objectively policy list, but it's not like Trump has any policies either. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=919.96s)]
*  What is this idiotic double standard that every smart thinker always posts about? Like they're [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=925.8s)]
*  always chirping about this. Yeah. And even when it came to answering tough questions, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=932.36s)]
*  instead of answering, she would just say things that she believes. Yes, sure. And they sounded [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=938.92s)]
*  real good. And that's the sound bite. That's called being a savvy politician. It's also called [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=944.68s)]
*  being someone who's working with a team versus someone who's like, they said Trump, that deal [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=949.4799999999999s)]
*  was the best deal. They've never seen a deal like this before. They said, how did you put that deal [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=955.56s)]
*  together? People thought that was just brilliant. Yeah, I know. He's not working with a team that's [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=960.04s)]
*  like, I mean, I know he's doing like mock debates. I know he did one with, I think he did one with [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=966.76s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, but someone needs to like tell him like, you've got these tiny little windows, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=970.68s)]
*  and you should have all the words ready for those windows. He started out no repeating things. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=977.4799999999999s)]
*  Cole would have never happened if Trump was president as fire, bro. Do you really need to [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=984.28s)]
*  run so many ads? You're already a millionaire. I'm trying to learn about leftist policies and [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=988.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm inundated assaulted by capitalist framing and societal conditioning. Jesus Christ. I'm a [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=992.1999999999999s)]
*  capitalist. I love capitalism. Capitalism is when you run ads. Socialism is when no ad. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=999.08s)]
*  The friend who's too woke. Yeah. Shut up nerd. Any question? Why do you shit on NATO so hard? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1004.36s)]
*  Is it the Western imperialism? Are there other reasons? Excuse me. You are talking to the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1010.12s)]
*  only eligible NATO voter right now because the last NATO voter is now in federal prison. Okay. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1014.6800000000001s)]
*  How dare you? How dare you, sir? How dare you come here and tell me that I found NATO so hard? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1021.1600000000001s)]
*  I love NATO and the Nazi generals that were in charge of it, that Americans put into positions [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1028.6s)]
*  of power and also all the fascist groups that they all the fascist groups that they that they [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1035.24s)]
*  worked with in Western Europe and also in Turkey. I love the ultra nationalist gray wolves that were [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1041.08s)]
*  propped up by NATO to operate as a right-wing paramilitary death squad in my country. Okay. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1048.12s)]
*  I love that. I'm a fan of that. I'm a radical NATOist and that's why I'm voting for Biden. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1055.24s)]
*  And then Huey Burns is in Michigan where the former president will campaign today. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1061.48s)]
*  Caitlin, good morning. And good morning to you, Nate. Well, the former president is not changing [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1065.16s)]
*  any plans and he is continuing his campaign as usual, but he is adding to his messaging, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1070.1200000000001s)]
*  blaming vice president Kamala Harris for what happened on Sunday. On Monday, the former president [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1076.04s)]
*  said that Harris and president Biden's rhetoric is quote, causing me to be shot at and his [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1083.0s)]
*  running mate, JD Vance, echoed that sentiment while on the campaign trail in Georgia yesterday. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1089.08s)]
*  But you know, the big difference between conservatives and liberals is that we have, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1094.92s)]
*  no one has tried to Kamala Harris. I have some Afghanis that might have a cool idea for you. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1099.48s)]
*  Yes. I've been in contact with Ryan. He put me in contact with the 1000 NATO trained Afghan soldiers [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1105.48s)]
*  and I'm sending them to, okay. I'm sending them that we're doing NATOing as in Palestine is now, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1113.08s)]
*  historic Palestine is now a part of NATO. Okay. I'm sending those guys into the last couple of [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1120.92s)]
*  months and two people now have tried to Donald Trump in the last couple of months. I'd say that's [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1127.08s)]
*  pretty strong evidence that the left needs to tone down the rhetoric and needs to cut this crap out. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1131.8s)]
*  Now, Biden and Harris have denounced the violence and Harris said everyone must do [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1137.56s)]
*  their part to make sure this incident doesn't lead to the people in my DSA meeting said, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1142.6s)]
*  you're a fake list leftist. That's so funny. Oh no, I lost the DSA vote, dude. Did they do that in [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1147.1599999999999s)]
*  between snaps in order not to, you know, stimulate those with, with some auditory processing issues? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1153.8799999999999s)]
*  Is that what happened to more violence? And today Trump returns to the battleground state of Michigan [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1161.7199999999998s)]
*  holding a town hall here in Flint. CBS news polling shows a virtual dead heat here in Michigan [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1167.8s)]
*  and the real fight in this state is over union workers. The United auto workers union has [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1173.96s)]
*  endorsed Harris, but another key union endorsement from the teamsters is up for grabs. Teamsters, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1179.48s)]
*  president Sean O'Brien, who spoke at the Republican national convention earlier this summer, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1185.6399999999999s)]
*  met with Harris yesterday as part of that decision making process. And O'Brien said a decision on who [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1189.8799999999999s)]
*  or if the union endorses a candidate, he's an undecided voter. It could come as soon as tomorrow. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1195.48s)]
*  And as for the Harris campaign, the vice president is going to be traveling to Pennsylvania today. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1203.24s)]
*  And on Thursday, she will be right here in Michigan hosting a live stream with Oprah Winfrey, Tony, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1207.64s)]
*  Caitlin, thank you very much. I was one of the first people here yesterday. Some people lining [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1214.1200000000001s)]
*  up overnight to get a chance at sitting front row with the Dort financial center in Flint tonight. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1219.0s)]
*  When former president Donald Trump holds a town hall. Now, it hasn't started. It hasn't like began [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1224.6s)]
*  yet with Sarah Sanders. None of the attempt on former president Trump and one of his golf courses [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1231.0s)]
*  in Florida. Trump spoke about it overnight after the suspect appeared in court for the first time. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1237.0s)]
*  Rachel Scott is in West Palm beach with the latest on the investigation. Good morning, Rachel. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1241.3999999999999s)]
*  George, we are learning new details this morning. Officials say this is where the [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1245.0s)]
*  suspect was camped out for nearly 12 hours in those bushes. Just over those hedges is the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1248.76s)]
*  golf course, a secret service agent, just one hole ahead, spotting the barrel of a rifle sticking out. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1254.2s)]
*  Keep walking overnight. New body camera video showing the moment officers arrested the 58 year [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1260.76s)]
*  old man they say camped out on Donald Trump's golf course for 12 hours, allegedly trying to him. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1266.68s)]
*  What's your name? Ryan. Trump was moving across the fair. My NATO king who also wanted to [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1272.92s)]
*  invite Kim Jong Un to his house. Wait near the fifth hole, a secret service agent yelling out gun, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1279.08s)]
*  spotting a barrel of a rifle sticking out from the fence. All of a sudden we heard shots being fired [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1287.3999999999999s)]
*  in the air and I guess probably four or five and it sounded like bullets. But what do I know about [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1293.72s)]
*  that? But secret service knew immediately it was bullets and they grabbed me. The former president [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1299.0s)]
*  recounting it all during an online conversation on the platform X, formerly known as Twitter. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1304.92s)]
*  I was with an agent and the agent did a fantastic job. Secret service immediately surrounding Trump [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1310.04s)]
*  and taking him to a safe location. Sources say agents fired four to six rounds. The subject who [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1315.96s)]
*  did not have line of sight to the former president fled the scene. He did not fire or get off any [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1321.72s)]
*  shots at our agent. With reports of gunfire, the former president's close protection detail [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1328.1200000000001s)]
*  immediately evacuated the president to a safe location. That suspect, Ryan Routh, taking off on [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1333.64s)]
*  foot, jumping into a black Nissan SUV. A witness spotting him driving off, taking a picture of the [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1339.5600000000002s)]
*  license plate number and alerting police. He was smart. He was just driving with the flow of traffic. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1345.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think that he may have thought he got away with it. 45 minutes later, police track down the [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1351.24s)]
*  site. Why not focus more on people sitting at homes that are undecided voters, which is arguably [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1357.96s)]
*  a much larger group. Two reasons. One, because everyone's lazy and two, because it is hard to get [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1362.44s)]
*  non-voters to go out and vote. Suspect traveling northbound on I-95. Tiger, take two steps to your [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1369.72s)]
*  right. You can see him exiting the vehicle, taken into custody. Also, non-voters are never, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1377.8s)]
*  and I mean never going to go and vote for either of these parties in the way that they currently [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1386.8400000000001s)]
*  are. And they're not going to go out and vote no matter how hard one party goes ham on like [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1393.88s)]
*  immigration rhetoric. Like they are not harm reduction voters, right? They don't give a f**k. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1400.28s)]
*  They might give a f**k if there was like a real policy out there that could genuinely improve [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1405.72s)]
*  their lives, right? But overall, it's not going to happen currently. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1413.64s)]
*  Do you think there's anything Trump could do to get you to vote for him? Like if he did a complete [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1423.48s)]
*  180 and became as far left as you possibly can be, what would you do? It would never happen. He [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyZIrrMGMMM&t=1426.76s)]
