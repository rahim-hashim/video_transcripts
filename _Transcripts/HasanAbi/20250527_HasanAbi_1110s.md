# What Really Drove The DC Attacker? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE)
*  When I published Rodriguez manifesto earning me an FBI visit, I stressed how important it was to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=0.0s)]
*  make these materials public. So there wouldn't be an information vacuum for conspiracy theories to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  fill. There is something that, Oh here, this is what I wanted to tell you. It's driving me crazy [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=7.36s)]
*  that people are calling it a false flag. A woman who knew Rodriguez said this development is [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=13.44s)]
*  shocking, but not completely out of character. She remarked echoing sentiment expressed by others. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  All right. Ken Klippenstein went and found Elias Rodriguez is leaked chats accused to Israeli [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=22.64s)]
*  embassy aides, ranted against many things, but not Jews. He is just aching for the FBI to arrest [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=36.56s)]
*  them at this point. I think I am not going to read all of this obviously, but you guys can go read it [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  if you want. I don't think there's anything in here that's like ban worthy, but at this point, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=51.44s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. Is it ban worthy? Is it ban worthy? Perhaps who knows anymore? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=57.68s)]
*  But basically I, I read through it on the side while the stream was going on and most people, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=66.0s)]
*  including one of the people that was like close to Rodriguez basically said, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=74.4s)]
*  that like, where was it? Hold on. He was on, he was on something awful. He was on a you and die [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=81.6s)]
*  the misentropics sub form of something awful. And here's what Graham low stated is more information [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=90.08s)]
*  comes out on Elias Rodriguez, a clearer picture of a hyper online person, mainlining headlines [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=96.56s)]
*  and disaffected by the American political system emerges. No suggestion of anti-Semitism or racially [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=100.32s)]
*  motivated hate despite claims from the Trump admin. But basically it's just, it is my initial [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  assessment was correct, which is that this person is very angry and resentful towards Israel and the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=111.04s)]
*  that Israel is doing and America's participation in that. And the chat logs real man who hated [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  the Republican and democratic parties, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, the right end, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=129.12s)]
*  the left, the bourgeoisie, the United States, the West, and of course Israel even hated the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=134.24s)]
*  only political group I could find. He associated with says, can PSL sucks. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=138.0s)]
*  Shit Rodriguez wrote in one of many messages, lambasting the obscure party for socialism and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=142.8s)]
*  liberation that he had once participated in. I wish I had just done a misadventure with the FRSO [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=148.4s)]
*  freedom road socialist organization rather than PSL law. He wrote, so when it came to raise [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=154.88s)]
*  Rodriguez's hatred seemed reserved for white people where he said, law, you probably would [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=160.64s)]
*  have to actually white people to make this a normal country. Rodriguez wrote in one post, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=167.36s)]
*  like even a very targeted and selective rehabilitation program would probably have to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=171.68s)]
*  lead to a lifetime of imprisonments of tens of millions of white people. I don't think he's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=176.4s)]
*  being super sincere with this statement, but it is, it is a, you know, a classic, those seemingly [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  well-educated college graduate Rodriguez threw around terms like dictatorship of the bourgeoisie [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  disgraced aristocrats and ran it about his own disadvantages in life. His hatred of Israel was [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=193.52s)]
*  evident in policy made the day of October 7th, the day of the Hamas stack on October 7, just saw an [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=198.24s)]
*  incredibly gory video. The aftermath of Israeli troops trying to get dressed with the ambush, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  absolutely secured by Hamas fighters. Lamau love checking back in with the news every few hours, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  like, Hmm, I wonder if Israel still exists. As if he loved it. Rodriguez replied, you don't often [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  get the credibly wonder of Israel is over yet today or not. The picture that emerges from this [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  chat is a one, one of a quick witted voracious reader, even ladies man who was generally well [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=220.72s)]
*  liked by his friends. But underneath all of this was a bitter streak that could veer into casual [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=224.96s)]
*  cruelty. For example, Rodriguez attacked another member of the chat who he saw as privileged for [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=229.2s)]
*  lamenting about the challenges of having a brother with schizophrenia. Rodriguez said in his pose, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=234.32s)]
*  why not just have him committed? You can't possibly be gaining anything from a relationship with a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=238.88s)]
*  person like that. Just put him in a padded room and forget about him. If there was a person you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=242.48s)]
*  loved, he's gone. Now let it go. Can't you just chain him in the basement and slide meals under [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=246.48s)]
*  the door? I'm just tired about hearing about this guy. He's useless. We get it. Stop complaining and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=250.72s)]
*  just dispose of him. So a little bit of a, a little bit of a freak in that regard. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  When I published Rodriguez manifesto earning me an FBI visit, I stressed how important it was to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=263.52s)]
*  make these materials public. So there wouldn't be an information vacuum for conspiracy theories to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=267.28s)]
*  fill. There is something that, oh, here, this is what I wanted to tell you. It's driving me crazy [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=270.88s)]
*  that people are calling it a false flag. A woman who knew Rodriguez said this development is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=276.96s)]
*  shocking, but not completely out of character. She remarked, echoing sentiment expressed by others. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=281.76s)]
*  There were at first, they were at first shocked, but not ultimately surprised that Rodriguez did [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=286.64s)]
*  what he did. That to me is a perfect assessment of the events. And that was also even, even like [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=292.32s)]
*  judging by the limited amount of social media footprint that I had of this guy and, and, and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=300.24s)]
*  everything else that I saw a perfect assessment. And like I said, brain broken by the magnitude [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  of cruelty that he had seen on the timeline, seen in news media and the, and the disinterest. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=313.76s)]
*  The woman said he had always had strong political convictions from the sound of the manifesto. He's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  the same as he was now, bro. I heard on Reddit that you think is a false flag. It's one of the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=327.36s)]
*  most, it's one of my least favorite things that people do online. If you actually, if you actually [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=332.0s)]
*  understand the point I'm making, and then you disagree with it, that's fine. Right? When I say [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=341.2s)]
*  like Israel, Israel's a Nazi state, Israel's doing it. Israel's on a state. And you put that in your [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=345.68s)]
*  article and you say, Hassan says this, this is anti-Semitic. I'll laugh at you saying that that's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=351.36s)]
*  anti-Semitic. And I'll laugh at this disagreement with nothing I've said that's objectionable. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=356.4s)]
*  Right. But whenever people actually will, will take my point and flip it in an effort to criticize [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=362.96s)]
*  what I'm saying, I hate that. I hate that more than anything else. Okay. I hate that more than [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=370.0s)]
*  anything else. Like whenever people go, Oh, he said it was a false flag when it's literally me [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  saying the opposite. I hate that. It makes me so mad. You lie all the time though. Why did you [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=381.04s)]
*  ban that guy? I want to know what that chatter, I want to know what that chatter was saying. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  Where have I lied? Maybe he meant I lie about gaming here. I'm going to unban the guy anyway. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=392.0s)]
*  But basically analysis of his profile reveals understandably frustrated with Israel, but has [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=398.32000000000005s)]
*  also like gotten so frustrated to a degree where he is going to take violent action. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=406.16s)]
*  But at no point does it seem like he is, you can say hatred of Israel is anti-Semitic and that's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  incorrect, right? There are ways in which there are ways in which people who are anti-Semitic will [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  shelter their anti-Semitism under the guys of like valid criticisms of Israel. That's something that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  people do as well. This person is not one of those people. You lied about your shorts. What do you [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=436.88s)]
*  mean? My shorts, my shack shorts. Oh, oh, when I was a kid. Okay, dude, calm down. You could also [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=440.8s)]
*  just say any political violence is unacceptable. You don't have to turn it into anti-Semitism for [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=447.6s)]
*  it not to be unacceptable. Yeah. But the problem is considering the metric ton of violence that's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=451.44s)]
*  coming from Israel, that's a much more difficult argument to have in mainstream media because [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=456.8s)]
*  people are still people, you know what I mean? Like those Palestinians are people, right? The [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=463.6s)]
*  fucking embassy staffers that were in Syria that was blown up by Israel, those are people, you know, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=469.36s)]
*  they've fucking worked in the embassy, right? And when Israel has done so much violence, all of a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  sudden, when you try to, when you're, when you're, you know, trying to tailor this around like [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=481.6s)]
*  violence against like someone who works for the Israeli government, that's a much more difficult [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=489.68s)]
*  argument to make in mainstream media, which is why it has to be around Judaism. I'm still not sure if [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=494.0s)]
*  this was an anti-Semitic attack or not. Why did he target people? He likely didn't know we're tied [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=501.6s)]
*  to Israel in a meaningful way, but it seems premature. 100% to declare it was, I mean, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=504.88s)]
*  I'm sure more information will be revealed in the investigation and the court case, but [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=509.28s)]
*  there are conflicting reports that have come out from the Israeli embassy. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=515.92s)]
*  The Israeli embassy said that these guys knew who the people were that he killed. That's, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  that's also another part of the story. Like not knew who they were, but like knew that they were [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=525.76s)]
*  working for the Israeli embassy, but also the event that he went to, it was rando. He did not. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=529.76s)]
*  I don't know if the Israeli embassy lied about that, but I'm just saying that that's what they [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=536.8s)]
*  said. Having said that, having said that the event that he got, the event that he tried to get into, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=541.04s)]
*  and apparently there is some confusion here as well, but the event that he was targeting was a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=549.28s)]
*  American Jewish community committee, AJC event that was specifically for diplomats, young diplomats, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=554.8s)]
*  Israeli diplomats, included. Now the question also is like, why would he go to DC? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=565.3599999999999s)]
*  He lives in Chicago. If he wants to do an anti-Semitic attack, you think there aren't, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=573.5999999999999s)]
*  you know, Jewish people in Chicago. Like, what are you crazy? There's a ton of Jewish people in [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=579.3599999999999s)]
*  Chicago. There's definitely Jewish people in Chicago. Yeah. You fucking hide park. Like, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=583.92s)]
*  what are you talking about? Can you question? How can you be critical of Israel without looking [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=587.5999999999999s)]
*  anti-Semitic? What? It's very easy. I do it every single day. People still say I'm anti-Semitic, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=592.48s)]
*  but it doesn't matter. Yeah. Large Jewish population, like four miles from where he lived [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=598.96s)]
*  in town, literally shuts down on the weekends. Yeah. So does that prove it was premeditated? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=602.48s)]
*  Yes. I mean, it definitely was premeditated. It definitely was premeditated. The difference is, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=607.28s)]
*  is it a premeditated hate crime against Jewish people as the media was quick to suggest, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=612.64s)]
*  or was it a targeted attack of political violence against people that work in the Israeli embassy? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=617.84s)]
*  I'm leaning on the side of, I'm leaning on the side of, of a premeditated targeted attack against [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=625.04s)]
*  people who worked in the Israeli embassy and, and not a, not a like random anti-Semitic attack. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=631.12s)]
*  The Israeli ambassador claimed he went in and stalked them. The AJC and the event runner said [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=640.48s)]
*  he never went in and identified anyone. Also, it wasn't primarily Israeli diplomats. It was just [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=644.16s)]
*  DC Jewish professionals talk about diplomacy. It's just very unclear right now. No, it wasn't [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=648.88s)]
*  just DC Jewish professionals to talk about diplomacy. The, the event itself was, was like [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=653.52s)]
*  a young diplomats conference. And so I don't know if it's a, when it was not a single person was a [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=660.56s)]
*  Israeli diplomat or working for the Israeli embassy. I do find it very strange. I do, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=669.68s)]
*  I do find it very strange that people are quick to say that these guys were actually trying to [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  find peaceable solutions to Palestine, to the Palestinian problem that I definitely take issue [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  with. The AJC is not invested in a peaceful solution to the Palestinian question. Okay. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=688.56s)]
*  None of these advocacy groups, 19 months in, I'm sorry, you know exactly which advocacy groups are [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=696.72s)]
*  actually invested in a peaceful solution to the Palestinians. They are called anti-Semitic by the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=703.04s)]
*  ADL go, you know, look up the Jewish advocacy groups that are on the ADL website to find out [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=709.04s)]
*  more about the only, the only advocacy groups that are interested in a peaceful solution. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=716.72s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. Here the American Jewish committee, if you key search genocide, it returns 310 results. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=723.04s)]
*  American Jewish committee decries amnesty international's report on false genocide charge. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=730.7199999999999s)]
*  AJC's Jacob Blousy and Institute UN diplomatic leaders reaffirm commitment to genocide convention. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=735.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay. The only AJC statement on international court of justice arguments in baseless genocide [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=740.8s)]
*  case against Israel. Israel's not committing a genocide. So no, I don't, I don't think that [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=746.24s)]
*  they're, you know, it was DC Jewish professionals. Most of the people there were not actual [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  diplomats. It was about bringing local Jewish youth together with diplomats. According to the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=759.4399999999999s)]
*  event description, this annual reception brings to our Jewish young professionals, ages 22 to 45 [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=762.56s)]
*  and diplomats from around the world. And you're right. AJC is not exactly a peace or yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  No, I'm, I, I, I understand what you're saying. There isn't, that's why I said there is no, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=771.2s)]
*  there is no, a guarantee. There is no guarantee that he was going to find Israeli embassy staffers [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=777.44s)]
*  there. He ended up finding them, but it's not like there was a guarantee there. But again, it, it [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=785.36s)]
*  leads, it leads one to ask why would he go to DC to an AJC event? Are there, if he wanted to just [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=793.68s)]
*  kill random Jewish people, he lives in Chicago. Maybe the guy was misguided in the target, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=801.28s)]
*  just hate for a race. Those members of this race happen to be from Israel. No, I don't think so. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=807.76s)]
*  I'm telling you, I have no one, I don't have 100% certainty of visions beyond all of the things that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=812.2399999999999s)]
*  we've found out about him, but I think he wanted to target someone connected to Israel. That's [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=820.88s)]
*  where I'm landing on as opposed to instantly going, this was a pro Palestinian demonstrators [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=826.16s)]
*  that he shot and killed with no evidence suggesting that that was the case. Like he fucking flew [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=834.4s)]
*  in this, he flew to DC. Like this was premeditated. Yes, you can fly with a gun chatter. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=841.76s)]
*  You just have, if you're a, a, if you have a, a permit, you can check in your gun with your luggage [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=850.1600000000001s)]
*  in the United States of America, or maybe you don't even need to have a permit. Actually, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=860.32s)]
*  I don't know. Just not on the plane unless important. Yeah. You can. Yeah. You can. So [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=864.48s)]
*  are you no longer saying this was an antisemitic attack? I recall you saying the other day that it [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=871.36s)]
*  was clearly antisemitic. No, I don't think it would. No, I didn't say that. No, I said that [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=874.96s)]
*  I didn't say that at all. I was actually what I was literally saying the opposite. I'm saying that [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=880.24s)]
*  I'm leaning on the side. My bad must be remiss remembering. No, I said I was leaning on the side [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=888.1600000000001s)]
*  that this was a person who wanted to, you know, kill someone who works with Israel, works within [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=892.32s)]
*  Israel, Israeli diplomat or the like. I think he wanted to literally do the, the, the stories [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=898.24s)]
*  that I've mentioned already, like David Frankfurter or what's the other guy's name? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=908.64s)]
*  The one that the Nazis blame crystal knocked on the, the one who killed the French, the Nazi [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=914.48s)]
*  embassy, like went into the Nazi embassy in France and shot [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=920.4s)]
*  the, the, the German diplomat Herschel Grinspan. Yes. Thank you. That's what I think he was doing. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=924.24s)]
*  But yeah, what I will say is I am, I'm not going to lie. I didn't think that the media would [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=934.24s)]
*  so quickly whip back to the genocide of the Palestinians. Like I thought that they would, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=944.72s)]
*  I thought that they would talk about this story for at least, at least like, I don't know, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=952.48s)]
*  maybe like three, four more days. And it's, it's crazy. Even like there were people who literally [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=958.96s)]
*  were like, this attack is awesome and more should happen and stuff. Right. There were people on [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=964.16s)]
*  TikTok saying stuff like that. And even their condemnations didn't make it into the media [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  cycle that much. Like, like New York post covered that one Tik TOK or I think who said something [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=974.88s)]
*  like, this is awesome. I don't know. I don't know what he fucking said. I don't really give a shit, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=980.8s)]
*  but, but that's it. There wasn't like widespread condemnation from the New York times or anything [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=984.64s)]
*  like that. I think it's cause it's clearly nice to make no, no, no, no. I think you're [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=992.0s)]
*  misunderstanding. I think people heard that it was antisemitic and still didn't care. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=997.1999999999999s)]
*  I think people at this point are just like, dude, stop, stop Israel, please. Like I think that is [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1002.64s)]
*  what the, the actual like broader position of the American public is. Like, I don't even think that [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1009.68s)]
*  they were making this assessment. I don't think that they were making this assessment that like, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1018.16s)]
*  is this antisemitic? Is this an antisemitic violence? I think America's, I think America, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1022.56s)]
*  like the, the, the broader collective consciousness and their tolerance for even political violence or [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1027.84s)]
*  even hate crimes is quite literally reaching a level where it doesn't even make the fucking news [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1036.16s)]
*  for Americans. It doesn't even like, we're so used to violence all the time. We are so used to violence [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1044.0s)]
*  all the time, both the structural violence that we experienced that we don't even fucking verbalize [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1050.96s)]
*  as violence or even assume as violence, but we feel the impact of it. But then also the, the daily [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1057.6000000000001s)]
*  mass shootings that take place and, and everything else that I think Americans basically are just, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1064.08s)]
*  Hassan, are you okay? Political violence? What? No, I'm saying Americans just don't care. They are so [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1070.6399999999999s)]
*  desensitized. Like it's, it's shocking. Our capacity to care. Can I have your dog? She looked like she [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1077.68s)]
*  needed a better home with a dad that give her more money. What a dad that give her more money. This [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1086.08s)]
*  dog lives a better life than you chatter. What the fuck are you talking about? Can I do a money [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1092.0s)]
*  spread? She'd better do a money spread. Anyway, on that note, I'm tired. I don't know why I can't [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1096.56s)]
*  make it to eight hours nowadays. I'm getting old, man. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05I_A9m_FOE&t=1101.36s)]
