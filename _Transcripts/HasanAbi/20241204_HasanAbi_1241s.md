# Hasan Piker Delivers Powerful Speech At Cambridge University
**HasanAbi:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c)
*  I urge you not to lean into nihilism and succumb to helplessness, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=0.0s)]
*  because you do not need the academic pedigree to know right from wrong. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=5.12s)]
*  All you need is your moral compass. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=10.48s)]
*  As someone who has seen the Palestine Question [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=13.76s)]
*  evolve over my past 10 years of public advocacy, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=17.68s)]
*  I never would have imagined international organs demand legal [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=21.92s)]
*  restitution from America's most valuable asset. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=24.96s)]
*  After all, there are decades where nothing happens, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=29.2s)]
*  and there are weeks where decades happen. Thank you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=32.88s)]
*  Applause [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=36.56s)]
*  I'm sure all the chat will remind me if I'm looking. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=44.56s)]
*  Alright, you'll start with me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=48.56s)]
*  So he's going to be up there. I'm going to give you guys a better angle. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=52.56s)]
*  One sec, please hold. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=54.56s)]
*  Something like this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=56.56s)]
*  I'm sure you didn't want 17,000 people to hear. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=58.56s)]
*  I agree. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=62.56s)]
*  I'll adjust depending on what chair he's sitting in, okay? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=64.56s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=66.56s)]
*  I'm going to give you a little bit of a time to think. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=68.56s)]
*  I'm going to give you a little bit of time to think. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=70.56s)]
*  I'm going to give you a little bit of time to think. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=72.56s)]
*  I'm going to give you a little bit of time to think. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=74.56s)]
*  Okay, don't worry. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=76.56s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=78.56s)]
*  I hope everyone's polite. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=80.56s)]
*  Holy shit, it's a good thing I brought the wide angle lens. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=82.56s)]
*  Or the zoom lens. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=84.56s)]
*  This is the whole area. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=86.56s)]
*  Also, the other guy is still mic'd up. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=88.56s)]
*  I really hope he is not peeing or saying something. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=90.56s)]
*  We'll start in a second. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=92.56s)]
*  Okay, crazy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=94.56s)]
*  What's up? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=96.56s)]
*  Just stay out here and give us the mic. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=98.56s)]
*  I'm just going to grab the microphone real quick. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=100.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=102.56s)]
*  I'll just throw it in. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=104.56s)]
*  Are you all good? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=108.56s)]
*  Is he okay to get the microphone back? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=110.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=112.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=116.56s)]
*  I'm good, thank you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=118.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=124.56s)]
*  Sorry, I'm sorry. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=126.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=128.56s)]
*  Enjoy your meal. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=130.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=132.56s)]
*  Alright, thank you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=134.56s)]
*  We need to fill it up. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=136.56s)]
*  We don't need to fill it up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=138.56s)]
*  Where are you guys going? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=140.56s)]
*  I was just saying about the front row. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=142.56s)]
*  Yeah, we're about to start. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=144.56s)]
*  You should go on the front row. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=146.56s)]
*  Okay, all good? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=148.56s)]
*  Ready to go? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=150.56s)]
*  I'll just go into the juicing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=152.56s)]
*  Okay, and then I walk in after you introduce me? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=154.56s)]
*  Yeah, and I'll sit down. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=156.56s)]
*  Then you can come and do your speech. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=158.56s)]
*  Okay, perfect. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=160.56s)]
*  Good evening, everyone. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=186.56s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=188.56s)]
*  We have a very special guest today. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=190.56s)]
*  He's a live streamer. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=192.56s)]
*  He's a political commentator. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=194.56s)]
*  And he's a powerful public figure. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=196.56s)]
*  Please give a very warm welcome to Mr. Hassan Piker. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=198.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=212.56s)]
*  What's up, everybody? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=214.56s)]
*  I hope everyone's having a great time. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=216.56s)]
*  Before I get started, I asked [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=218.56s)]
*  if they'd ever actually hosted a Twitch streamer here before. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=220.56s)]
*  And apparently I'm the first. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=222.56s)]
*  And judging by my performance, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=224.56s)]
*  I'll probably be the last. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=226.56s)]
*  I don't really know why I'm here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=228.56s)]
*  Or what I can contribute to the conversation [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=230.56s)]
*  in terms of the ongoing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=232.56s)]
*  in Gaza that has unfolded [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=234.56s)]
*  over the past year and a half, almost. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=236.56s)]
*  And I'm going to start with a question [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=238.56s)]
*  that I've been asked a lot. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=240.56s)]
*  And I'm going to start with a question [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=242.56s)]
*  over the past year and a half, almost, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=244.56s)]
*  that many other [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=246.56s)]
*  more credible speakers [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=248.56s)]
*  could speak to convincingly [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=250.56s)]
*  from a point of personal involvement [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=252.56s)]
*  and a position of authority. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=254.56s)]
*  Having said that, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=256.56s)]
*  however, I'm going to try to do [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=258.56s)]
*  my best here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=260.56s)]
*  This August body has [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=262.56s)]
*  seen some of the best minds inside [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=264.56s)]
*  of its halls, and now it's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=266.56s)]
*  hosting a Twitch streamer. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=268.56s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=270.56s)]
*  following the footsteps [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=272.56s)]
*  of intellectual giants [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=274.56s)]
*  as nothing but a simple man. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=276.56s)]
*  A simple man who understands [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=278.56s)]
*  right from wrong. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=280.56s)]
*  And sometimes that's all that matters. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=282.56s)]
*  In the words of my friend, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=284.56s)]
*  the late great Michael Jamal Brooks, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=286.56s)]
*  there's nothing [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=288.56s)]
*  complicated about apartheid. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=290.56s)]
*  The reality of it is clear. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=292.56s)]
*  If the roles were reversed in a captive [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=294.56s)]
*  Jewish population of five [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=296.56s)]
*  million people were being [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=298.56s)]
*  systematically starved, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=300.56s)]
*  sieged, and dominated, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=302.56s)]
*  everyone would understand what's going on. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=304.56s)]
*  It's ancestral lands being [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=306.56s)]
*  destroyed, everyone would understand [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=308.56s)]
*  what's going on. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=310.56s)]
*  So in his words, it's not a complex [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=312.56s)]
*  issue. It's super simple. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=314.56s)]
*  It's the most powerful country [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=316.56s)]
*  in the Middle East, it's backed by the United [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=318.56s)]
*  States, the most powerful country on the planet, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=320.56s)]
*  and it acts on [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=322.56s)]
*  another population of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=324.56s)]
*  people with total [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=326.56s)]
*  impunity and has never held [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=328.56s)]
*  accountable for anything. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=330.56s)]
*  Well, I guess some things are changing in that regard [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=332.56s)]
*  and we'll get to that in a little bit. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=334.56s)]
*  But there is no symmetry in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=336.56s)]
*  this relationship, period. That's what [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=338.56s)]
*  Michael Jamal Brooks said. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=340.56s)]
*  So I see no need for obfuscation, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=342.56s)]
*  no arguments for [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=344.56s)]
*  complexity, no reasoning [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=346.56s)]
*  for preemptive j******. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=348.56s)]
*  Israel is an apartheid [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=350.56s)]
*  state and its inception was [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=352.56s)]
*  a violent one with the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=354.56s)]
*  forced displacement of 700,000, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=356.56s)]
*  which gave birth to a [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=358.56s)]
*  settler colonial entity that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=360.56s)]
*  continues to dominate the lives [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=362.56s)]
*  of more than 5 million [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=364.56s)]
*  Palestinians under its illegal [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=366.56s)]
*  occupation, totaling [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=368.56s)]
*  15 million Palestinians around [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=370.56s)]

*  In 1948, Einstein [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=438.56s)]
*  and a number of Jewish academics [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=440.56s)]

*  against a visit to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=444.56s)]

*  Menachem Bein also was never able to actually [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=448.56s)]

*  the dangers that nationalism of this [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=474.56s)]

*  he had fled Nazi Germany. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=478.56s)]
*  Nowadays, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=480.56s)]
*  this sort of analysis is met [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=482.56s)]
*  with tremendous resistance. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=484.56s)]
*  Given our comforts living in the heart [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=486.56s)]
*  of empire, we focus more on the feelings [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=488.56s)]
*  of those in the West [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=490.56s)]
*  rather than the violence [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=492.56s)]
*  that our tax dollars [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=494.56s)]
*  are contributing to. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=496.56s)]
*  But I want to go back to the beginning [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=498.56s)]
*  for a little bit, which helped me understand [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=500.56s)]
*  the ways in which Israel's [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=502.56s)]
*  violence has remained [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=504.56s)]
*  unchecked, especially [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=506.56s)]
*  because the similarities [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=508.56s)]
*  in the contemporary way that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=510.56s)]
*  Israel has dished out its violence [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=512.56s)]
*  are glaringly obvious. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=514.56s)]
*  I want to talk about the atrocities committed in [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=516.56s)]
*  Deir Yassin, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=518.56s)]
*  the former Palestinian village a few [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=520.56s)]
*  miles west of Jerusalem. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=522.56s)]
*  I say former because in April [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=524.56s)]
*  1948, over [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=526.56s)]
*  100 of its Arab residents [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=528.56s)]
*  were executed, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=530.56s)]
*  ruthlessly slaughtered. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=532.56s)]
*  There were graphic stories [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=534.56s)]
*  that were told of some of the survivors, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=536.56s)]
*  including, but not [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=540.56s)]
*  limited to, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=542.56s)]
*  having a baker [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=544.56s)]
*  and his son lined up [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=546.56s)]
*  against the baker's oven [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=548.56s)]
*  and trying to force the baker to throw [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=550.56s)]
*  his son in the oven, and when he [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=552.56s)]
*  refused to cooperate, throwing his son [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=554.56s)]
*  in the oven and then throwing him in afterwards. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=556.56s)]
*  The only reason why [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=558.56s)]
*  we know is because [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=560.56s)]
*  there were survivors that were left [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=562.56s)]
*  to tell the story, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=564.56s)]
*  so they could go and tell the other Arab villages [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=566.56s)]
*  that if the Zionist brigades [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=568.56s)]
*  were coming, that they must evacuate. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=570.56s)]
*  The massacre was committed by [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=576.56s)]
*  Zionist forces. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=578.56s)]
*  Radical right-wingers led the attack [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=580.56s)]
*  but were supported by the Haganah, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=582.56s)]
*  which later became [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=584.56s)]
*  the IDF. But Deir Yassin [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=586.56s)]
*  was not an isolated massacre. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=588.56s)]
*  It was a pivotal moment. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=590.56s)]
*  Deir Yassin helped convince the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=592.56s)]
*  Arab governments to fight Israel. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=594.56s)]
*  People fled their towns and villages [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=596.56s)]
*  fearful that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=598.56s)]
*  what happens at Deir Yassin might [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=600.56s)]
*  happen in their towns. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=602.56s)]
*  700,000 people never allowed [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=604.56s)]
*  to return to their homes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=606.56s)]
*  Palestinians call this the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=608.56s)]
*  Nakba. It's also known as [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=610.56s)]

*  these were not merely nationalists [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=640.56s)]
*  or settlers run amok. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=642.56s)]

*  that they voluntarily left their [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=654.56s)]

*  And in 1948, when people all over [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=700.56s)]
*  the world took notice of Israel's savage [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=702.56s)]
*  treatment of Palestinians, Israel [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=704.56s)]
*  could only respond by [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=706.56s)]
*  lying, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=708.56s)]
*  using Hasbara [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=710.56s)]
*  to tell a different kind of story [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=712.56s)]
*  about its atrocities. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=714.56s)]
*  In 2024, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=716.56s)]
*  we still have the same problem. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=718.56s)]
*  Now people always ask me, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=720.56s)]
*  Hassan, why is Israel [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=722.56s)]
*  so important? And I think this is [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=724.56s)]
*  a rhetorical trick. Why is Israel's [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=726.56s)]
*  allegiance to America so important? I think a lot [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=728.56s)]
*  of people ask this in earnest, but some [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=730.56s)]
*  people ask because they want me to say [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=732.56s)]
*  anti-Semitic things. They think [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=734.56s)]
*  that I'm going to say, oh, because Jews are [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=736.56s)]
*  powerful, they control the media, they control the government. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=738.56s)]
*  This is not true. That's not [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=740.56s)]
*  the reason. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=742.56s)]
*  At this point, at different points throughout time, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=744.56s)]
*  the story in Israel [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=746.56s)]
*  and Palestine has been more or less [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=748.56s)]
*  the same. But ultimately, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=750.56s)]
*  Israel has served different [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=752.56s)]
*  purposes for the United States, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=754.56s)]
*  its primary benefactor. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=756.56s)]
*  Israel has been [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=758.56s)]
*  our Cold War ally. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=760.56s)]
*  Israel has been a punisher [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=762.56s)]
*  of misbehaving [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=764.56s)]
*  Arab oil states. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=766.56s)]
*  Israel has been a partner [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=768.56s)]
*  in Western espionage. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=770.56s)]
*  It is an unsinkable aircraft carrier in a [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=772.56s)]
*  resource-rich region. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=774.56s)]
*  That's very important to American [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=776.56s)]
*  State Department interests. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=778.56s)]
*  But for 66 years, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=780.56s)]
*  the violence has continued. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=784.56s)]
*  With broad support from [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=786.56s)]
*  the West, the Israeli government [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=788.56s)]
*  has been free to occupy Palestinian lands [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=790.56s)]
*  and destroy Palestinian [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=792.56s)]
*  life. Ever since the failure [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=794.56s)]
*  of the Oslo peace process in 2000, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=796.56s)]
*  the rise of the Settler movement, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=798.56s)]
*  and Benjamin Netanyahu taking [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=800.56s)]
*  control of the Israeli government, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=802.56s)]
*  America's ironclad support for [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=804.56s)]
*  Israel has remained exactly [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=806.56s)]
*  that. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=808.56s)]
*  But in the last decade, something has [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=810.56s)]
*  changed. Two things have changed [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=812.56s)]
*  as a matter of fact. The first [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=814.56s)]
*  is that Israel has totally [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=816.56s)]
*  lost the younger generation. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=818.56s)]
*  The younger generation of [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=820.56s)]
*  Americans, but also the younger generation [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=822.56s)]
*  of the Western world in general, who [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=824.56s)]
*  are shocked by its policies [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=826.56s)]
*  in occupied Palestinian lands. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=828.56s)]
*  And the second thing [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=830.56s)]
*  that has happened is that Israel's [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=832.56s)]
*  powerful advocates in US [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=834.56s)]
*  politics and media, the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=836.56s)]
*  Israel lobby, no longer have [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=838.56s)]
*  a total [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=840.56s)]
*  stranglehold on the left [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=842.56s)]
*  and the right. The media is [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=844.56s)]
*  not as favorable to Israel as it once [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=846.56s)]
*  was. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=848.56s)]
*  I'm obviously a living, breathing [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=850.56s)]
*  example of this. I think someone like myself [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=852.56s)]
*  would not exist in any other format, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=854.56s)]
*  in any other medium, in any other time. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=856.56s)]
*  But [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=858.56s)]
*  that's not the entire story, obviously. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=860.56s)]
*  I'm not just here to focus on myself [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=862.56s)]
*  and what I do. I think I want to talk [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=864.56s)]
*  a little bit more about the broader picture, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=866.56s)]
*  the bigger picture. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=868.56s)]
*  You never could really hide [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=870.56s)]
*  a genocide from the world. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=872.56s)]
*  But it's especially difficult in [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=874.56s)]
*  the present moment. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=876.56s)]
*  Every day, we are inundated with [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=878.56s)]
*  footage from Gaza [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=880.56s)]
*  of untold atrocities, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=882.56s)]
*  countless atrocities. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=884.56s)]
*  We see depictions [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=886.56s)]
*  of the worst that humanity has to offer. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=888.56s)]
*  We see [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=890.56s)]
*  children in body bags, drone strikes, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=892.56s)]
*  mass displacement, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=894.56s)]
*  the horror. We see missing relatives, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=896.56s)]
*  sick babies, wailing mothers, and so on. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=898.56s)]
*  The [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=900.56s)]
*  accumulation of this evidence, freely [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=902.56s)]
*  available on today's internet, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=904.56s)]
*  is what is [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=906.56s)]
*  currently burying Israel in the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=908.56s)]
*  court of public opinion. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=910.56s)]
*  It's turning Israel into a pariah state. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=912.56s)]
*  Hasbara wasn't built to [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=914.56s)]
*  refute this many dead children. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=916.56s)]
*  Israel was really [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=920.56s)]
*  bailed out in the media in the past [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=922.56s)]
*  because of how slow the establishment [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=924.56s)]
*  press was to recognize the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=926.56s)]
*  atrocities that are unfolding. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=928.56s)]
*  It took prestigious [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=930.56s)]
*  outlets many weeks and months [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=932.56s)]
*  to tentatively identify an obvious genocide [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=934.56s)]
*  that quickly came together in a [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=936.56s)]
*  matter of days. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=938.56s)]
*  Nowadays, you learn about the gruesome [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=940.56s)]
*  conditions of Sedeh Tehman, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=942.56s)]

*  copters sniping children, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=946.56s)]
*  or broadcasting the sound [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=948.56s)]
*  of children crying for help to lure [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=950.56s)]
*  out unsuspecting Palestinians [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=952.56s)]
*  with the express purpose of murder [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=954.56s)]
*  months before it [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=956.56s)]
*  reaches the headlines of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=958.56s)]
*  legacy publishers in the West. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=960.56s)]
*  That is, if they're [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=962.56s)]
*  covered at all, like the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=964.56s)]
*  pro-sh** riots, pro-sh** January [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=966.56s)]
*  6 that took place [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=968.56s)]
*  after the Israeli government [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=970.56s)]
*  tried to prosecute nine concentration [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=972.56s)]
*  camp guards [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=974.56s)]
*  for, I'm sorry, for [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=976.56s)]
*  using this language here, for raping [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=978.56s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners to death [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=980.56s)]
*  on camera. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=982.56s)]
*  I say tried because [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=984.56s)]
*  not only did the riots succeed, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=986.56s)]
*  the main perpetrator became [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=988.56s)]
*  a television personality. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=990.56s)]
*  And so [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=992.56s)]
*  we have learned since October 7 [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=994.56s)]
*  that Israel can conduct such wide-scale [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=996.56s)]
*  atrocities, killings, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=998.56s)]
*  kidnappings, and bombings, and expulsions [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1000.56s)]
*  even without its usual [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1002.56s)]
*  PR shield, so long [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1004.56s)]
*  as its actual political shield [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1006.56s)]
*  in Washington holds up [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1008.56s)]
*  as well as the Iron Dome. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1010.56s)]
*  Now, there is a [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1012.56s)]
*  subtle but horribly corrosive [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1014.56s)]
*  effect that this has had [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1018.56s)]
*  on how people understand the world around [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1020.56s)]
*  them. At the very moment [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1022.56s)]
*  when fact-based reporting and serious journalism [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1024.56s)]
*  is most needed [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1026.56s)]
*  in this time, people are distrustful of the news. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1028.56s)]
*  Platforms like [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1030.56s)]
*  Twitter routinely surface [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1032.56s)]
*  the worst of the worst [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1034.56s)]
*  kinds of content, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1036.56s)]
*  but the most divisive, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1038.56s)]
*  most hateful content, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1040.56s)]
*  but Elon Musk is not the only [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1042.56s)]
*  person responsible for this. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1044.56s)]
*  And I hate Elon Musk, okay? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1046.56s)]
*  I hate Elon Musk as much as you guys hate Oxford [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1048.56s)]
*  College. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1050.56s)]
*  I heard that if I say that, I'll get some [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1052.56s)]
*  applause breaks there, so [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1054.56s)]
*  that was my exit ramp. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1056.56s)]
*  But it's not just Elon Musk, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1058.56s)]
*  it's not just Twitter. It's happening all around. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1060.56s)]
*  Young people, men in [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1062.56s)]
*  particular, who don't have much education [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1064.56s)]
*  or literacy skills with no hopeful [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1066.56s)]
*  prospects of the future, are being propagandized [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1068.56s)]
*  by waves of right-wing [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1070.56s)]
*  influencers who have never had [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1072.56s)]
*  megaphones this loud. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1074.56s)]
*  Although this issue most often gets brought up [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1076.56s)]
*  in the context of the 2024 election [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1078.56s)]
*  in Donald Trump, there's [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1080.56s)]
*  more to this. I think it's important to connect it to [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1082.56s)]
*  the current levels of violence [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1084.56s)]
*  that are happening in the country. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1086.56s)]
*  And I think it's important to connect it to [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1088.56s)]
*  the current levels of violence that are happening in [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1090.56s)]
*  Palestine as well. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1092.56s)]
*  These are forces who want to [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1094.56s)]
*  normalize the current levels [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1096.56s)]
*  of violence. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1098.56s)]
*  And to convince people that actually [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1100.56s)]
*  it's good to be this bloodthirsty. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1102.56s)]
*  While it was Joe Biden who gave [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1104.56s)]
*  Israel the blank check with [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1106.56s)]
*  which to commit a genocide, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1108.56s)]
*  that decision has created an entire [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1110.56s)]
*  whole new world of violence. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1112.56s)]
*  And I think that's what we've seen in the [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1114.56s)]
*  Donald Trump cabinet picks, you know exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1116.56s)]
*  The traditional forces that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1118.56s)]
*  could keep this kind of thing in check, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1120.56s)]
*  particularly in politics and in media, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1122.56s)]
*  are unfortunately weak. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1124.56s)]
*  And they're getting weaker by the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1126.56s)]
*  moment. They're out of power. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1128.56s)]
*  They're broke. They're technologically weak. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1130.56s)]
*  They don't understand the space. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1132.56s)]
*  They don't understand the online [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1134.56s)]
*  content creation sphere. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1136.56s)]
*  And [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1138.56s)]
*  I feel like [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1140.56s)]
*  they've most importantly [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1142.56s)]
*  with their coverage [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1144.56s)]
*  of Gaza discredited [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1146.56s)]
*  themselves to an entire generation. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1148.56s)]
*  It seems [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1150.56s)]
*  right now that those people [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1152.56s)]
*  who genuinely desire [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1154.56s)]
*  for a better future, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1156.56s)]
*  who want an alternative to the genocide, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1158.56s)]
*  will have to start looking [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1160.56s)]
*  amongst themselves, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1162.56s)]
*  looking within themselves, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1164.56s)]
*  their friends, and away from the mainstream [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1166.56s)]
*  if they want to help bring something [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1168.56s)]
*  like justice into the world. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1170.56s)]
*  So I stand before you [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1172.56s)]
*  as a man who simply wants [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1174.56s)]
*  some semblance of justice [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1176.56s)]
*  for the Palestinians. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1178.56s)]
*  I urge you not to lean into nihilism [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1180.56s)]
*  and succumb to helplessness [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1182.56s)]
*  because you [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1184.56s)]
*  do not need the academic [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1186.56s)]
*  pedigree to know right from wrong. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1188.56s)]
*  All you need is your [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1190.56s)]
*  moral compass. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1192.56s)]
*  As someone who has seen the Palestine [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1194.56s)]
*  revolution evolve [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1196.56s)]
*  over my past [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1198.56s)]
*  10 years of public advocacy, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1200.56s)]
*  I never would have imagined [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1202.56s)]
*  international organs demand legal restitution [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1204.56s)]
*  from America's most [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1206.56s)]
*  valuable asset. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1208.56s)]
*  After all, there are decades [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1210.56s)]
*  where nothing happens, and there are [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1212.56s)]
*  weeks where decades happen. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZe8PfEUe1c&t=1214.56s)]
