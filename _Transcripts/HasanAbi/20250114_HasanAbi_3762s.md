**HasanAbi:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0)
*  Unsari added this war should have been over a long time ago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=0.0s)]
*  Palestinian negotiators told drop site. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=4.84s)]
*  They remain cautiously optimistic. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  A deal will be signed though. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=8.72s)]
*  They point to previous rounds of ceasefire negotiations that saw Israeli prime minister [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=10.24s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu insert new demands at the 11th hour, something that we covered extensively. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=18.52s)]
*  There are actually our foreign policy wasn't bad tour right now, which is of course laughable [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=19.52s)]
*  because as you guys know, there is a side deal that has taken place where Donald Trump is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=29.78s)]
*  going to get all the glory of potentially facilitating a fire deal. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=36.300000000000004s)]
*  And it's not because he actually applied any sort of pressure to Hamas. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  Lo and behold, shockingly enough, it was actually because they had to apply pressure to Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=44.18s)]
*  So obviously we're going to be covering that a little bit more extensively, but before [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=50.660000000000004s)]
*  we get to that, obviously that reality kind of puts a stain on the Joe Biden and Anthony [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=54.739999999999995s)]
*  Blinken media tour. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=63.3s)]
*  But let's take a look at what happened. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=65.78s)]
*  We strengthen America's robust regime on Iran and delivered on president Biden's commitment. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=67.7s)]

*  We've held car rallies. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  The blood of innocent civilians of children is on your hands. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=94.74000000000001s)]

*  These are the goals that I've worked to advance over a dozen trips to the region since October [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=99.78s)]
*  7th. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=118.78s)]
*  It's so good because it's like they know they're going to get kicked out. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=119.78s)]
*  So they're just like waiting one at a time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  Anytime he starts talking about it, he's like, shame on you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=125.34s)]
*  How do you break American law? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=128.34s)]
*  How do you do all that and sit here and tell these people, civilized people, that you are [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=129.34s)]
*  doing what? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=138.34s)]
*  Kill, kill your policy for the Middle East? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=139.34s)]
*  Kill, kill, and kill, and kill. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=140.34s)]
*  Because the dean's really saying you're a brutal war criminal. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=141.34s)]
*  We sat in front of your house for a year. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=142.34s)]
*  You have no compassion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=143.34s)]
*  You are a monster. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=144.34s)]
*  Is that hard to achieve? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=145.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=146.34s)]
*  Peace in the region always has been. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=147.34s)]
*  For over 450 days, Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinian people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=149.34s)]
*  We have sent over $25 billion to Israel in the past year. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=152.34s)]
*  That's $70 of all of our money. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=155.34s)]
*  $70 that we are using to send guns, to send bombs, and to kill the side. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=156.34s)]
*  Lincoln, you're a monster. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=157.34s)]

*  You're a monster. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=175.34s)]
*  You're a monster. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=176.34s)]
*  You lied on May 10th to Congress. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=177.34s)]
*  You lied. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=178.34s)]
*  Proposal to look it up. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=179.34s)]
*  May 10th. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=180.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=181.34s)]
*  And then the heels of Anthony Blinken doing a failed media tour talking about how sick [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=182.34s)]
*  he is as a statesman. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=194.34s)]
*  We are at a new stage in the Gaza S**t Fire deal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=197.34s)]
*  And I will say this much. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=201.34s)]
*  than ever before. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=204.22s)]
*  And it's not because of Trump glaze or anything like that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=205.82s)]
*  But I mean, this is being reported on by the who's reporting. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=208.46s)]
*  I definitely trust. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=212.18s)]
*  Jeremy says the prospect for an agreement to halt Israel's war against the Palestinians [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=214.38s)]
*  in Gaza is at its most promising point in over a year. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=217.5s)]
*  Source close to Hamas negotiating team tell drop site news that on Monday Hamas agreed [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=220.9s)]
*  to the framework text, including an exchange of captives and hostages and had not requested [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=225.14s)]
*  any significant changes or amendments. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=231.1s)]
*  But the devil as always is in the details. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=232.94s)]
*  Many of the obstacles have been ironed out, said Majid Al Ansari, the spokesperson for [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=236.18s)]
*  Qatar's foreign ministry and a press conference in Doha, where the negotiations are taking [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=239.38s)]
*  place. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=243.74s)]
*  There are many pending issues, part of which is related to the implementation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=244.84s)]
*  We believe we have minimized many of the disagreements between both parties and current discussions [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=248.18s)]
*  are focused on the final details. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=251.66s)]
*  And where is it? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=256.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=258.7s)]
*  We are closest than at any other time in the past to a deal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=259.9s)]
*  Ansari added this war should have been over a long time ago. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=264.73999999999995s)]
*  Palestinian negotiators told drop site. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=269.17999999999995s)]
*  They remain cautiously optimistic. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=271.46s)]
*  A deal will be signed though. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=273.06s)]
*  They point to previous rounds of ceasefire negotiations that saw Israeli prime minister [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=274.58s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu insert new demands at the 11th hour, something that we covered extensively. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=277.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=282.38s)]
*  As you know, something that we talked about quite a bit is the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=284.62s)]
*  added erroneous clauses, poison, poison pill amendments and provisions into the ceasefire [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  negotiation with the hopes of extending it, you know, to be to the aftermath of the election [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=295.86s)]
*  to I guess, reconsider how he will move forward depending on whether it's Donald Trump who [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=303.02s)]
*  won or Joe Biden who won. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=307.66s)]
*  That's the situation that we're that's the situation that we're facing, but it seems [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=310.3s)]
*  like the American, it seems as though the American administration is not all that powerless. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  It turns out that they're so powerful that the incoming president could even not even [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=324.66s)]
*  well before he's even in power, the incoming president who was the president before Joe [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  Biden is capable of forcing America's most important ally, most powerful ally, most [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=334.56s)]
*  moral nation in the Middle East, the only democracy in the Middle East to actually finally [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=342.08s)]
*  come to terms with an agreement that has been on the table since the 2nd of July, an agreement [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=346.94s)]
*  that was previously brought forth by Hamas all the way back in May. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=353.56s)]
*  So how does that happen? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=357.46s)]
*  Is Donald Trump an incredible statesman? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=358.68s)]
*  Is he a fantastic diplomat? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=360.76s)]
*  Is he Mr. Art of the deal art of the steel? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=362.96s)]
*  Is that why he was capable of doing this? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=365.76s)]
*  Wasn't Joe Biden, Mr. foreign policy? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=368.64s)]
*  I thought he was a foreign policy expert without a PhD, devoid, devoid of a PhD, but he's just [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=370.88s)]
*  that good. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=376.4s)]
*  Turns out Donald Trump is better. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=378.0s)]
*  Is that the case? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  Or did Donald Trump actually successfully appau knowing full well the cards that America [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=380.24s)]
*  holds in this process? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=385.47999999999996s)]
*  The same cards that Joe Biden refused to play despite the fact that he had played those [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=388.24s)]
*  all the way back in 2021 when he stopped Israel's further incursion into Gaza. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=392.38s)]
*  I will forever repeat that America holds all the cards. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=396.46000000000004s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=479.7s)]
*  The difference this time, however, is the president elect Donald Trump has made very [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=480.86s)]
*  clear his demands that a deal be reached before his inauguration on January 20th. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=483.14s)]
*  The terms of the deal being negotiated are largely consistent with what was on the table [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=487.02s)]
*  last May when outgoing president Joe Biden first announced it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=490.09999999999997s)]
*  Biden allowed Netanyahu to stream roll him for months, rewarding Israel with billions [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=493.21999999999997s)]
*  of dollars in arms transfers of political support. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=496.42s)]
*  After rejecting that bar deal since that time, tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=498.34s)]
*  have been killed and maimed and an unknown number of Israeli captives killed either by [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=502.18s)]
*  their captors or Israeli strikes. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=505.98s)]
*  All the while the administration and his backers repeatedly assured voters in the U S that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=508.46s)]
*  Biden and vice president Kamala Harris were working tirelessly around the clock to achieve [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=511.5s)]
*  a fire deal and erroneous claim elevated by the likes of even Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=516.18s)]
*  That was probably one of the lowest points. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=522.74s)]
*  The fact that Trump emerged as the decisive player in pushing a potential ceasefire forward [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=525.46s)]
*  is evidence that Biden never used the full powers available to a sitting U S president [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=531.1s)]
*  to seal the deal in the summer. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=535.66s)]
*  While Trump has publicly repeated his threat that he will unleash hell on Hamas if the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=537.26s)]
*  Israeli hostages are not freed, his pressure has not been solely focused on Hamas. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=540.02s)]
*  Trump and his aides have made clear to Netanyahu that the president elect expects Israel to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=543.86s)]
*  comply with his demands to what's really interesting is considering that it wasn't Hamas that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=546.9399999999999s)]
*  was spoiling the fire negotiations and it was always Israel that was spoiling the ceasefire [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=551.5s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=556.38s)]
*  The only difference between Donald Trump and Joseph Robin at Brandon is who they chose [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=557.38s)]
*  to apply pressure to at all. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  And the party that Trump is seemingly applying pressure to is Israel. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=564.38s)]
*  I understand there's been a handshake and they're getting it finished and maybe by the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=568.54s)]
*  end of the week Trump told Newsmax Monday night for sure part of Trump's motivation [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=571.42s)]
*  involves humiliating Biden claiming victory for fleeing not freeing the hostages. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=575.52s)]
*  I think what Trump is trying to do is clean house and start a new slate and I'm sure that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=579.54s)]
*  he has a lot of ideas about how he's going to reward Israel and then Yahoo once this is [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=583.62s)]
*  done said Sami Al-Ariyan a prominent Palestinian analyst and a director of the center of Islamic [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=586.54s)]
*  global affairs at Istanbul Zion University. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=590.82s)]
*  You can never trust what Netanyahu says or does but I think new factor here is that the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=593.06s)]
*  new Trump administration does not want this headache which would distract from higher [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=596.5799999999999s)]
*  priorities on Trump's agenda for weeks. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=599.6s)]
*  Trump's new Middle East special envoy real estate tycoon Steve Witkoff has participated [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=602.14s)]
*  directly in the negotiations. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=605.78s)]
*  The Israeli newspaper Hirats reported last weekend Witkoff forced Netanyahu despite objections [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=607.62s)]
*  of the prime minister's aides Witkoff's blunt reaction took them by surprise. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=611.66s)]
*  He explained to them his salty English that Shabbat was of no interest to him. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=615.92s)]
*  His message was OK. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=619.22s)]
*  That's that's crazy. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=620.54s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=622.62s)]
*  Witkoff is forced Israel to that. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=623.86s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  That right there is old school gangster style that is ultimately very disrespectful but [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=627.0600000000001s)]
*  deliberate. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=636.1s)]
*  That is absolutely something that you do because Witkoff is Jewish I think isn't he. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=638.1s)]
*  So he knows he knows the importance of Shabbat. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=644.0200000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=649.0600000000001s)]
*  He knows the important he knows what message that sends to not only the entire nation state [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=649.98s)]
*  of Israel but that message that sends to you know Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=657.1s)]
*  Apologies what a Shabbat Shabbat is Saturday is a day of rest where some Jewish people [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=662.62s)]
*  Orthodox Jews and you know some conservative Jews as well do not work from sun up to sun [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=670.22s)]
*  down Jewish sab Sabbath. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=676.62s)]
*  It's a Saturday. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=679.2199999999999s)]
*  So and there's a lot of rules around it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=680.7399999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of rules around it like you can hire a Shabbos goi but like you can't [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=683.3s)]
*  you're not supposed to work at all. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=689.18s)]
*  And by that I mean you're not supposed to operate any electronic equipment. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=690.5799999999999s)]
*  You can't even change the channel on your TV. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=693.9399999999999s)]
*  This is why Jewish hospitals in the in the New York metropolitan area will literally [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=696.52s)]
*  have elevators that stop at every single floor on Saturdays because you're not allowed to [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=701.66s)]
*  get in a car or carry keys or even press the button on an elevator. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=707.42s)]
*  So so in any case it's pretty significant. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=712.98s)]
*  And this is a deliberate method of disrespect from the Trump team. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=717.5s)]
*  Witkoff is openly saying I don't give a shit about your religion. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=724.22s)]
*  I don't care about like what your what your day of rest looks like. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=728.42s)]
*  You only do that not because time is of the essence. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=733.42s)]
*  You do that specifically to undermine the person you're talking to. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=736.46s)]
*  It sounds something that Trump would probably do. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=741.74s)]
*  Has the song given time for the Bernie interview. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=744.38s)]
*  Yes you missed it. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=746.46s)]
*  The proposed ceasefire deal according to the leaked draft of the three phase agreement [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=747.82s)]
*  framework Hamas will release 33 Israelis held in Gaza some alive some deceased. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=752.06s)]
*  These will be women children under the age of 19 elderly people and injured or sick [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=756.26s)]
*  civilians in turn Israel released 30 Palestinian children or minors or women. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=759.26s)]
*  For the five female Israeli soldiers being held the text says 50 Palestinian prisoners [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=763.02s)]
*  will be freed. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=766.3000000000001s)]
*  The exchange will begin with the release of the three Israelis and then continue in small [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=767.4200000000001s)]
*  groups over the course of seven weeks. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=770.26s)]
*  Among the Palestinians to be freed would be 47 people who were re-arrested by Israel following [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=772.34s)]

*  During this period there would be a temporary cessation of military operations by both sides. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=783.46s)]
*  Throughout this first phase of the potential ceasefire Israel military forces will gradually [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=787.54s)]
*  withdraw from various positions in Gaza and forcibly display palaces will be permitted [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=791.38s)]

*  and we are no longer the decisive factor. Smaltrish called the potential deal [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1049.58s)]
*  a catastrophe, posting on X. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1052.58s)]

*  cleanse the entire strip, to finally take control of humanitarian aid [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1058.58s)]
*  from Hamas and open the gates of Hell on Gaza until Hamas [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1061.58s)]
*  surrenders completely and all the hostages are returned. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1064.58s)]

*  genocide, ethnically cleanse the Palestinian strip. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1070.8999999999999s)]

*  as DropSite's very own Ryan Grim also reports the fact that Ben-Gavir [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1078.8999999999999s)]

*  Oh, they're doing a context note to what Itamar Ben-Gavir is saying. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1100.22s)]
*  It includes the release of hundreds of murderous terrorists from prisons. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1103.22s)]
*  This is not a hard choice that must be made to return the kidnaps. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1106.22s)]
*  A conscious choice of the cost of the lives of many other Israeli citizens [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1109.22s)]
*  over the past year through our political power. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1112.22s)]
*  We have managed to prevent this deal from coming to fruition time after time. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1115.22s)]
*  That is crazy. So why after taking a hundred billion, no, a hundred [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1118.22s)]
*  million from Adelson, would Trump force Israel to not to not [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1121.22s)]
*  do what they are already in the process of doing? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1124.22s)]
*  I'll tell you why. One, this is a major victory for Donald Trump. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1127.54s)]
*  And that's important. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1130.54s)]
*  OK, that's really, really important. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1133.54s)]
*  Two, this way you don't let them permanently annex North Gaza, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1136.54s)]
*  but you give a moment. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1139.54s)]
*  You allow Israel to basically lick its wounds, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1142.54s)]
*  rearm and redeploy potentially down the line [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1145.54s)]
*  and engage in a permanent occupation of the West Bank. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1148.54s)]
*  Not a permanent occupation, sorry, permanent annexation [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1151.54s)]
*  of the West Bank. Israel currently with its [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1154.86s)]
*  military personnel and its internal conflict [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1157.86s)]
*  is incredibly weak. Its economy is weak. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1160.86s)]
*  Its politics are weak. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1163.86s)]
*  There's a lot of crisis happening in Israel. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1166.86s)]
*  So they're not militarily ready, I think, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1169.86s)]
*  to permanently annex the West Bank. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1172.86s)]
*  This is what Mary Maddelson wants. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1175.86s)]
*  This is what Mary Maddelson openly communicated to Donald Trump [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1178.86s)]
*  and gave $100 million to Donald Trump to do. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1182.1799999999998s)]
*  That's what I think is going on. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1185.1799999999998s)]
*  OK, that's what I think is happening. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1188.1799999999998s)]
*  Now, I don't know, because there are some [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1191.1799999999998s)]
*  self-inflicted wounds in the process of a permanent [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1194.1799999999998s)]
*  occupation and permanent annexation of the West Bank. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1197.1799999999998s)]
*  The wounds would be that you would all but [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1200.1799999999998s)]
*  completely finalize the apartheid structure [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1203.1799999999998s)]
*  and it would make it completely indefensible. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1206.1799999999998s)]
*  Now, one might say, well, Hassan, Israel has [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1209.5s)]
*  conducted a genocide for the past year and it doesn't [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1212.5s)]
*  matter if it's consistently indefensible. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1215.5s)]
*  Western allies have repeatedly attacked Israel [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1218.5s)]
*  for doing this. They still kept doing it because as long as [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1221.5s)]
*  America has their back, they will be able to do whatever [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1224.5s)]
*  and they've learned a very terrible lesson here that they [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1227.5s)]
*  will get away with it. And to that I say true. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1230.5s)]
*  Having said that, however, a permanent annexation of the West Bank [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1233.5s)]
*  basically comes with the recognition that it's just a singular [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1236.82s)]
*  solitary state of Israel, which accelerates, in my opinion, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1239.82s)]
*  the demise of the Israeli apartheid in its entirety, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1242.82s)]
*  not dissimilar to South African apartheid. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1245.82s)]
*  That's what I think. But who knows? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1248.82s)]
*  That is one of the reasons why I think Israel might not [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1251.82s)]
*  permanently annex the West Bank, is what I'm saying, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1254.82s)]
*  rather than keep stressing the areas that are still [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1257.82s)]
*  under the control of Palestinians, which is [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1260.82s)]
*  the same as the areas that are still under the control of [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1264.1399999999999s)]
*  Palestinians and keep doing military incursions into areas [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1267.1399999999999s)]
*  that are under the control of Palestinians as they've [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1270.1399999999999s)]
*  done consistently over this past year. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1273.1399999999999s)]
*  And this way they will be able to do that [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1276.1399999999999s)]
*  a little bit better, I guess. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1279.1399999999999s)]
*  So it's interesting that I mentioned that this is exactly [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1282.1399999999999s)]
*  this was going to happen, by the way, like exactly [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1285.1399999999999s)]
*  what has happened so far. I said was going to happen [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1288.1399999999999s)]
*  with Trump dealing with Israel if he wins. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1291.46s)]
*  And now it's unfolding in front of our eyes. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1294.46s)]
*  So once again, if you are taking a victory lap [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1297.46s)]
*  to own the libs, I guess, to say, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1300.46s)]
*  because the liberals are taking, we're taking victory laps, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1303.46s)]
*  saying Trump is going to be far more bloody and far more [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1306.46s)]
*  deadly to the Palestinians. Yeah, I hope you enjoy all of your [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1309.46s)]
*  Gazan relatives getting murdered under Trump or whatever, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1312.46s)]
*  because that's what liberals are saying, because they're [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1315.46s)]
*  beating the Palestinians. But then there are also leftists [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1318.78s)]
*  or even not leftists, but like Arab voters that voted for [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1321.78s)]
*  Donald Trump, saying like, well, he delivered on his promise [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1324.78s)]
*  to us, I would simply state [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1327.78s)]
*  I would simply state that once again, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1330.78s)]
*  I do not think Trump's ambitions in [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1333.78s)]
*  Israel are going to be all that different from [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1336.78s)]
*  Joe Biden. Forum policy is unit party. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1339.78s)]
*  Forum policy only goes in one direction, and that is [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1342.78s)]
*  bloodshed and more war and Republicans have a tendency to [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1345.78s)]
*  dramatically increase said bloodshed. Okay. So while I am [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1350.1s)]
*  hoping that this will lead to a permanent cessation of [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1354.66s)]
*  hostilities, I don't know how permanent that those cessation [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1358.74s)]
*  of hostilities will actually be if that makes sense. Okay, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1364.66s)]
*  that's all I'm saying. It might be it might seem like it is cast [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1368.46s)]
*  aside as Israel gets the regroup, it might seem like it's [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1373.02s)]
*  the the war has passed, the genocide is done, and everyone [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1377.94s)]
*  gets to recover and try to rebuild. Having said that, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1382.22s)]
*  however, I think the only rebuilding and recovery that will [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1386.74s)]
*  happen in this process will be Israel rebuilding its military [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1389.7s)]
*  capabilities as fast as possible in an effort to increase the [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1393.72s)]
*  pressure upon the Palestinians that it in the territories that [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1399.54s)]
*  he that it occupies currently, illegally enforcing its [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1403.02s)]
*  sovereignty over Palestinians. And we'll, I think, continue on [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1407.18s)]
*  the pathway of continue on the pathway of destruction. Do you [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1412.42s)]
*  think Israel will start again after new next presidential [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1417.22s)]
*  election especially with Democrats elected? Yeah, job [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1420.46s)]
*  read dropped is Tyler Hitler Vera video. Okay, we'll get to [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1423.22s)]
*  that later today. Calm down now. In advance of signing an [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1426.24s)]
*  agreement, according to Israeli media reports, Netanyahu would [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1430.64s)]
*  need approval from a security cabinet but not a full vote in [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1432.68s)]
*  the Knesset Israeli part Israel's Parliament, Israel's [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1434.76s)]

*  Among the technical issues still being discussed among mediators [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1440.48s)]
*  Tuesday was the exact positioning of Israeli forces in a new [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1442.84s)]
*  buffer zone inside of Gaza. And Yahoo and his aides have [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1445.44s)]
*  emphasized this element in their campaign to sell the deal [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1447.84s)]
*  domestically by implying that they could resume the war at any [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1449.76s)]
*  moment with forces remaining in strike position until all [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1452.0s)]

*  waves the deal is making in Israel Netanyahu will almost [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1457.32s)]
*  certainly claim it as a victory in his larger agenda in the [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1459.8799999999999s)]
*  Middle East extending from Gaza to Lebanon to Syria and Iran. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1462.72s)]
*  Many of Netanyahu's major achievements occurred after he [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1466.0s)]
*  rejected the Biden's deal. The Biden deal last summer, the [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1468.36s)]
*  killing of Hamas leaders, Yahu's in war and Ismail Haniya as [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1471.52s)]

*  Lebanon, including its leader Hassan Nazarallah. Netanyahu is [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1477.16s)]
*  also taking credit for enabling regime change in Syria and [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1480.36s)]

*  offered Netanyahu in return for his acu essence to the Gaza [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1487.24s)]
*  deal. Trump has portrayed himself as the most pro-Israel [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1490.56s)]
*  president in history and has stacked his incoming [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1493.0s)]

*  Trump and Netanyahu share a desire to see regime change in [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1513.12s)]
*  Iran or at a minimum to target its nuclear facilities and its [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1515.08s)]

*  Trump officially declared Israeli territory during his [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1525.32s)]

*  very supportive of the Israeli enterprise, the Israeli project. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1530.6s)]
*  But I think he wants to help them in different ways rather [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1533.52s)]
*  than achieve what they call total victory over something that [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1535.9599999999998s)]
*  he could see is not attainable in the near future, said Al-Ariyan. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1538.48s)]
*  Netanyahu could go back to his old tricks and again, he could [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1542.48s)]
*  make up some excuse to resume his war so that he can stay more [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1544.8400000000001s)]
*  in power and basically shuffle the deck again, hoping that [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1548.0s)]
*  Trump would be exhausted and let him do what he wants. Al-Ariyan [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1550.04s)]
*  also believes that if the Gaza war remains stalled, Netanyahu [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1552.76s)]
*  will intensify its focus on the West Bank. That's what I think [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1555.28s)]
*  as well. Since October 7th attacks, Israel's way smaller [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1557.56s)]
*  scale war in the West Bank engaged in limited ground [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1560.4s)]
*  invasions and mass arrests. There will possibly be an end to [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1562.44s)]
*  the Gaza war, but there will now, there will be now another [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1564.96s)]
*  war in the West Bank, Al-Ariyan said. It may not be on [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1568.12s)]
*  the same scale, but it would be as vicious from the settlers [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1571.84s)]
*  from the Netanyahu government. That's that is in line with what [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1574.76s)]
*  my assessment is as well. But on that note, let's see what [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1578.6399999999999s)]

*  for months. From the talks in Qatar, confirmation that the [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1629.36s)]
*  main obstacles had been overcome. Questions of implementation [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1632.76s)]

*  homes in the north. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1698.3600000000001s)]
*  Palestine has voted for Hamas, a terrorist regime that attacked [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1699.2s)]
*  his neighbor. You clapped him before he could get his thought [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1701.64s)]
*  out. That's man, there's no free speech in here. Hold on, let me [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1705.48s)]
*  read the rest of it. And kill thousands of people. What other [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1708.88s)]
*  country would stand for that? Certainly not America. That's [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1711.24s)]
*  really interesting. Now, now understand that Israel voted for [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1713.52s)]
*  for Likud, a terrorist regime that attacked its neighbor and [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  has consistently occupied its neighboring state as a settler [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1722.6s)]
*  colonial enterprise, constantly dominating the lives of more [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1727.2s)]
*  than 10 million people. What group of individuals would stand [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1732.72s)]
*  for that? Certainly not America. Also, Palestinians have [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1738.72s)]
*  historically gotten a refugee in bordering Muslim countries but [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1742.96s)]
*  no longer given previous incidents. So how strange. So [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1745.1200000000001s)]
*  how to manage that situation. Also, Israelis came into the [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1747.48s)]
*  region from the Western world. What are you saying? This is [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1752.32s)]
*  literally carbon copy Nazi arguments. People who want to [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1755.92s)]
*  defend Israel routinely refuse to recognize that considering [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1760.2s)]
*  that Zionism as an ideology is inherently a fascist one built [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1764.8s)]
*  around an ethno religious supremacist ideology that [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1769.8s)]
*  constantly seeks to destroy its opponents, those who are lesser [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1774.24s)]
*  the that those who are of different religious background [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1778.04s)]
*  don't realize that this is the exact same argument that Nazis [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1781.44s)]
*  made about Jewish people. And neo Nazis to this day still make [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1784.24s)]
*  the same exact argument about Jewish people. They say, Oh, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1787.84s)]
*  Jews have been kicked out of every country that they've been [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1790.1599999999999s)]
*  in. Hmm, I wonder why. Think about that. Do you have no shame? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1792.24s)]
*  No critical thinking skills? No way to understand the situation [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1797.0s)]
*  that you are quite literally doing the neo Nazi argument when [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1800.76s)]
*  you talk about Palestinians? Yeah, Arabs to just go to a [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1803.5600000000002s)]
*  different Arab country, right? Like, I don't get it. That makes [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1806.24s)]
*  no sense to me. It's the exact it is the exact same argument. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1808.72s)]
*  Orthophs still habitable, and aid would be increased to 600 [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1814.48s)]
*  trucks a day. Israel would withdraw troops from areas such [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1818.04s)]
*  as the net Zareem corridor, which it had wanted to retain to [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1822.04s)]
*  prevent weapon transfer to the north. It would though keep [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1825.36s)]
*  troops in the Philadelphia corridor on the Egyptian border. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1828.28s)]
*  In parallel, negotiations would continue ahead of phase two, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1831.4399999999998s)]
*  which would see mainly male soldier hostages exchanged for [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1835.28s)]
*  more Palestinian prisoners and a full Israeli military [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1838.8s)]
*  withdrawal, including from the Egyptian border, something [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1841.7199999999998s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu had long resisted for Israeli hostage [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1844.9599999999998s)]
*  families fresh from a meeting with the Prime Minister, the [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1848.04s)]
*  lack of full agreement on that second phase causing concern. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1850.8s)]
*  We are demanding from Prime Minister Netanyahu from Qatar, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1854.96s)]
*  from President elect Trump to agree upon all the stages of [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1858.92s)]
*  negotiation and get all the hostages back. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1864.52s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister also under pressure from an Israeli [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1868.84s)]
*  right that had expected very different things of a Trump [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1871.64s)]
*  presidency. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1874.48s)]
*  His far right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gviye [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1878.72s)]
*  threatening to walk out of the coalition of what he called a [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1882.0s)]
*  deal made for Hamas. The third and final stage of that deal [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1885.08s)]
*  would see a massive reconstruction effort in Gaza, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1889.8s)]
*  the US Secretary of State saying President Trump's team [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1892.68s)]
*  Yeah, imagine if the Germans invaded the US claiming is their [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1895.52s)]
*  territory and they told all the Americans has just moved to [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1899.1200000000001s)]
*  Canada because you both speak English. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1901.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it would take over work already started. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1903.68s)]
*  For many months, we've been working intensive with our [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1907.3600000000001s)]
*  partners to develop a detailed post conflict plan that would [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1909.4s)]
*  allow Israel to fully withdraw from Gaza, prevent Hamas from [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1913.3600000000001s)]
*  filling back in and provide for Gaza's governments security [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1916.3200000000002s)]
*  and reconstruction. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1920.44s)]
*  But here too, there's huge uncertainty Hamas one party to a [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1921.5600000000002s)]
*  deal designed eventually to replace it as Gaza's governing [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1925.16s)]
*  entity. For all the skepticism about where this deal may end, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1928.5600000000002s)]
*  one thing goes unquestioned by Israel's hostage families and [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1931.88s)]
*  Gaza's civilians alike. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1935.76s)]
*  It must at least begin. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1938.16s)]
*  Well, in a moment, we'll hear the view of the Palestinians. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1939.96s)]
*  But first, I spoke earlier to Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1942.3200000000002s)]
*  Baskin. I started by asking what has led to the deal being [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1946.1200000000001s)]
*  potentially struck now. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1950.4s)]
*  The big difference between what we've seen over the past months [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1952.5600000000002s)]
*  and right now is January 20th, when the big T enters the White [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1955.8400000000001s)]
*  House once again. And all of them are putting the screws on Prime [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1960.0400000000002s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu on the Qataris and the Egyptians who are [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1963.6000000000001s)]
*  putting the screws on Hamas. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1966.28s)]
*  And all this pressure is working because we're really, really, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1968.12s)]
*  really close to an agreement. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1971.6399999999999s)]
*  But hang on a minute. President Biden has at least told us that [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1973.36s)]
*  he's been putting the screws on the Israeli prime minister [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1976.76s)]
*  consistently over the last year and a half or so, or since [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1979.36s)]
*  October the 7th. And it hasn't worked. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1983.36s)]
*  So is Trump's thumb screw much more powerful than Biden's? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1985.76s)]
*  Well, it could also be that Biden wasn't really putting the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1991.3999999999999s)]
*  screws on Israel because we know at the same time that he said [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1993.84s)]
*  he's drawing red lines and Israel better do this and that. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=1996.52s)]
*  He was sending more and more weapons and more and more money [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2000.24s)]
*  to Israel. So there was no real pressure felt by Prime Minister [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2002.8799999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu from President Biden. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2007.32s)]
*  And when there's a Democratic administration and a prime [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2009.8799999999999s)]
*  minister like Netanyahu in office, he can always go to his [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2013.04s)]
*  Republican friends. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2016.04s)]
*  Now Netanyahu has no one to go to to complain about the president [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2017.36s)]
*  putting pressure on Israel when it's the president himself from [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2021.6s)]
*  the Republican Party. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2024.6s)]
*  And in the interim, waiting for this thing to get implemented, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2025.76s)]
*  another 10,000 people have been killed. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2029.3999999999999s)]
*  Another 10,000 people have been killed. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2031.8799999999999s)]
*  A lot of Israeli soldiers have been killed. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2033.9199999999998s)]
*  A lot more suffering has taken place on both sides of the border, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2036.8s)]
*  mainly in the Gaza Strip. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2039.84s)]
*  It's really horrible. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2041.8799999999999s)]
*  OK, if this deal now goes ahead, does that mean the end of the [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2042.9599999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu government? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2046.3999999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think so. Netanyahu has a majority in his government [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2047.8799999999999s)]
*  to pull off the deal. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2050.64s)]
*  Even if the far extreme right wing opposes it, he will still be [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2051.8399999999997s)]
*  in power. The danger to Netanyahu's coalition or to his government [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2056.08s)]
*  is that when the war is over, the call for new elections will [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2060.3199999999997s)]
*  grow louder and the demanding of the Israeli public for an [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2063.7599999999998s)]
*  national commission of inquiry to determine how Israel failed to [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2069.72s)]
*  protect itself on October 7th. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2074.16s)]
*  What led to that and the dysfunctional nature of the Israeli [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2075.8399999999997s)]
*  government since then will all come to a head. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2078.96s)]
*  But could he escape defeat in new elections? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2081.16s)]
*  Well, all the polls since October 7th of last year show that [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2084.6s)]
*  Netanyahu cannot win another election. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2087.92s)]
*  The size of his coalition or the ability to form a new government, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2090.2s)]
*  the majority in the parliament, is not there since October 7th. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2093.4s)]
*  Finally, and briefly, if you don't mind, six months before the [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2097.68s)]
*  Oslo Accords were signed on the South Lawn of the White House, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2100.84s)]
*  Bill Clinton was president, Yasser Arafat was there, Yitzhak Rabin. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2103.96s)]
*  You know, the rest is history, as they say, but no one thought at [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2107.6s)]
*  that stage it was possible. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2110.72s)]
*  And then it was. Do you think something similar could happen on [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2111.9599999999996s)]
*  the South Lawn of the Trump White House? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2114.4399999999996s)]
*  Precisely. And it's not only that example you're giving. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2116.8799999999997s)]
*  We can talk about the Berlin Wall. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2119.4399999999996s)]
*  We can talk about Nelson Mandela. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2120.9199999999996s)]
*  We can talk about Syria and Bashar al-Assad that no one predicted [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2122.68s)]

*  Despite all the horror of the last year? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2135.44s)]
*  Because of all the horror of the last year, there are still seven [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2137.52s)]
*  million Israeli Jews and seven million Palestinian Arabs between [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2140.48s)]
*  the river and the sea. They're not going anywhere. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2143.68s)]

*  We can't keep doing this. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2147.92s)]

*  Thank you. Well, I'm now joined by Mustafa Bagouti, the General [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2151.4s)]
*  Secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative and member of [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2154.2400000000002s)]

*  Let me start with that note of optimism from Gershon Baskin there. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2162.92s)]
*  Although this has been the darkest hour for so many, he thinks [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2166.36s)]
*  that this, because of the horrors of the last year, something positive [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2171.04s)]
*  might come from it, both for the Palestinians and for the Israelis. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2174.96s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2178.32s)]
*  I agree that something good could happen, but... [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2178.92s)]
*  Peace, peace with the Nazis. Brother, it don't matter. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2182.52s)]
*  If you are... Think about it like this. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2185.92s)]
*  During the Holocaust, if at any given moment, if the Nazis were like, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2188.7200000000003s)]
*  all right, we've taken enough of a punishment. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2192.68s)]
*  We're just going to stop killing all of the people in our death camps. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2195.56s)]
*  Do you think, do you think that people in the death camps would be like, no, no, no, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2199.2799999999997s)]
*  hold on, keep fighting all the way through. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2203.08s)]
*  No, of course, of course not. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2205.72s)]
*  Yeah. For the Palestinians, for the Palestinians that are suffering [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2207.52s)]
*  for the innocent Palestinians are being ruthlessly slaughtered. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2210.8799999999997s)]
*  This is a good thing. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2213.3999999999996s)]
*  Think about what has happened thus far. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2214.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yesterday, drops [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2216.6s)]
*  I reported on how the PA is slaughtering West Bank Palestinians [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2217.56s)]
*  under the guise of eliminating Iran-backed outlaws and a bid to show [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2219.96s)]
*  the Americans that they can be trusted to run stuff. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2222.56s)]
*  The report mentioned how the PA [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2224.88s)]
*  requested $600 million in arms to do so. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2225.96s)]
*  It seems that Israel is using them as the initial force to weaken West Bank [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2228.36s)]
*  militants and displace and murder the residents prior to the annexation. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2231.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is an escalation of what the PA has done [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2234.2400000000002s)]
*  as a mechanism of the Israeli security apparatus in perpetuity. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2238.92s)]
*  This is the reason why the Palestinian authority is literally [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2244.0s)]
*  the second least popular institution in the region, according to Palestinians. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2247.32s)]
*  Number one being Israel, of course. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2252.6400000000003s)]
*  Number two being followed closely the Palestinian Authority. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2254.76s)]
*  That is conditioned by a different American position in general [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2258.8s)]
*  and the different position of the Western countries. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2264.7200000000003s)]
*  If these countries tell Israel enough is enough and you have to endure occupation. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2268.0800000000004s)]
*  Any question? What are Arabic countries around Palestine doing to help? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2273.2400000000002s)]
*  Why is the Western world seemingly louder? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2275.96s)]
*  Right wingers around me bring this up and I don't know how to reply properly. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2277.48s)]
*  I mean, ask them who the most powerful military is. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2280.36s)]
*  The most powerful country on the planet backs Israel unconditionally. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2283.64s)]
*  The most powerful country on the planet uses Israel as a extension [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2286.76s)]
*  of its imperialist ambitions in the region and therefore has cut out [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2290.36s)]
*  security contracts with every single vassal state in the region. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2294.92s)]
*  OK, many of these other nations would not stand in the way that they currently [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2298.36s)]
*  in the way that they currently do without consistent American dollars. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2303.64s)]
*  Many of these countries would not have the necessary security apparatus [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2307.92s)]
*  to be able to stop their population from overthrowing them. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2312.6s)]
*  OK, the countries that do not actually play ball with American empire [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2317.68s)]
*  end up getting destroyed, even if they also aren't exactly great people either. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2323.04s)]
*  They're not like Bashar al-Assad is a great example of this. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2327.64s)]
*  OK, Bashar al-Assad is a ruthless autocrat, terrible tyrant. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2331.2000000000003s)]
*  OK, not a good guy and also incredibly incompetent on top of everything else. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2336.92s)]
*  Like not only was he ruthless, but he was also incredibly incompetent. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2342.44s)]
*  That much is a 100% certainty. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2345.04s)]
*  OK, but Bashar al-Assad also in all of that incompetence, allowed Iran to utilize [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2348.0800000000004s)]
*  Syria as a important part of the logistical hub in weapons transfers to Hezbollah [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2353.6000000000004s)]
*  in Lebanon. OK, so he had to go. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2359.96s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2363.92s)]
*  Like, even if you're not fully on board with Palestinian emancipation, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2364.92s)]
*  even if you marginally represent a threat, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2370.44s)]
*  even if you marginally represent a threat to Israel. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2373.6000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, there is perhaps no greater demonstration that Assad was not [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2376.48s)]
*  that large of a threat to Israel ultimately, because he had a freaking navy. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2380.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. And he had, I say, because he no longer has any sort [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2385.5600000000004s)]
*  of military equipment because Israel blew it all up after he was overthrown. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2389.48s)]
*  OK, there goes another shitty Syria take. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2394.36s)]
*  OK, dude, sure. You're right. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2397.68s)]
*  That's a bad Syria take anyway, regardless of his incompetence. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2399.92s)]
*  He didn't demonstrate enough of a threat to Israel that they actually actively [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2405.04s)]
*  undermined his military. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2409.88s)]
*  OK, except for except for the logistical hubs that existed within Syria [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2412.28s)]
*  that were being that that were, you know, manufacturing weapons [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2418.48s)]
*  or transferring weapons into Hezbollah, into Lebanon through Syria. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2422.68s)]
*  OK, HDS is better than Bashar. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2427.64s)]
*  The PLO is a joke. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2430.12s)]
*  Atheist fucks the US funds the Egyptian military without that. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2431.44s)]
*  They will go bankrupt and another Arab Spring will happen. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2434.32s)]

*  our jihadists like, come on, bro. He reformed. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2470.36s)]

*  Sunni Islamist or whatever, or a Salafist. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2479.72s)]

*  I have long maintained the position that the people of Syria [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2484.04s)]
*  will see what happens, but most likely the people of Syria will suffer [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2488.2s)]
*  as a consequence of whoever whoever controls Syria regardless. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2491.36s)]
*  When you look at the way that these nations have been carved out anyway, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2496.2s)]

*  They eliminated Assad. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2533.08s)]
*  They cooked Russia in the process. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2535.0s)]

*  I ultimately do not fault people for the actions that they've committed [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2592.52s)]
*  or the actions that they've taken as long as they can actually reform. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2595.88s)]
*  Unlike HDS, I'm not talking about HDS when I say the fake reform [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2598.64s)]
*  so that they're more, you know, appealing to Western interests [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2602.2799999999997s)]
*  as they dominate the country. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2606.24s)]
*  I'm simply talking about people who take on this position, take this role. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2608.7599999999998s)]
*  And it goes and it's the same for the IDF as well. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2613.16s)]
*  OK, as long as after your after your experience that you understand [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2616.04s)]
*  that it was, you know, unacceptable, wrong and you work to offer, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2622.8399999999997s)]
*  you work to atone, then you're good. Great. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2627.96s)]
*  When I say the Israeli occupying force is a terrorist entity, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2631.96s)]
*  what I mean by that is that the institution in and of itself is doing terrorism, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2636.68s)]
*  you know, and the same goes for and the same goes for American military members as well. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2641.12s)]
*  This is a consistent position I've held in perpetuity. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2646.76s)]
*  OK, it's partially because I understand where people starting position is. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2650.48s)]
*  I understand where people come from. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2654.8s)]
*  I understand how people make these decisions. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2656.2s)]
*  America doesn't even have mandatory conscription. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2658.8s)]
*  And yet I still understand that, like for many people, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2660.96s)]
*  the poverty draft is very real. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2664.12s)]
*  So for upward social mobility and a chance to get a shitty communications degree [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2666.2s)]
*  and enter the job market with PTSD five years after all of your peers, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2670.12s)]
*  you do an untold amounts of an untold amount of violence all around the globe. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2674.88s)]
*  And then you're permanently scarred and broken as a consequence of that. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2680.16s)]
*  If you recognize that and then actively work to undermine it [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2682.72s)]
*  for future generations, then you're good in my book, because at the end of the day, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2685.92s)]
*  that's just how people operate and in your system, you're literally so stupid. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2690.3199999999997s)]
*  Turkey's military is not that advanced. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2695.12s)]
*  That's racist. You're literally defending genocide. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2697.8s)]
*  What is Syria deal? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2700.2400000000002s)]
*  Were you born in US or Turkey? You're literally so stupid. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2701.48s)]
*  Wait, what? What am I? How am I defending genocide? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2703.92s)]
*  Turkey has mandatory army enrollment. Yes, it does. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2707.7200000000003s)]
*  Turkey's military is not that advanced. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2710.7200000000003s)]
*  Second largest military in NATO, second largest standing military in NATO. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2712.28s)]
*  Utilizing US weapons doesn't mean it's advanced. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2716.56s)]
*  OK, brother or sister, seemingly good enough. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2719.56s)]
*  All right, let's continue with apartheid. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2722.56s)]
*  And one genocide is enough. We don't need another one. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2724.56s)]
*  Then, yes, we can see a future of peace. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2728.0s)]
*  It all starts with one specific act, ending the Israeli illegalization. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2731.56s)]
*  And then we have the second largest military in the world. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2737.56s)]
*  And then we have the third largest military in the world. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2740.56s)]
*  So it's interesting that Gershon Baskin thought it was Donald Trump saying [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2743.56s)]
*  all hell will break loose if the hostages aren't released, was aimed actually at Netanyahu [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2750.56s)]
*  and not so much at Hamas, you know, all the Palestinians. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2756.56s)]
*  Do you think that Trump is good for you? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2760.56s)]
*  Damn, so she has Hassan Abiy, brother. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2762.56s)]
*  Ahmed Al-Sharaa is different using the new name. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2764.56s)]
*  His most recent interview showed a clear shift from his past. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2768.56s)]
*  And now he's a nation building mindset. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2770.56s)]
*  If you say so, your cause of bad feel. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2771.56s)]
*  Look, all I'm saying is all only time will tell. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2774.56s)]
*  OK, I don't think like, you know, getting a haircut and putting on a suit and tie [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2777.56s)]
*  automatically makes you, you know, it might make you aesthetically appealing to Western [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2784.56s)]
*  sensibilities, but I don't think it changes what you are interested in doing. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2790.56s)]
*  Syria is at the end of the day, a very diverse country. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2795.56s)]
*  And as far as I understand, like HTS is regional operations in the past, regional governance [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2798.56s)]
*  initiatives in the past were less than desirable. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2804.56s)]
*  Let's say also the crimes that we are reforming for in this process are crazy. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2808.56s)]
*  Like when you think about it, the crimes that you're reforming for that we're talking about [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2813.56s)]
*  are like beheading people. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2817.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2819.56s)]
*  I mean, it's not like, like, I don't know, call me crazy, but I feel like maybe this [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2821.56s)]
*  is my most like my least woke opinion, but I feel like once you're in ISIS territory [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2826.56s)]
*  or once you're in Al Qaeda territory, like when you're, when you have risen to through [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2832.56s)]
*  the ranks of Al Qaeda, I feel like that's, that's a bridge too far for me. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2837.56s)]
*  Like that's now you're in like serial killer territory. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2842.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2845.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2846.56s)]
*  Is that, am I not woke enough for this? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2847.56s)]
*  Am I crazy? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2850.56s)]
*  Maybe, maybe I'm crazy. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2851.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2853.56s)]
*  Like, yeah, sure. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2854.56s)]
*  He looks like Zelensky now, but like, I'm not immediately, I'm not going to be, you [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2855.56s)]
*  know, ready to accept the premise that he's a changed man. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2861.56s)]
*  That's why I say only time will tell, which I think is like a pretty, pretty, pretty [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2865.56s)]
*  understandable thing to say, right? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2871.56s)]
*  IDF that is literally killed hundreds of thousands of people is better than off-brand Al Qaeda [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2872.56s)]
*  Lamau. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2876.56s)]
*  When did I say that? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2877.56s)]
*  So pro reform of Nazis. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2879.56s)]
*  Oh, are you saying that I'm not in favor of like reforming HDS? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2881.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2886.56s)]
*  If for example, Benjamin and Yahoo tomorrow turned around and was like, oh, don't worry. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2887.56s)]
*  I've actually gotten woke. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2892.56s)]
*  Like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2893.56s)]
*  don't worry. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2898.56s)]
*  I've actually gotten woke. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2899.56s)]
*  Like I'm going to let the Palestinians breathe or whatever. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2900.56s)]
*  I wouldn't be inclined to believe him either. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2903.56s)]
*  If you're talking about like some random dude that rose up in arms or whatever that my man, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2905.56s)]
*  you're talking about, like, you know, you're, you're talking about reform when you're comparing [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2910.56s)]
*  a commander of Al Qaeda. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2915.0s)]
*  It's like saying that, I don't know, like Moshe Dayan was reformed later in his life [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2917.66s)]
*  or something. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2924.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2925.44s)]
*  It's like, nah, he wasn't. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2926.44s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2927.44s)]
*  No, still a terrorist, still a war criminal. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2928.44s)]
*  You know, it doesn't matter if he got government positions. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2930.92s)]
*  Like there's a difference between, you know, a random guy who was conscripted and then [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2934.7200000000003s)]
*  was like, this was inhumane. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2939.68s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2941.36s)]
*  I'm going to join breaking this islands now. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2942.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2944.82s)]
*  Versus Moshe Dayan or Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2945.82s)]
*  He was number four in Al Qaeda after Bin Laden's all here in Zarkawi. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2949.7200000000003s)]
*  Then he was number two in ISIS after Baghdadi, but now he's finally realizes being his dream [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2953.18s)]
*  of being number one in Syria. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2957.66s)]
*  Listen, stop. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2959.54s)]
*  People have the tendency, people have, he read Dara'a Najam Olu, Why Nations Fail, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2960.98s)]
*  and that book changes life. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2965.66s)]
*  A good book can change one's life. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2966.8199999999997s)]
*  Pause. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2969.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2970.2599999999998s)]
*  All you're telling me is he has leadership experience. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2971.2599999999998s)]
*  It depends on his behavior. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2972.98s)]
*  I mean, it depends on whether he will allow Israel to annex the West Bank, for instance, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2974.94s)]
*  which would kill completely the possibility of a Palestinian state. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2979.8199999999997s)]
*  It depends if at this very moment he did something positive, which is to pressure Netanyahu, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2984.14s)]
*  something that Biden couldn't do. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2991.02s)]
*  And only because there is a pressure from Trump on Netanyahu. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2993.42s)]
*  Bro, you want to Assad to stay in power? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2996.54s)]
*  Just admit it. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2998.8199999999997s)]
*  Assad is literally worse, bro. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=2999.8199999999997s)]
*  Let's talk about HTA is a better player now. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3000.8199999999997s)]
*  Assad is literally worse and where proof is on, he chopped people's heads off. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3003.98s)]
*  Where proof he chopped someone's heads off? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3007.8199999999997s)]
*  We are talking about an Al Qaeda commander. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3010.54s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3014.5s)]
*  Are we now whitewashing Al Qaeda? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3016.62s)]
*  What is happening in this chat? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3018.8999999999996s)]

*  You're being quite Islamophobic, sweetie, that we are seeing this deal happening. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3111.74s)]
*  This deal was there six months ago. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3116.46s)]
*  The Palestinian side had accepted the deal. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3120.06s)]
*  Netanyahu blocked it. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3123.1800000000003s)]
*  Biden, instead of blaming Netanyahu, lied and claimed that it was the Palestinians who [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3125.1s)]
*  blocked the deal. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3130.7000000000003s)]
*  And we lost in the course of the last six months, 10,000 Palestinian innocent people. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3131.82s)]
*  And in that course, he also allowed the killing of many Israeli prisoners. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3137.42s)]
*  So in reality, we are seeing now a difference, mainly because now Netanyahu understands he [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3142.78s)]
*  cannot play games with Trump. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3148.86s)]
*  And that means there is an opportunity. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3150.78s)]
*  But except cleansing and we will never accept to be subjugated to apartheid. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3153.1s)]
*  Got to leave it down. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3158.94s)]

*  This is actually a fantastic new thing that the Brandon administration did on its way out. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3161.6600000000003s)]
*  The U.S. has announced the lifting of the designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3167.98s)]
*  terror. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3171.58s)]
*  What a laughable thing that existed already for the record. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3172.2200000000003s)]
*  What a laughable thing. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3175.34s)]
*  What an I mean, it's not even laughable, actually. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3177.42s)]
*  It's incredibly cruel and horrifying. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3179.7400000000002s)]
*  Now, of course, he did this, but Donald Trump, I'm sure, will immediately, immediately [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3183.98s)]
*  undo this in the next six days. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3190.3s)]
*  He's live for us in Washington, D.C. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3193.7400000000002s)]
*  So first of all, just explain to us why Biden is removing Cuba from this list of state [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3197.1800000000003s)]
*  sponsors of terrorism now. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3202.54s)]
*  Well, this is something that's been under examination since essentially the Biden [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3204.22s)]
*  administration took over in the White House. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3208.14s)]
*  Donald Trump changed the designation as he was going out the door, in fact, on the 12th [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3210.46s)]
*  of January, 2021. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3214.7s)]
*  And the Biden administration criticized him for saying that essentially they were tying [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3216.46s)]
*  their hands for a while. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3220.7799999999997s)]
*  Now, they said they would undergo a review. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3222.22s)]
*  They've done that in 2022. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3224.3799999999997s)]
*  Anthony Blinken said that was still underway. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3226.62s)]
*  And here we are almost three years later. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3228.7799999999997s)]
*  And they said that's now done and they're removing the designation. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3231.34s)]
*  So what does it mean? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3234.46s)]
*  It means that Cuba is removed from the list that also includes North Korea, Syria. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3235.42s)]
*  We've done more terrorism to Cuba than Cuba has ever done to anybody. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3240.38s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's not even a question. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3243.1000000000004s)]
*  That's not that literally is not even remotely a question. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3244.38s)]
*  The fact that we have a designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terror is further, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3248.6200000000003s)]
*  further terror upon Cuba. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3254.94s)]
*  It is one of the one of the ways in which we have [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3256.7s)]
*  continues to defended this inhumane blockade implemented for the crime of having a revolution [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3260.22s)]
*  against a brutal fascist dictator, a brutal fascist dictator that happened to, you know, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3267.66s)]
*  be backed by the American government. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3272.7s)]
*  And Iran. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3275.02s)]
*  It means that humanitarian organizations, church groups and various human rights [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3275.9s)]
*  organizations can now move aid to help the people in Cuba without facing any sort of [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3280.94s)]
*  UN sanctions, US sanctions. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3286.54s)]
*  It also means that a number of political prisoners are going to be released by the [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3288.94s)]
*  Cuban government. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3293.42s)]
*  That whole operation is going to be overseen by the Catholic church. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3294.38s)]
*  I will tell you something. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3297.5s)]
*  I will tell you something more about before we move on from the Palestine stuff. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3299.58s)]
*  If this ceasefire is implemented, and I really, really hope it is, okay, you are going to see [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3306.86s)]
*  a lot more Americans recognize the full severity of Israel's cruelty in Gaza. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3313.26s)]
*  It's going to be shocking for you because you've been here this whole time. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3320.86s)]
*  So you see it. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3325.42s)]
*  You've seen it. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3326.38s)]
*  You've seen it every day. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3327.02s)]
*  So for you, you understand it. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3328.54s)]
*  But even for many of you, there will be new revelations if international human rights [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3330.94s)]
*  organizations are allowed to go in and conduct investigations to try to even tackle the full [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3335.58s)]
*  severity of Israel's violence. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3345.66s)]
*  You'll start seeing mainstream outlets report on it a little bit differently. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3348.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3352.86s)]
*  And they already have. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3353.42s)]
*  That's why you saw the MSNBC coverage with Chris Hayes, who has, you know, he's always [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3354.46s)]
*  been a better voice than the rest of, than the rest of the MSNBC anchors in general. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3361.74s)]
*  But also you saw the 60 minutes reporting on it. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3369.18s)]
*  And even the New York Times is engaging in a little bit of ass covering. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3372.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3378.06s)]
*  Death toll in Gaza likely 40% higher than reported researchers say. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3378.62s)]
*  More than 64,000 Palestinians may be killed by traumatic injury in the first nine months [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3383.02s)]
*  of the war in Gaza, according to a new study, the peer review statistical analysis led by [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3386.4599999999996s)]
*  epidemiologists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used modeling in an [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3390.46s)]
*  effort to provide an objective third party estimate of the casualties. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3393.98s)]
*  The UN has relied on the figure from the Hamas led ministry of health, which it says has [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3396.78s)]
*  been largely accurate, but the new study suggests that Hamas health ministry tally is a significant [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3400.46s)]
*  undercount. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3403.98s)]
*  The estimate in the analysis corresponds to the 2.9% of Gaza's pre-war population having [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3404.6200000000003s)]
*  been killed by traumatic injury or one in 35 inhabitants. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3408.7000000000003s)]
*  The analysis did not account for other war related casualties, such as death from malnutrition. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3412.1400000000003s)]
*  The 46,000 number coming from the Hamas health ministry is a very specific number. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3416.86s)]
*  It is most likely an undercount. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3421.1800000000003s)]
*  Previous estimates have always shown that the Palestinian health ministry, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3423.02s)]
*  okay, the Palestinian health ministry always undercounts. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3428.1400000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3431.7400000000002s)]
*  It's usually an undercount is the closest you can get to the truth, but it's usually [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3432.38s)]
*  always an undercount. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3436.46s)]
*  Now the real number of deaths are far larger than that death because you can't, you don't [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3437.5s)]
*  have access to medicine because your hospital exploded. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3444.86s)]
*  That's because deaths that lead to being in warlike conditions, deaths through famine, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3447.34s)]
*  deaths through dehydration, deaths through numerous other numerous other ways in which [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3454.38s)]
*  Israel's siege has caused deaths in the Gaza strip are not counted in this number. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3459.58s)]
*  The Hamas, the Palestinian run health ministry's numbers, 46,000 are very specific. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3464.38s)]
*  Death by Israeli bullets and Israeli rockets. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3471.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3475.82s)]
*  This does not count hypothermia, pneumonia, death by disease and the like. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3477.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3482.54s)]
*  Poisonings by contaminated food, not having access to medical equipment. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3482.94s)]
*  Those numbers are not counted in these direct numbers. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3487.02s)]
*  This is, and this London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is saying that even [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3489.42s)]
*  the deaths caused directly by gunshots and directly by Israeli bullets and directly by [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3494.54s)]
*  Israeli ammunition and munitions is still an undercount. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3501.18s)]
*  And that death number is probably around 64,000. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3506.86s)]
*  The Lancet study and its estimations, the Lancet study and its estimations are significantly [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3510.06s)]
*  higher than the Palestinian health ministry's numbers for that reason. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3518.54s)]
*  Because historically direct munition deaths, okay. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3523.5s)]
*  Traumatic injury due to war related, you know, due to Israel's direct bombing campaigns. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3528.78s)]
*  Like those are always going to be much lower than the much larger number of deaths that [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3537.5s)]
*  happen due to the war related casualties, such as deaths from malnutrition, waterborne illness, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3544.62s)]
*  or the breakdown of the health system as the conflict has progressed. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3549.34s)]
*  Yes, Lancet uses excess deaths as their metric, which gets a much better picture, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3551.98s)]
*  much like the COVID excess death number is getting us a better picture of COVID deaths. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3555.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3558.78s)]
*  I've already interviewed Bernie Sanders. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3559.5s)]
*  But let's get back to Cuba. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3561.42s)]
*  ...it includes what we're told is a significant number of people, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3562.54s)]
*  including those who were involved in the so-called food protests in 2021. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3566.7s)]
*  Now, this is also political because Joe Biden knows that when the Trump administration comes [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3571.9s)]
*  back to the White House, there are a number of Cuba hardliners there. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3577.42s)]
*  Not least Marco Rubio, a Florida senator who is earmarked to be the next Secretary of State [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3581.58s)]
*  and has spoken out many, many times about the situation in Cuba. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3587.58s)]
*  So could this be easily flipped? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3591.9s)]
*  Well, it's not completely easy to do, but certainly Donald Trump could make a number [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3593.8199999999997s)]
*  of executive orders in the first couple of days that would effectively nullify what Joe Biden has [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3598.7799999999997s)]
*  done. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3604.7799999999997s)]
*  But it's interesting that the Biden campaign and the Biden team criticized [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3605.2599999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump doing this on his way out the door. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3609.66s)]
*  And here Joe Biden has done exactly the same with just six days left in the White House. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3612.14s)]
*  And just to be clear, this doesn't have any impact on the economic embargo that's been on Cuba since [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3617.42s)]
*  the 1960s, does it? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3623.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, essentially, if you're designated a state supporter of terrorism, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3624.7799999999997s)]
*  it means that you can't get arms sales. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3629.58s)]
*  That was never going to happen. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3632.3799999999997s)]
*  It also means that some things designated as dual use could actually make its way through [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3633.8199999999997s)]
*  to Cuba without the company providing them and getting sanctions. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3638.94s)]
*  But the biggest plus, of course, is the aid. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3642.7000000000003s)]
*  That means that groups can send aid to Cuba. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3645.58s)]
*  It can help the people who are living there and make things slightly easier because we know [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3649.1s)]
*  that certainly Cuba has been struggling over the last few years. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3653.66s)]
*  Remember, it was dual use, by the way. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3657.42s)]
*  Remember dual use. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3659.66s)]
*  Americans that are even anti-Israel will often understand what that means when Israel does it [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3661.1s)]
*  to the Palestinians, but won't understand it when America does it, when we do it to Cuba. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3666.86s)]
*  It was back in the 1980s that Cuba was initially designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3672.06s)]
*  That was changed by Barack Obama in 2017, flipped again by Donald Trump, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3677.7400000000002s)]
*  flipped now by Joe Biden. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3682.94s)]
*  Watch this space about what happens in the next couple of weeks. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3684.86s)]
*  And you noted there that Biden left it to the last days of his presidency to do this. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3687.7400000000002s)]
*  Many thought that he would do it in the first few days of his presidency. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3691.9s)]
*  Do we know why there was such a time lag? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3695.18s)]
*  Well, they wanted to make sure that all the criteria for changing the designation were met. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3697.74s)]
*  Now, there's no reason why it's taken four years. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3703.3399999999997s)]
*  Certainly, as I said, Anthony Blinken in 2022 was looking and saying that they were about to change it. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3706.62s)]
*  It was possibly going to happen. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3713.1s)]
*  Why the whole process is taking quite so long, no one is. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3714.94s)]
*  But given that just a week ago, Joe Biden changed the designation of the ability of oil companies [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3718.14s)]
*  to drill offshore in America. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3724.54s)]
*  This is yet another attempt by Joe Biden, as often happens when presidents are handing over [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3726.94s)]
*  to a president of another party, essentially trying to tie him to some of the policies [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3732.46s)]
*  that are already in place and making things difficult if he wants to change things. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3737.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Good stuff. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3741.58s)]
*  Giving Cuba six full days of freedom until very quickly this designation changes back. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3743.9s)]
*  Six days, chap. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3751.34s)]
*  Like I said, you could have done this for the past four years, not even a full week. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XWvm_EYkh0&t=3752.7s)]
