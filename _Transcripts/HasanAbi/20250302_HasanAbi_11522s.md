*  Yugi's so... [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3362.34s)]
*  That's too much space. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3364.34s)]
*  Blue ball, okay. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3370.34s)]

*  Pass it, pass it. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3378.34s)]
*  Turnover first play. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3380.34s)]
*  Turnover first play. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3382.34s)]
*  He's an official ref though. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3384.34s)]
*  No, that one. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3386.34s)]
*  He's the ref. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3388.34s)]
*  Marlin going back door. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3390.34s)]
*  Why don't you just... [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3392.34s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3394.34s)]
*  I told you I was going to play. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3396.34s)]
*  They're letting them play. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3398.34s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3400.34s)]
*  Is the scoreboard good? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3402.34s)]
*  If that's not a foul, they're letting them play. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3404.34s)]
*  I told them to play like a true ball. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3406.34s)]
*  Only call crazy shit. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3408.34s)]

*  Hold on, Jason. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3416.34s)]
*  Good hustle. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3418.34s)]
*  Okay, Jason. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3420.34s)]
*  Good hustle, honestly. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3422.34s)]
*  Fixed cam. Wait, what's wrong with cam? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3424.34s)]
*  Oh, leaving Marlin? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3428.34s)]
*  Who's guarding Marlin? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3430.34s)]
*  Hasan. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3432.34s)]
*  There we go. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3434.34s)]
*  Hasan's yolk is, bro. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3436.34s)]
*  Marlin attracting the double, finding the open cutter. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3438.34s)]
*  Good basketball play, bro. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3440.34s)]
*  2-0, 2-0. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3442.34s)]
*  Hasan wants it. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3444.34s)]
*  That's too easy. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3446.34s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3448.34s)]
*  Come on, Hasan. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3450.34s)]
*  Arki's got to get the ball here. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3452.34s)]
*  Oh, uh-oh. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3454.34s)]
*  Fuck his dad. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3456.34s)]
*  Oh! [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3458.34s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3460.34s)]
*  Marlin played in college. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3462.34s)]
*  In Sweden, I think. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3464.34s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3466.34s)]
*  Come on, Yugi. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3468.34s)]
*  Come on, Yugi. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3470.34s)]
*  That's too much space. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3472.34s)]
*  Too open. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3476.34s)]
*  Good shot, good shot. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3478.34s)]
*  I don't know if dredge is going anywhere. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3480.34s)]
*  Bro, they're giving too much space. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3482.34s)]
*  I think it is kind of hard. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3484.34s)]
*  I think that's NBA 3. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3486.34s)]
*  It is NBA 3. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3488.34s)]
*  Shit. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3490.34s)]
*  There we go. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3492.34s)]
*  Good hustle, Jason. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3494.34s)]
*  Jason's everywhere. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3496.34s)]
*  Jason's a good role player, for sure. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3498.34s)]
*  Holy shit, we're tossing up bricks right now. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3502.34s)]
*  Hasan's not shy. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3504.34s)]
*  Hasan's not shy with the ball. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3510.34s)]
*  He'll put some shots up. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3512.34s)]
*  Oh, he's in the wrong head. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3514.34s)]
*  Marlin can move for a size, though. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3518.34s)]
*  He's not dumpy. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3520.34s)]
*  Marlin's good. He looks good. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3522.34s)]
*  He's from Sweden, yeah. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3524.34s)]
*  Jason. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3528.34s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3530.34s)]
*  Good hustle. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3532.34s)]
*  Good hustle. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3534.34s)]
*  Oh yeah, Jason. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3536.34s)]
*  Damn. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3538.34s)]
*  Don't touch it. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3540.34s)]
*  Oh, Draymond. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3542.34s)]
*  See him up next time. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3544.34s)]
*  Wait, so I don't know what the score is. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3546.34s)]
*  The chat. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3548.34s)]
*  It's 3-0. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3550.34s)]
*  Good D. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3552.34s)]
*  Yeah, for real. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3554.34s)]
*  Put the ball in Arki's hand. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3556.34s)]
*  They don't have anybody on offense who can score the ball. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3558.34s)]
*  That's the issue. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3560.34s)]
*  That's the problem. They're going to run into each other. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3562.34s)]
*  Hit that, Arki. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3564.34s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3566.34s)]
*  What the fuck was that? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3568.34s)]
*  We should have played them first. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3570.34s)]
*  We should have played Reggie first. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3572.34s)]
*  Keep shooting. Keep shooting. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3574.34s)]
*  Hassan. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3576.34s)]
*  That's good defense. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3578.34s)]
*  Good D. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3580.34s)]
*  Take over, Marlin. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3582.34s)]
*  So some of the games, what I'm thinking is, some of the games are probably going to be like this where it's like. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3584.34s)]
*  3-0. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3588.34s)]
*  3-0, team blue. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3590.34s)]
*  I just don't see any. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3596.34s)]
*  Shoot. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3598.34s)]
*  Bang. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3600.34s)]
*  I've been waiting for that. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3602.34s)]
*  I've been waiting. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3604.34s)]
*  That was a nice shot. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3606.34s)]
*  That was a nice shot. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3608.34s)]
*  Oh, he wants it. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3610.34s)]
*  He took it from his hands. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3612.34s)]
*  Okay, Yubi. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3614.34s)]
*  Arki and Aiso adjacent. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3618.34s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3620.34s)]
*  Damn. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3622.34s)]
*  Ron is on the floor. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3624.34s)]
*  This ain't basketball, bro. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3628.34s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to be honest. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3630.34s)]
*  The red team is out. No way. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3632.34s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3634.34s)]
*  That was good. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3636.34s)]
*  Arki, what's that? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3638.34s)]
*  Oh yeah, Arki. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3640.34s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3642.34s)]

*  Oh my god. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3652.34s)]
*  Blue team needs you too. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3654.34s)]
*  They're tossing up air balls. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3656.34s)]
*  Hey, Chad, don't worry. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3658.34s)]
*  The real Hoopers get in after this game. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3660.34s)]
*  That's when the real Hoopers start. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3662.34s)]
*  This is the Jason Nguyen game. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3664.34s)]
*  I'm surprised. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3666.34s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3668.34s)]

*  He's got to cook. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3676.34s)]
*  Oh, Hassan didn't know the cup was coming. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3678.34s)]
*  That's a good pass. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3680.34s)]
*  It's 3-2 right now. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3682.34s)]
*  We have one more. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3684.34s)]

*  Nice to meet you. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3690.34s)]
*  This is my childhood friend, Brian. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3692.34s)]
*  We know each other for a minute. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3694.34s)]

*  I just want to have the game first to set. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3712.34s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3714.34s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3716.34s)]
*  Oh my gosh, Nas. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3718.34s)]
*  Oh my... [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3720.34s)]
*  We've got to get some boards. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3722.34s)]
*  Wait, okay. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3724.34s)]
*  How is Jason's team... [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3726.34s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3728.34s)]
*  That was a nice step back. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3730.34s)]
*  How is Jason's team rebounding? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3732.34s)]
*  Good pass. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3738.34s)]
*  That's 4-2. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3740.34s)]
*  4-2. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3742.34s)]
*  I feel like Team Red is out rebounding. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3746.34s)]
*  They are and Team Blue is way tall. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3748.34s)]
*  Hassan wants it inside. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3752.34s)]
*  These teams can't... [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3756.34s)]
*  I don't know. They can't really get... [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3758.34s)]
*  Maybe you should have stayed at second. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3760.34s)]
*  That's what I said. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3762.34s)]
*  I know they won't let them. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3764.34s)]
*  I feel like... [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3766.34s)]
*  Oh, what's the score? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3768.34s)]
*  That's 4-4. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3770.34s)]
*  4-4. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3772.34s)]
*  4-4. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3774.34s)]
*  4-4. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3778.34s)]
*  It's so easy to get back into the game. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3780.34s)]
*  You can be down 6-0, hit 3-2. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3782.34s)]
*  1s and 2s. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3784.34s)]
*  That's the beauty. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3786.34s)]
*  7 is so short. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3788.34s)]
*  7, you can get like 2 or 3 lucky shots. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3790.34s)]
*  Oh, back to Nas. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3792.34s)]
*  Here's the thing I'm questioning. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3794.34s)]
*  These are all content creators. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3796.34s)]
*  Is their stamina going to run out? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3798.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3800.34s)]
*  Unless they're like LA Fitness legends like me. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3802.34s)]
*  We're LA Fitness legends? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3804.34s)]
*  I'm like a LA Fitness Debbie God. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3806.34s)]
*  I'm not good, but I just play. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3808.34s)]
*  This might be the most unorganized [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3810.34s)]
*  university of my life. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3812.34s)]

*  Ron is a great ref, bro. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3822.34s)]
*  He's checking the feed. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3824.34s)]

*  6-4. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3844.34s)]
*  No, Nas. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3846.34s)]
*  I know commentators aren't supposed to be biased, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3848.34s)]
*  but we've got to get blue team out of here. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3850.34s)]
*  You can be biased as much as you want. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3852.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I definitely had team red before this. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3854.34s)]
*  As a participant. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3856.34s)]
*  You're a ref, bro. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3858.34s)]
*  We've got to get blue team out of here. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3860.34s)]
*  It's too good. Get them out of here. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3862.34s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3864.34s)]
*  Hassan knows to play up now. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3866.34s)]
*  Yugi. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3872.34s)]

*  He's got a fat ass. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3886.34s)]
*  He does, right? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3888.34s)]
*  Hold up. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3890.34s)]

*  When our team is having [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3902.34s)]
*  team meetings, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3904.34s)]
*  Hassan looks gassed. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3906.34s)]
*  But it's low-key good because [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3908.34s)]
*  Marlin went up. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=3910.34s)]

*  My side's coming out. You got to go through Marlon. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4246.34s)]
*  Are these the worst two teams in the tournament? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4248.34s)]
*  They got to go through Marlon. That doesn't mean he has to shoot every shot, but just work through it. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4250.34s)]
*  All we need is a lawyer. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4252.34s)]

*  Son, use your body. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4256.34s)]
*  Work through Marlon. He's the best player on the court. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4258.34s)]
*  Marlon is by far the best player on the court. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4260.34s)]
*  Yeah, put the ball in his hand. Something good will happen. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4262.34s)]
*  Oh, my God. Why's he arching his... [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4266.34s)]
*  It's like Cameron Paine. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4268.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4270.34s)]

*  Team Red is gassed. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4280.34s)]
*  Oh, Jason... [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4282.34s)]
*  I can't wait to see the real teams go. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4284.34s)]
*  Bro, I wish we were playing one of them. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4286.34s)]
*  So next game is Max's team versus [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4288.34s)]
*  Cash's team. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4290.34s)]
*  That might take like an hour long. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4292.34s)]
*  That's a hack, bro. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4294.34s)]
*  Every play, foul, foul, foul. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4296.34s)]
*  Bro, two-twos, you're back in the game. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4300.34s)]
*  Yeah, Nod, you gotta hit one. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4302.34s)]
*  Nod, you gotta get one. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4304.34s)]
*  That's just bad shots. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4312.34s)]
*  That's just bad shots. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4314.34s)]
*  Oh, oh! [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4318.34s)]
*  Hell no. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4320.34s)]
*  How many air balls have we witnessed in game one? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4322.34s)]
*  We're in the double digits with the air balls. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4326.34s)]
*  Bro, we were in the double digits [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4328.34s)]
*  the first two minutes of the game. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4330.34s)]

*  Ryan, he needs a sub. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4390.34s)]
*  You need a sub? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4392.34s)]
*  Jason, you got to stay out on the court for the last possession, bro. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4394.34s)]
*  Decoy, decoy, decoy, decoy. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4396.34s)]
*  Jason, you good, bro? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4398.34s)]
*  His ankles are made of glass. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4400.34s)]
*  Damn. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4402.34s)]
*  Hey, Marlon, end this, bro. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4404.34s)]
*  He's finishing the game, bro. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4406.34s)]
*  I'm actually fucked. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4408.34s)]
*  I'm actually fucked. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4412.34s)]
*  I'm looking how far this business is going. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4414.34s)]
*  Bro, come on. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4416.34s)]
*  The line is so long. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4418.34s)]
*  Hey, you can shoot for that. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4420.34s)]
*  Alright, now I'm so in. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4422.34s)]
*  They can't get a shot to fucking last right now. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4424.34s)]
*  Literally short of time. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4426.34s)]
*  If we were on the court right now, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4428.34s)]
*  like four and four. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4430.34s)]
*  And we just need two threes to tie it up. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4432.34s)]
*  This might be the worst. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4434.34s)]
*  Max, what are your thoughts on game one? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4436.34s)]

*  Game two both suck. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4444.34s)]
*  If you're shooting from back there, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4446.34s)]
*  you might as well step back. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4448.34s)]
*  How is team Red out-rebounding Game Two? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4450.34s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4452.34s)]
*  What is this? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4454.34s)]
*  What is this? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4456.34s)]
*  Don't click on the screen. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4458.34s)]
*  Do not click off, bro. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4460.34s)]
*  Marlon, can you end this shit? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4462.34s)]
*  Yeah, because he's not going to be able to do it. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4464.34s)]
*  He's not going to be able to do it. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4466.34s)]
*  Can you end this shit? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4468.34s)]
*  Marlon, please, bro. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4470.34s)]
*  I already know how you're thinking. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4472.34s)]
*  This might have been his first game. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4474.34s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's over. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4476.34s)]
*  Oh! [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4478.34s)]

*  Oh! [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4488.34s)]
*  I was playing on her ankle. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4490.34s)]
*  I made it out of paper, bro. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4492.34s)]
*  Are you done? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4494.34s)]
*  You got it, man. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4496.34s)]
*  Fuck! [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4506.34s)]
*  Bro, I twisted the fuck out of my shit. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4508.34s)]
*  You think you're good or what? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4514.34s)]
*  Uh... [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4516.34s)]
*  Fuck! [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4518.34s)]
*  Fuck! [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4520.34s)]
*  Fuck this shit. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4522.34s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4524.34s)]
*  I heard there's going to be women here. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4526.34s)]
*  Fuck, bro. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4528.34s)]
*  Fuck! [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4530.34s)]
*  Fuck these shoes, bro. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4532.34s)]
*  Donovan Mitchell, bro, you make some weak ass shoes. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4534.34s)]
*  Yo, can you pass my water? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4536.34s)]
*  Water in my phone? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4538.34s)]
*  I think my phone should be right there. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4540.34s)]
*  Are you not going to be able to make it? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4546.34s)]
*  I can't. I just got to rest. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4548.34s)]
*  Bro, what the fuck? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4550.34s)]
*  What happened? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4552.34s)]
*  I twisted my ankle. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4554.34s)]
*  He said, yo, he said, you're doing it. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4556.34s)]
*  Arkee, you're doing it. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4558.34s)]
*  I didn't try to foul him. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4560.34s)]
*  He tripped over my foot. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4562.34s)]
*  That's our glue that holds this entire thing together. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4564.34s)]
*  Look what you did to him. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4566.34s)]
*  That's on me. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4568.34s)]
*  Fuck! [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4570.34s)]
*  I got AD ankles, bro. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4572.34s)]
*  It's not bad, bro. You did good. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4574.34s)]
*  I got AD ankles. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4576.34s)]
*  That's why I called out. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4578.34s)]
*  That's my bad, bro. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4580.34s)]
*  That's my bad. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4582.34s)]
*  Am I supposed to be sweating this much as a ref? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4584.34s)]
*  I don't think so, right? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4586.34s)]
*  Bro, I was more tired than usual. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4594.34s)]
*  I'm not saying it was bad. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4596.34s)]
*  It's the first game. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4598.34s)]
*  You guys won the last game. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4600.34s)]
*  Bro! [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4602.34s)]
*  You good, though? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4604.34s)]
*  That was so annoying, huh? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4606.34s)]
*  Well, they kept lobbing 3s. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4608.34s)]
*  They kept lobbing crazy 3s. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4610.34s)]
*  Half 4, 3s. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4612.34s)]
*  And they were banking them in. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4614.34s)]
*  There's not really much you can do at that point. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4616.34s)]
*  I wasn't really giving them too much distance, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4618.34s)]
*  but I had to close in on them even more. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4620.34s)]
*  Which is... [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4622.34s)]
*  That game lasted a little longer than I expected. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4624.34s)]
*  No, we started cooking them, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4626.34s)]
*  but then they got a little bit of a groove. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4628.34s)]
*  You can do it. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4630.34s)]
*  They're dropping 3s. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4632.34s)]
*  We go up against these winners. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4634.34s)]
*  Like immediately after? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4636.34s)]
*  No, no, no. Wait, Lacey... [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4638.34s)]
*  How did that happen? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4640.34s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4642.34s)]
*  But these are two good teams, so that's good. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4644.34s)]
*  So these are two good teams facing off [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4650.34s)]
*  against one other single elimination. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4652.34s)]
*  I'm happy with that. I'll take it. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4654.34s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's double elimination. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4656.34s)]
*  Oh, is it? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4658.34s)]
*  That's what they have in the post, right? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4660.34s)]
*  Double elim? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4664.34s)]
*  This should about to take 10 hours to finish. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4666.34s)]
*  Ah, fuck. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4670.34s)]
*  Dude. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4676.34s)]
*  I was in the paint, though. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4678.34s)]
*  Oh my God, bro. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4684.34s)]
*  Bro, I really got AD ankles, bro. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4686.34s)]
*  I need new basketball shoes. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4692.34s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4700.34s)]

*  Yo, Drew! [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4724.34s)]
*  Do we have ice? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4726.34s)]
*  Fuck, I need to throw down some ice. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4728.34s)]
*  Oh my God, bro. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4730.34s)]
*  I think it's bad. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4732.34s)]
*  I'm not even lying, chat. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4736.34s)]
*  Bro. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4738.34s)]
*  Because I injured it on an already injured ankle. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4740.34s)]
*  Jay, how you feeling, bro? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4742.34s)]

*  I might have tore it. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4762.34s)]
*  I might have dead ass tore it. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4764.34s)]
*  I tore it before. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=4766.34s)]

*  Right. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5278.34s)]
*  It's gonna feel stale if you don't. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5280.34s)]
*  Oh. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5286.34s)]

*  That, W.O.'s. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5328.34s)]
*  Wrong team. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5332.34s)]
*  Bro, everybody's just lobbing 3's. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5340.34s)]
*  Can you? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5342.34s)]
*  I mean, I'll try to warm up a little bit more. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5344.34s)]
*  I just feel like we barely warmed up our shots. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5346.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5348.34s)]

*  The game was almost over too. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5352.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5354.34s)]
*  You gotta tighten your shoes. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5356.34s)]
*  Oh, that's not a foul? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5362.34s)]
*  That's a fucking foul. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5364.34s)]
*  That's not a foul? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5366.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5422.34s)]
*  Ah. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5426.34s)]
*  Yo, Rug. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5428.34s)]
*  Where's the nurse? [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5430.34s)]
*  Right here. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5432.34s)]
*  This is where I tore my ligament while I was... [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5434.34s)]
*  So it's like the same thing over again. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5436.34s)]
*  Damn it, bro. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5438.34s)]

*  What's up? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5442.34s)]
*  Yo, Rug. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5446.34s)]
*  I might need a sub if you got me. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5448.34s)]
*  I don't have shoes or shorts. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5450.34s)]
*  What size shoes? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5452.34s)]
*  These are 9. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5454.34s)]
*  I can probably make it hurt. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5456.34s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5458.34s)]
*  I'm gonna take this one and I'll let you know after. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5460.34s)]
*  Are you guys right after this game? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5462.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5464.34s)]
*  I think it's one more, right? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5466.34s)]
*  We won. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5468.34s)]
*  Oh, Pat. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5474.34s)]
*  Wait, Hassan. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5476.34s)]
*  His friend. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5478.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Pat. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5480.34s)]
*  Is Pat coming? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5482.34s)]
*  It could be a good addition. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5486.34s)]
*  That's a good squad, bro. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5488.34s)]
*  I'll fuck around being coach again. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5490.34s)]
*  Dude, but that's so... [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5492.34s)]

*  I'm gonna try and play. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5500.34s)]
*  Bro, how I don't even get to play on my own team every time, bro. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5508.34s)]
*  This is so trash. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5512.34s)]
*  He is a cousin. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5524.34s)]
*  Bro, I don't want to be fucking hobbling in London, bro. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5526.34s)]
*  Because London is soon. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5528.34s)]
*  So if I fuck... [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5530.34s)]
*  Yo, I'm not gonna lie, if I twist it one more time, it's going. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5532.34s)]
*  All right, bro. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5534.34s)]

*  Does he know? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5538.34s)]
*  He's just hired hoopers? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5540.34s)]
*  He knows KShowtime, but KShowtime brought a friend. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5542.34s)]
*  I could just play slow. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5558.34s)]
*  But, bro, I'm gonna... [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5560.34s)]
*  Bro, knowing me, I'm gonna fucking... [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5562.34s)]

*  I'll be fucking playing hard, man. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5566.34s)]
*  All right, so it's Team Neon versus Team DDG. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5578.34s)]
*  You all right? [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5584.34s)]
*  Bro, how come we thought like we was the biggest team? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5586.34s)]
*  We're not. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5590.34s)]
*  Everybody's got some type of big players. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5592.34s)]

*  Is it? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5600.34s)]
*  After this or one more? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5602.34s)]
*  I think it's two more. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5604.34s)]
*  Drew, are we after this game? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5606.34s)]
*  I think it's one more. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5608.34s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5610.34s)]
*  I'm about to warm up, bro. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5612.34s)]
*  I'm about to warm up. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5614.34s)]
*  Mind you, mind you, I got to guard max. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5616.34s)]
*  Which means that on offense, I'm gonna be... [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5618.34s)]
*  I'm gonna be out of... [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5620.34s)]
*  I know. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5622.34s)]

*  Yeah, I have to. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5626.34s)]
*  Yeah, that might be close. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5634.34s)]
*  They got moon boots. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5636.34s)]
*  They keep going at you, Jason. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5638.34s)]
*  Like they're just gonna say like, yo, Morgan, just go against him. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5640.34s)]
*  Like 101. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5642.34s)]
*  I know, but listen. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5644.34s)]
*  Look at Abel. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5646.34s)]
*  You ever got search on him? [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5648.34s)]
*  No, no. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5650.34s)]
*  I've never had search on him. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5652.34s)]
*  My ice is here. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5654.34s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5656.34s)]
*  It's not too bad though. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5658.34s)]
*  The real meta is we gotta get those... [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5664.34s)]
*  Those like sugar snacks. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5666.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5668.34s)]
*  Get some quick energy. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5670.34s)]
*  Abel is a dangerous [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5672.34s)]
*  game still, but... [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5674.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's fine though. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5676.34s)]
*  Chad, the game hasn't started yet. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5678.34s)]
*  Not yet, not yet. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5680.34s)]
*  Wait, I'm gonna try to figure out the ad. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5688.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5690.34s)]
*  Chad, bro. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5692.34s)]
*  It's our game after this. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5694.34s)]
*  Now it's neon versus DDG and them. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5696.34s)]
*  We'll see, Chad. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5698.34s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5700.34s)]
*  I gotta lock in, bro. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5702.34s)]
*  I gotta lock in, Chad. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5704.34s)]
*  Bro, every... [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5724.34s)]
*  The thing about the meta is every team has like one influencer [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5726.34s)]
*  and then two hoopers that they brought. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5728.34s)]
*  And we literally don't. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5730.34s)]
*  We just have three. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5732.34s)]
*  We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5734.34s)]
*  I'm coping a little bit. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5736.34s)]
*  Yeah, me too, me too, me too. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5738.34s)]
*  You just send the current location. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5756.34s)]
*  I wanna know... [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5758.34s)]
*  Just put current location. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5760.34s)]
*  It's asking for a business name. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5762.34s)]
*  That's why. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5764.34s)]
*  You don't have to. Just put other... [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5766.34s)]
*  What score right now? Who's winning? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5768.34s)]
*  I'm gonna sit back down. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5774.34s)]
*  Big ass ice pack. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5776.34s)]
*  I don't even know if this works. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5780.34s)]
*  Nah, they hoop it. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5792.34s)]
*  3-2 DDG. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5796.34s)]
*  Come on. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5798.34s)]
*  Come on. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5800.34s)]

*  3-2 DDG. Come on. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5804.34s)]
*  Take your shoe off. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5814.34s)]
*  Bro, I feel like I gotta keep it tightened though. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5816.34s)]
*  It's not getting like any ankle support anyway. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5818.34s)]
*  Like their ankles are free. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5820.34s)]
*  Do you need a pain relief gel? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5822.34s)]
*  Do you need pain relief gel? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5824.34s)]
*  Yeah, a little key. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5826.34s)]
*  I would take the shoe off so you can actually get the ice more on it. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5828.34s)]
*  Wait, is there a point in icing if I'm gonna use it again? [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5834.34s)]
*  I should keep it warm, no? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5840.34s)]
*  Not fucking cold? [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5842.34s)]
*  I would ice it. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5844.34s)]
*  I'm just getting whatever the fuck I can get from this vitamin shot. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5848.34s)]
*  I was like, ahhh. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5852.34s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5854.34s)]
*  Oh my god, DDG. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5880.34s)]

*  Yeah! [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5888.34s)]
*  Thank god they didn't have Pat Betcher. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5902.34s)]
*  He checked, he checked, he checked. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5906.34s)]
*  Ice prevents swelling and secondary injuries. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5912.34s)]
*  Oh my god, DDG is cooking them. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5926.34s)]

*  Chad, shouldn't I keep walking? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5976.34s)]
*  Yeah, you feel like you're walking. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5978.34s)]
*  Can't really play the heat front. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5984.34s)]
*  Should I keep it up? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5986.34s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5988.34s)]
*  Yo, Chad. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5990.34s)]
*  What are those gummies or sometimes they have little carb things, like carb packets that runners use when they're doing? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5992.34s)]
*  It's not electrolytes, it's just like, it's specifically like a snack. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=5998.34s)]
*  But it has like a lot of sugar in it. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6004.34s)]
*  I was going to say, man, I don't know. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6006.34s)]
*  They might know. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6008.34s)]

*  Jack, can you guys explain to me how the bracket works? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6294.34s)]
*  I don't really understand it. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6296.34s)]

*  We're not done? No. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6300.34s)]
*  This is my advice, bro. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6302.34s)]
*  You have to win and lose this bracket to jump back to the team for the championship. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6304.34s)]
*  You win here, you go there. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6308.34s)]
*  It's like two separate tournaments. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6310.34s)]
*  No, you turn it, bro. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6312.34s)]
*  Lacey, now that I'm in the losers' bracket, can I still make it to the finals? [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6314.34s)]
*  Yes. You gotta win every game, though. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6316.34s)]
*  You can't lose again. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6318.34s)]
*  You gotta win like two more games now. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6320.34s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6322.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, this game's gonna be... Yeah, this game's going by. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6324.34s)]

*  Morgan. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6336.34s)]
*  Oh my God! [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6338.34s)]
*  It's not looking good. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6340.34s)]
*  I'm counting on you. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6342.34s)]
*  It's not looking good. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6344.34s)]
*  It's over, Chad. It's over. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6346.34s)]
*  Oh my God, they're targeting the weak link. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6348.34s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6350.34s)]
*  What if they target me? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6352.34s)]
*  Oh, the second... [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6354.34s)]
*  Oh, he's pushing through it. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6356.34s)]
*  It don't matter. I got K-Shultz. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6358.34s)]
*  Oh! [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6360.34s)]
*  Did he dunk? Did he just dunk that shit? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6362.34s)]
*  He dunked. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6364.34s)]
*  That was a standard dunk. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6366.34s)]
*  Wow. Just like that already. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWPVOzI0xg&t=6368.34s)]
