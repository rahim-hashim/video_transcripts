*  You want to just snack on this and bounce? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, just do that. It seems easier. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=2.0s)]

*  Really, Gyoza? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=8.0s)]
*  Mmm. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=10.0s)]
*  Chicken is fire. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=12.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=14.0s)]
*  Mmm. Mmm. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=16.0s)]

*  They ain't got no napkins here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=28.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=38.0s)]
*  Wait, what did you do? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=40.0s)]
*  No, it's just a black and white photo. Who knows, dude? It's not him. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=42.0s)]
*  It's just... Y'all being racist, dude. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=45.0s)]
*  Oh, all Japanese people look alike. Okay. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=47.0s)]

*  Okay. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=59.0s)]
*  This is not a burger. No, a Moss Burger is going to suck. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=61.0s)]
*  Don't try this, Moss. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=63.0s)]
*  Oh, you've had it? Unacceptable. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=65.0s)]
*  You've had this burger? I haven't, but I've had burgers in Japan. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=67.0s)]
*  And I know this isn't going to be good. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=69.0s)]
*  But that looks like a chicken burger. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=71.0s)]

*  We can go for a bit. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=491.0s)]
*  Baked chicken drumstick. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=493.0s)]
*  Minced chicken grilled on sear. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=495.0s)]
*  There's a pair of pants that you might need. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=497.0s)]
*  That I might need? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=499.0s)]

*  Oh, here's the karaage. That's what we're looking for. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=507.0s)]
*  This is a Korean restaurant, I think. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=511.0s)]
*  Because they serve karaage and they're making Korean versions of it, too. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=517.0s)]
*  Isn't karaage Korean? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=521.0s)]
*  No. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=523.0s)]
*  Or is it Japanese? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=525.0s)]
*  This does say Korean. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=527.0s)]
*  Yangyum. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=529.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's just the way it's prepared. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=531.0s)]
*  I mean, it might be a Korean restaurant for sure. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=533.0s)]
*  Oh, they have chicken sashimi. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=535.0s)]
*  Can I eat some raw chicken, though? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=539.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=541.0s)]
*  I did that last time I was in Japan. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=543.0s)]
*  Y'all trying to eat the raw chicken? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=545.0s)]

*  Oh, dumplings look fire. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=551.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=553.0s)]
*  I'm gonna get the pan fried. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=555.0s)]
*  Pan fried Nagoya kochi and chicken dumplings. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=557.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=563.0s)]

*  Is that where the restaurant opens? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=589.0s)]
*  Or something like that? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=591.0s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=593.0s)]
*  Do you know what part of town it's in? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=595.0s)]
*  I don't know. When is that? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=597.0s)]
*  That is not tomorrow but the next day, Thursday. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=599.0s)]
*  Alright, so we're at 2. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=601.0s)]

*  I ordered one thing. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1015.0s)]
*  Bro, this is the most [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1019.0s)]
*  unnecessarily confusing thing I've ever [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1021.0s)]
*  seen. Okay, deep fried chicken. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1023.0s)]
*  I'm going to get me and [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1025.0s)]
*  Marches hopefully. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1027.0s)]
*  Oh you ordered the Korean Yangnyeom chicken [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1029.0s)]
*  piece? Yeah. Okay. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1031.0s)]
*  I'm going to delete that and get [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1033.0s)]
*  a five piece. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1035.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1037.0s)]
*  What the hell is the... [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1041.0s)]
*  No, these are deep fried chicken [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1043.0s)]
*  is like gizzard on a sheet. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1045.0s)]
*  I highly recommend it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1047.0s)]
*  This is the other thing I wanted. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1049.0s)]
*  It's just the drumstick. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1051.0s)]
*  Fried chicken? I don't know if it's fried. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1053.0s)]
*  It's [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1055.0s)]
*  a drumstick. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1057.0s)]
*  In English it's... Wait, hold on, hold on. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1059.0s)]
*  This is so [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1063.0s)]
*  unimaginably difficult. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1065.0s)]
*  It's the breaded chicken drumstick [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1067.0s)]
*  and then some dumplings. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1069.0s)]
*  Or if you can just give me some regular chicken. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1071.0s)]
*  Bro, it's not even showing up. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1073.0s)]
*  I'm going to give you fried chicken. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1075.0s)]
*  You're in the fried chicken menu. You got to go to the other dishes. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1077.0s)]
*  No, I'm in the highly recommended [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1079.0s)]
*  ones, but here, let's look at meal. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1081.0s)]

*  That's what that is. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1361.0s)]
*  Fried chicken gizzard. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1363.0s)]
*  If I'm... [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1365.0s)]
*  Those wings don't look too appetizing. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1367.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1369.0s)]
*  If you're brave enough, do the right thing. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1371.0s)]
*  I don't know what that's for. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1381.0s)]
*  What we have here is [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1383.0s)]
*  spicy chicken wings, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1387.0s)]
*  gyoza, and then a five-piece fried chicken [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1389.0s)]
*  with radish and ponzu sauce, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1391.0s)]
*  and then a young, young yam [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1393.0s)]
*  chicken five-piece as well, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1395.0s)]
*  and then one garlic. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1397.0s)]
*  But that doesn't look like [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1399.0s)]
*  fried garlic. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1401.0s)]
*  So, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1405.0s)]
*  they didn't put our deep fried cutlets? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1407.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1409.0s)]
*  That's one. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1411.0s)]
*  I think we should settle up [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1413.0s)]
*  and get you back, Asan. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1415.0s)]
*  This is very good. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1421.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm kind of sad we can't have more. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1423.0s)]
*  It's been really good. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1425.0s)]
*  I kind of want to order more. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1427.0s)]
*  Did you just eat the leg of it? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1433.0s)]
*  Oh, I thought you had one of those. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1435.0s)]
*  Alright, I'm going to... [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1437.0s)]
*  Is that good or no? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1439.0s)]
*  These are great. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1441.0s)]
*  Dry rub? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1443.0s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1445.0s)]
*  Don't look too appetizing, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1447.0s)]
*  I won't lie, but... [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1449.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1455.0s)]

*  Very good. Looks can be deceiving. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1459.0s)]
*  Sometimes you enter a dojo and you take a photo. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1467.0s)]
*  Mmm. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1473.0s)]
*  This is [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1485.0s)]
*  so much better than I thought it was going to be. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1487.0s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1489.0s)]
*  I'm normally not a big dry rub fan, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1493.0s)]
*  but god... I think this is gizzard. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1495.0s)]

*  I didn't talk to her. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1507.0s)]
*  Maybe it's a combo? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1509.0s)]
*  It could be a situation. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1511.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpy1Hpdevmo&t=1513.0s)]
