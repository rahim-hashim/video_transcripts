*  they had the audacity to share a photo of one of the women you thought made her look like a slut. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=48.16s)]
*  You're actually an evil person with no empathy for others. And it's always guys like this who, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=52.0s)]

*  Neil game and shit. If you think reading about a guy who can't stop assaulting women in real life [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=72.72s)]
*  is smothered and that's a you problem. You are a good man. I'll pay you a hundred dollars. If [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=76.48s)]
*  you can summon the courage who is Neil Gaiman editors. No, the story contains content that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=80.8s)]
*  readers may find disturbing, including graphic allegations of assault. Last summer, British [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=86.88s)]
*  podcast broke the news that multiple women had accused Neil Gaiman, the acclaimed British [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=90.16s)]
*  fantasist and author of the sand man of sexual assault. Most of them were in their twenties [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=94.72s)]
*  when they met game. And with one exception, the stories take place when game was in his 40s or [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=99.28s)]
*  older by then he had a reputation as one of the greatest modern comic book writers and an outspoken [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=102.64s)]
*  champion of women or features writer Lila Pearl talks to more women who shared allegations of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=106.48s)]
*  assault, coercion, abuse. She also looks into Gaiman's upbringing in Scientology, as well as [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=111.68s)]
*  his relationship with his wife, Amanda Palmer, and what she knew through their story. She [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=116.16s)]
*  uncovers dark secrets Gaiman hate hit for decades. His father was kicked out of the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=119.76s)]
*  church of Scientology for sexual assault allegations. Wait, Scientology. Okay. That actually [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=124.48s)]
*  changes the dynamic a little bit. I don't know who this guy is at all, but when I hear about someone [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=130.16s)]
*  who left the Scientology church, okay. And I hear about like horrific things that they did, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=136.08s)]
*  not this guy, but his father, at least I don't know. I don't know, dude, that, that, that seems, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=142.56s)]
*  that seems a little bit suspicious. I'll be honest, not about Neil Gaiman, but his dad, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=149.84s)]
*  you really need to read books. I'll see. No, I'm good. Neil also do horrible things. You can say [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=153.52s)]
*  that about him too. Getting kicked out of Scientology for assaults, like getting kicked out of ISIS for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=158.56s)]
*  being too much. Yeah. I don't know if he actually got kicked out is what I'm saying. That could be [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=161.84s)]
*  a different story. Unless he like was a high ranking Scientology guy and he actually got [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=166.4s)]
*  kicked out. In which case that's the most insane thing I've ever heard in my life. It's a cult. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=170.8s)]
*  How do you get kicked out of a cult? That's the whole point. I thought that's literally why you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  joined cults is, and then elevate your status in cults is to literally the higher the rank you have, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=180.08s)]
*  the more sexual assaults you are able to do. So that's kind of the purpose of it. So it's weird [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  that they were just like, you're too good at this thing that we wanted you to do. Like he was just [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=194.88s)]
*  really invested, I guess. Yeah. It's like, that's insane. I've never, I've never heard of something [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=199.36s)]
*  like that, dude. I didn't blast off yet. No, that's like getting, dude, that's getting, that's like [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=204.32s)]
*  getting kicked out. I mean, I was about to say, he's getting kicked out of the Catholic church. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  Like that's why I don't do pro essay anymore. Too many sweats. Yeah. Too many sweats in the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=214.48s)]
*  Scientology. They were like, this is, you're doing competitive levels of this. We need to, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=220.16s)]
*  we need to stop you anyway. Let's blast off. Let's blast off forever yet, because it's, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  you know, I've been, I've been chirping. I've been talking, talking, talking for a while. Okay. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  It's Monday newsday. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo1o92iu2n0&t=236.56s)]
