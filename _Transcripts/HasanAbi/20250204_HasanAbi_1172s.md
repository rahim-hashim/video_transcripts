# Hasan Fits Everything In Japan | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs)
*  I actually fit into stuff in Japan and that made me go crazy mode. And I definitely need [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=0.0s)]
*  to that's an off white collab with Montclair. Wait, really? I don't think he says it anywhere. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=6.16s)]
*  It's got zippers on the side, but it doesn't say off white anywhere. I don't know if you're right. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=11.28s)]
*  Yeah. I didn't fit into anything last time I was in Japan and this time I actually do fit in the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=15.76s)]
*  shit. So I'm just going kind of crazy. I'm going crazy mode. I have to buy a second bag for sure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=20.0s)]
*  Like I'm going to need a second checked in luggage. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=25.84s)]
*  Tokyo, Nihon this Minato city. No insta story. I do. I did post the insta story. I just, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=32.96s)]
*  oh, it didn't, it didn't upload. I saw annoying. Anyway, 33 and still doesn't know what sun is. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=40.8s)]
*  Has any look very suburban right now. Love streams. Yeah. It loved the stream yesterday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=50.0s)]
*  Respectfully. Hey, are you hung over? No, I'm just, no, it's fucking 5 a.m. Man. I've been up [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=54.16s)]
*  for an hour. That's amazing. That's crazy. Yeah, dude. I'm hung over at 5 a.m. I'm insane. I drink [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=62.0s)]
*  all night and then I just start streaming. Anyway, you two were caked up. Well done yesterday. Also [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=69.84s)]
*  cool sweater. Thank you. I'm wearing basically listen, I'm in Nihon this, all right. For not [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=75.6s)]
*  for much longer, unfortunately. And it makes me very sad to think about. It makes me very sad to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=82.24s)]
*  think about because it's 5 a.m. out here. Okay. It's 5 a.m. Wednesday the 5th, but where you're at, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=89.36s)]
*  it's actually you're in Los Angeles where you're at. It's actually 12 p.m. The day prior. Okay. I [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  only got a couple more days out here. This is basically my last day, my last full day out here, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=105.28s)]
*  but there's some advantages to going back to Los Angeles. One, I get to work out. Okay. That's huge [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=111.6s)]
*  to Kaya. I miss Kaya a lot. I miss her a lot. That's my baby. Three. You get to see your favorite [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=120.56s)]
*  podcast. Go. No, that is not a benefit to it, but I guess Austin is back. Austin is back home [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  and he's writing in the chat. Austin, you missed out one of the craziest gay streams that we've [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=135.12s)]
*  ever done. We learned how to twerk yesterday. It was me and misgive. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=139.68s)]
*  It's pretty gay. Ha ha. You ain't seen gay like that. What is the word [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=142.32s)]
*  kind of gym culture in Japan? I have no option to move. I have the option to move there to work [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=172.24s)]
*  for three years, bro. You can make your own culture. Are you kidding me? As long as you don't [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=177.12s)]
*  have tattoos, you can go to most gyms with the exception of, I mean, if you do have tattoos, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=181.12s)]
*  you can go to the one-piece gym or like a Western focused gym probably. But if you have the option [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=185.68s)]
*  to live in Japan, as opposed to whatever kind of boring as fucking place you're living in right now, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  I would take it. Like the thing is for me, the only thing that's stopping me from living in Japan [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  is the reality that I have to wake up at 4am every morning. That's it. Like I, you live in LA and it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=201.68s)]
*  sucks, but not that much. No. My point is I would live here if I didn't have to wake up at 4am every [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=208.56s)]
*  morning. The time zones are crazy. You just get used to time zones. No man. I'm no. What do you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=216.08s)]
*  think I wake up at 4am in the morning because I'm, I'm not fixing my jet lag. Are you stupid? No, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=223.12s)]
*  I wake up at 4am every morning so I can stream you for you. So you can sit there and watch [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=229.92s)]
*  it's been two weeks. You literally really think that I just couldn't figure out jet lag. That's [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  crazy. Do it in the chest. Like, Oh, you'd probably acclimate did to the, you know, time zone. If you [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  live there, it's not a big problem. Oh, you think you think my body doesn't want to fucking acclimate [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  the Japanese time. There is no time slot in Japan where it makes sense to stream. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=257.6s)]
*  It's just doesn't exist. There's no time slot in Japan that makes sense for America. I would have [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  to stream, I guess like in the morning, it literally is the opposite world. It is the opposite time frame [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=268.64000000000004s)]
*  chatters. My normal time, my normal time for LA starts at 11am. Like all of my, my entire stream [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  would be late at night. It is a terrible time zone for America. Can you please go to a Japanese [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=282.24s)]
*  head spa? Wait, did people unironically think like, I just can't sleep at night. And that's why I wake [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  myself up every morning at 4am to start my stream. Like people just genuinely thought I wanted to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=294.08s)]
*  fuck my life up in Japan for two weeks. That's crazy. There's no way, right? That's just like [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=302.48s)]
*  one dude. I'm getting one guy. There's no way someone is like that. Oh Jesus Christ. Anyway, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=309.2s)]
*  classic as I'm being so mean, Hassan, I'll be self-sabotage. Yeah. Those are the chatters [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=315.68s)]
*  who understand only politics. Nah, dude, just stream it. 11am Japan time. Nice. I'm going to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=320.64s)]
*  be so sad when you leave Japan. Some of your best streams ever. Yeah. Just stream at the normal time [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=326.32s)]
*  you would stream in the U S what's the problem. Okay. I think people are trying to fuck with me [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=330.8s)]
*  and piss me off. So I yelled them anyway. Yeah. If you have a job that doesn't require you to be [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=334.8s)]
*  on at the same time internationally, then yeah, I would live out here. If I only made VODs, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=343.76s)]
*  if my job required me to make VODs, like not, not live streaming, I could live out here for sure. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=349.6s)]
*  Did you eat your expensive fruits? No, no. What is this built like the average of some fan? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=355.36s)]
*  Oh, flow key. Fucking owned a random dip shit. Look at this built like the average Hassan fan to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=360.64s)]
*  imagine coming after Floki with that. That's so funny. He's so goddamn bralic. Go to bed at [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=368.0s)]
*  8pm Japan time and wake up at 4am Japan time. No, that's literally what I've been doing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=374.08s)]
*  That's what I've been doing every night. The reason why I'm able to be more revitalized in [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  the mornings now is because we'll left. So I don't, I don't go out at all or drink late, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=384.24s)]
*  late into the night. I just have like my normal dinner at around 730 to 8pm. And I go to bed by [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=390.72s)]
*  like 10. So that's what it is. How's we'll doing very sad. I think he just keeps writing in the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=397.52s)]
*  group chat about how sad he is grand dunk territory. Will is the what old will where's Kaia Kaia is [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=404.72s)]

*  been playing grand between the time period where I press the stop streaming button and press the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  start streaming button. I didn't even actually get into the personal news stuff, but after I [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  ended the broadcast at the fruit cafe and we said bye bye to coho Shibuya. Okay. Myself, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=427.68s)]

*  very warm. That's why I got it because I was cold as I got like a bunch of, I got a bunch of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=506.16s)]
*  turtle. Yeah. Hold on. My coffee's here. One second. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=512.56s)]
*  I've just been thrifting a lot out here. Have you been to Shimokita Zawa for thrift shopping? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=523.68s)]
*  No, I haven't. I love the sweater. My Jiba saying a knit Montclair is thrifty kills me. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=543.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. When you get it for a hundred dollars, it's fucking thrift. What do you want me to say? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=548.16s)]
*  It's secondhand. Yeah. I'm wearing a secondhand sweater. That's probably a thousand dollars or [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=554.72s)]
*  whatever. I don't know. I've never, I don't know this brand at all, but I got it for a hundred [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=561.52s)]
*  dollars from a secondhand store. That's a great deal on a Montclair knit W color me shock. Yeah, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=565.6s)]
*  bro. Japan is insane. And it's funny because it's like, it's funny because this was apparently [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=573.12s)]
*  something wake wanted, but it was his first day initially and he didn't understand the conversion [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=578.32s)]
*  rate. So he showed it to me. Secondhand is huge here because of recycling laws. Yeah. Yeah. And [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=583.2s)]
*  then he showed it to me and I immediately copped it. I know you said this, whatever. But I was [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=588.24s)]
*  doing something. I couldn't write it down. Could you please repeat it? No, you need to take wake [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=592.24s)]
*  shopping. Yeah. Wake love shopping by the way. Like he is actually a shopper. He was a model. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=601.52s)]
*  So he knows his brands and shit. It's kind of crazy. I made miss shop a little bit too, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  but he didn't really fuck with it at all. I tried to get him to buy a, I tried to get him to buy a [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=612.88s)]
*  jacket. Hold on one second. I tried to get him to buy a bunch of different jackets and he just [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  wouldn't do it. Secondhand store for your size. You sure they didn't make one by two, two big by [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=622.64s)]
*  mistake? No, that's the other thing. I bought a bunch of stuff and I need to get for the first [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=628.08s)]
*  time ever in all of my, in all of my years of being alive for the first time ever. I actually fit into [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  stuff in Japan and that made me go crazy mode. And I definitely need to, that's an off white collab [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=640.4000000000001s)]
*  with Montclair. Wait, really? I don't think it says it anywhere. It's got zippers on the side, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  but it doesn't say off white anywhere. I don't know if you're right. Yeah. I didn't fit into anything [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=652.48s)]
*  last time I was in Japan and this time I actually do fit in the shit. So I'm just going kind of [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=656.88s)]
*  crazy. I'm going crazy mode. I have to buy a second bag for sure. Like I'm going to need a second [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=661.04s)]
*  checked in luggage is defo off white. No, not the color of it. The color is obviously off white, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=666.56s)]
*  but that person is saying this is an off white collab with Montclair. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=674.4s)]
*  And I don't think that's the case. I, it doesn't say any off white is both a brand and also a color. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=678.88s)]
*  Anyway, I need to get a second suitcase. I've never had that happen before probably cheaper [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=685.04s)]
*  to ship it with a courier. I mean, it's free. If I check it in, it comes with the ticket. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=689.52s)]
*  Montclair turtle legs are like 800 to a thousand. So like a hundred is like a huge deal. Just by the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=694.88s)]
*  way. Yes. Everything I got was like, I got a bunch of different shit. I got a bunch of different shit. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=699.5999999999999s)]
*  And it was like, I got an orally, which is another great brand. I got like an orally sweater. That [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=705.52s)]
*  one was even cheaper. That one was like 70 bucks. And I got like another one for 30. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=712.88s)]
*  I don't even know what this brand is or Lee, like our receipts on the sweater, Montclair, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=720.0s)]
*  off white rib, turtleneck. I don't think this is it. Like look at the neck and look at the arms. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=726.8s)]
*  Yeah. This one doesn't even have zippers on the side chatter. Mine does. Yeah. This dog, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=734.4s)]
*  this has a pocket. It's an entirely different sweater chatter. I don't have no pocket. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=740.96s)]
*  This is Montclair on her. The neckline is completely different. Anyway, why are we [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=748.32s)]
*  talking about your sweater? Cause I went and I bought a bunch of shit, including this sweater [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=754.88s)]
*  and chatters love being chatters. Just love doing fashion chatters. Love two things, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=760.24s)]
*  pocket watching and fashion. So when I talk about thrifting, this is the intersection. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=765.6s)]
*  This is the intersection of pocket watching and fashion where half of the chatter will tell us [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=770.64s)]
*  about how poor they are and how virtuous that is. And the other half will say how rich I am and how [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=775.68s)]
*  dangerous that is. Okay. And then there's obviously some chatters or like, bro, I just give me the ID, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=781.92s)]
*  bro. Give me the ID. ID ID ID ID. I'm trying to cop ID ID ID ID. Yo ID on the sweater king, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=788.48s)]
*  ID on the sweater king ID on the sweater king. Should I move to Japan ID on the sweater king? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=796.48s)]
*  Yo ID ID. I'm trying to cop. I'm finna cop. I'm trying to cop anyway, which was just want the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=800.88s)]
*  politics in our waiting patiently. The freaking nerds, dude, the lame ass nerds, you got the 60 [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=806.32s)]
*  psychology fit on. Thank you. But yeah, we got gay as hell yesterday and I hope you guys enjoyed it. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=811.2s)]
*  I know Auntie Piker did. Holy moly. It's like, I've never done a stream that was just like, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=817.12s)]
*  yo, what the fuck, bro? I just clicked on, I just clicked on Twitter. And the first thing I see [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=824.24s)]
*  is just something insane. The nuke is ruining my relationship. My boyfriend defenses on, I thought [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=830.8s)]
*  I could ignore it. I don't want to control what he consumes and just told them to not watch this on [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=835.44s)]
*  in front of me. And he agreed now with all this new information about, I can't ignore it anymore. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=838.64s)]
*  I can't even look at my boyfriend. I really don't want to start a fight, but I can't say [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=843.04s)]
*  anything anymore. How do I go about approaching him on this? I know it's going to be a big fight. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=846.72s)]
*  This got to be fake, right? Like that's so sad, man. What the hell? Nah, there's no way. There's [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=850.9599999999999s)]
*  no way that's real. Wait, what? What you should respond, dude, that's crazy. I don't want, I mean, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=856.8s)]
*  what that shit just busted my brain a little bit. It broke my brain a little bit. Like how it was [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  fake. There was another post in your subreddit saying out something. All right. Anyway, sorry [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  to bring it up, but there's a matching hat too. Oh wait, what? That's funny. Yeah. This is chatter. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=875.36s)]
*  I don't think this is still the same sweater. This is a little bit closer, but it's still not [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=884.8000000000001s)]
*  the same sweater chatters are learning the minutia that everything is in the details when it comes to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=890.96s)]
*  fashion. Okay. Everything. This is again, an entirely separate sweater. Now, first of all, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=900.32s)]
*  I think one of the biggest problems that you were having is that you're looking at women's Montclair [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=907.9200000000001s)]
*  and I think this is men's because I'm going to be honest with you. I don't think they make women [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=913.44s)]
*  sizes this large, especially in Japan. I don't even know how I found a sweater that is big on me. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=920.24s)]
*  Chatter is like bad AI learning. Yeah. But it is pretty funny. Like look, you're getting closer, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=925.6s)]
*  at least like you got the arm correct this time, but notice how this is indented. Like they brought [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=935.44s)]
*  it in, in the midriff. It's a women's sweater and they probably wanted to make it not as chunky. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=942.48s)]
*  And they wanted to showcase, like they wanted to accentuate the features of the wearer. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=950.8s)]
*  So they brought the middle part in to create a different silhouette because these are very chunky [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  sweaters normally. Okay. And the cuffs are different as well. If you notice mine are like [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=962.88s)]
*  pretty straightforward. There's just a little patch. And I also have here, this is probably [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=969.1999999999999s)]
*  the most noticeable part of the sweater, which I didn't really fuck with that much, but I don't [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=974.0799999999999s)]
*  really care. It has like arm patches like this and it has zippers on the side. Okay. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=977.44s)]
*  Which I don't like, I don't like zippers at all, but like I said, it was very cheap. So I was like, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  and I was very cold. So I was like, I'm buying this shit. Like this is, this is my wills Gucci [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=988.8800000000001s)]
*  Patagonia Patagucci jacket. This is my moment for that. I'm why you dress like the owner of a racist [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  purebred dog. What a racist purebred dog. Like what? Like a dog that barks at black people. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=999.92s)]
*  Is that what you mean? Still don't my first day cop that trench coat was crazy. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1007.36s)]
*  My first day trench coat purchase was insane. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1013.5999999999999s)]
*  And I still ride that. I got some Yoji too. That was also again, something that I fit into it. Just, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1018.8s)]
*  I don't know. It's just, it probably doesn't mean much to everybody else. You're like, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1027.68s)]
*  why am I listening to a rich guy? Get to the fucking news news, man. Why am I listening to [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1030.96s)]
*  a rich guy going on a super expensive vacation and you know, purchase all these expensive clothes. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1034.56s)]
*  I hate this guy. He's such a fake socialist. And if that's your attitude about it, you're probably [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1040.48s)]
*  right. I mean, but this is also quite literally what I do every day, which is talk to you about [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1045.68s)]
*  my personal experiences. And obviously I love fashion and I love fitness and being able to come [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1050.88s)]
*  back here and being able to fit into clothes was like kind of crazy. Honestly, what happened to the [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1057.7600000000002s)]
*  pants? I got cream pie to Twitch con that's so that was what I was on the hunt for. Those are [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1063.5200000000002s)]
*  archive Yoji, I'm a motor pants, a poor home, poor home, Yoji, I want to pants from like a long [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1068.16s)]
*  ass time ago. I actually literally found a similar version of them. I got them dry cleaned. I wore [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1074.48s)]
*  them in Japan. I brought them here and oh my God, Jeter found my, my racist dog after two weeks. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1080.88s)]
*  How much did Japan run you up? I don't know a lot, but I'm also in a relatively expensive. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1088.96s)]
*  You lost weight in Japan. No, I didn't lose weight in Japan. I definitely gained weight. China is not [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1096.56s)]
*  a communist country. The people do not own the means of production and the government deliberately [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1102.48s)]
*  suppresses the wages of its workers. True King. True. I think China is a, is a higher functioning [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1105.6s)]
*  social democracy, which you can consider to be a transitional socialist state, especially considering [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1111.44s)]
*  that there is a, a tremendous amount of, I mean, the land ownership is the, is the major difference, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1116.08s)]
*  I think. But yeah, China doesn't say that they're communist anyway, but you're, you're not wrong. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1122.32s)]
*  That's how I treat China. I treat China as a, a social democracy, but with a lot of [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1128.48s)]
*  socialist values in terms of, in terms of land ownership and that's it, which is a major hurdle [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1136.4s)]
*  to overcome. So in terms of like, in terms of Norway, I would say that they're closer to a [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1143.68s)]
*  transitional socialist state than Norway is if social democracy is on the, on that spectrum. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1150.16s)]
*  Which it technically isn't. Social democracy is not on the anti-capitalist [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1157.8400000000001s)]
*  spectrum, even though there are higher degrees of socialization. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07xzowUMGcs&t=1162.3200000000002s)]
