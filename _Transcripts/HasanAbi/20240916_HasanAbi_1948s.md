**HasanAbi:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg)
*  Being from Canada, I can probably relate to what that means a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=0.0s)]
*  Crypto entrepreneur based Montreal here. So it's you know, it's we're done. We're done. We're done [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Deport deport deport deport deport deport deport deport deport deport deport deport [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=9.88s)]

*  Deport them yesterday deport them tomorrow. We have a real problem [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=19.02s)]
*  We need to shut down [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=24.6s)]
*  From Canada until we figure out what's going on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=26.92s)]
*  Just checking that we're unmuted again and we're good to go. Good evening everyone before we begin [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=37.28s)]
*  I want to address yesterday's awful events [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=41.64s)]
*  It is a huge relief to us all that nobody was hurt and I think that many in the crypto community will agree with me [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  When I say that we're here what? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  During these trying times your unwavering support for our community has gone knock on her notice and we're immensely grateful for it [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=51.48s)]
*  And really the fact that after all of this you've chosen to proceed with this interview blows my mind [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=57.4s)]
*  It speaks volume. Mr. President and thank you for being here tonight, bro. This is worse than aid and Roz. How is this possible? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=64.16s)]
*  but it worked out well in Secret Service did an excellent job and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=71.8s)]
*  they have the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=76.52s)]
*  Man behind bars and hopefully he's gonna be there for a long time dangerous person very very dangerous person [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=78.36s)]
*  But I appreciate the comments very much [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, I appreciate you for for allowing me to interview you and in your wonderful Mar-a-Lago [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=86.72s)]
*  Home, which is truly an honor and I'm very grateful for it. Thank you very much. Thank you [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=93.36s)]
*  So mr. President, I can say that myself like I was saying the crypto comedian [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=97.96s)]
*  You know millions of Americans are relieved that you're here with us today after the second attempt [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=102.58s)]
*  On your life at the Trump National Golf Club. It's just horrifying. Can you run us through what happened? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=108.36s)]
*  so I was playing golf with some of my friends who was on a Sunday morning and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  very peaceful very beautiful weather everything was beautiful nice place to be and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=120.6s)]
*  all of a sudden we heard being fired in the air and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=126.28s)]
*  I guess probably four or five and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=129.76s)]
*  It sounded like bullets. But what do I know about that? But Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=132.4s)]
*  they grabbed me and I think probably the other ones Steve is one of the people Steve would cover great friend of mine a great [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=137.96s)]
*  great businessman from mostly New York and Florida great businessman and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=146.0s)]
*  more importantly, I just a fantastic person so we're in the group and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=151.28s)]
*  Everybody just we got into the carts and we moved along pretty pretty good [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=156.36s)]
*  I was with an agent and the agent did a fantastic job. There was no question that we were off that course [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=160.28s)]
*  I would have loved to have sank that last putt but we decided let's get out of here and what the was actually [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=166.36s)]
*  interestingly was a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=174.8s)]
*  Secret Service agent had seen a barrel of a AK 47, which is a very powerful rifle and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=177.0s)]
*  He started shooting at the barrel started shooting in the bushes [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  Well could only see the barrel how good is that right could only see the barrel based on that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  he started shooting and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=194.56s)]
*  ran toward the target and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=196.6s)]
*  Was shooting a lot of them in those with it. We heard the other one never got off and he ran across the street and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=199.16s)]
*  Grabbed his car hopped into his truck or car and amazingly a civilian in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=207.16s)]
*  that area saw something and it looked very suspicious and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=213.6s)]
*  In the car drove their car to the back of his [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=217.32s)]
*  truck of some kind and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=221.04s)]
*  Took pictures of the license plate gave them [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=224.12s)]
*  To the sheriff's office [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=227.96s)]
*  Sheriff Brad shows fantastic great great sheriff for a long time and within a fairly short period of time [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=229.72s)]
*  They tracked maybe you'll call me a Trump stand for this [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=235.92s)]
*  But I really wish I could see him when we're doing these interviews [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=238.48s)]
*  Well, you wouldn't want to have somebody like that out there, you know, he dropped his the AK 47 he left his [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=241.84s)]
*  A [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=247.84s)]
*  Cameras behind left a lot of things behind. I had the civilian did I got a job a woman? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean who would think you could take a thousand times like that? How many people would have the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=254.26000000000002s)]
*  brain power to follow him and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=261.08s)]
*  Manages of the back of his truck so that they end up getting and the key was the license [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=264.56s)]
*  So they got the license and after they had the license, you know [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=269.24s)]
*  There's all sorts of technology where they can literally pinpoint where this truck is I never knew something like that existed and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  They pinpointed him on the highway [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=280.72s)]
*  They got him with a high-speed chase. So they got him [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=283.48s)]
*  It was amazing. So Secret Service did a great job and I think I can say honestly the sheriff's office [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  Law enforcement everybody really did a great job about that. That's incredible here [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=293.72s)]
*  And back up question to that second fold this you know, this was the second attempt in your life in under two months [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=298.58s)]
*  What do you make of that? Well, there's a lot of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=306.42s)]
*  Rhetoric a lot of people think that the Democrats when they talk about threat to democracy and all of this [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=309.02s)]
*  And it seems that both of these people were radical lefts [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  the first one [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=320.02s)]
*  They should learn more about they have [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=321.54s)]
*  Apps that they haven't opened yet, which is pretty strange [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=324.62s)]
*  and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=328.54s)]
*  The father went out and got the biggest lawyer in the state of Pennsylvania, which is pretty strange about the father of the shooter [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=329.78s)]
*  We're talking about in Butler the first one and that's pretty strange. There are a couple of pretty strange things going on there [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=336.3s)]
*  I can say this the Secret Service was very brave in the sense that bullets were flying and they when I went down [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=342.04s)]
*  I purposely went down. I saw what was happening and people are probably screaming [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=350.38s)]
*  If I recognize that but I went down and Secret Service they were right there with bullets flying right Adam and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=355.3s)]
*  they weren't hit but [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=362.82s)]
*  three other people were Corey fire what two other gentlemen that who they thought died and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=364.66s)]
*  Actually the roads are real butler were unbelievable. They saved their lives and we've actually raised a lot of money for the families and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=370.5s)]
*  Family of Corey and the two gentlemen always have both of the shooters were radical left [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=379.02s)]
*  They thought they were dead. I the first thing I asked came up [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=383.38s)]
*  I said how many people are dead because we had a massive crowd and with all those bullets flying so three got hit [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=385.94s)]
*  But there was a great display of brave of bravery. I mean it was incredible [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=392.41999999999996s)]
*  dude [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=398.7s)]
*  Doing your first ever like interview after being or not being but like a second assassination attempt [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=400.29999999999995s)]
*  with like a [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=407.5s)]
*  prepubescent [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=410.38s)]
*  Crypto teenager [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=411.82s)]
*  To launch your new crypto scheme is [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=416.18s)]
*  unimaginable levels of pathetic I [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=422.06s)]
*  previously thought were impossible to achieve by a former president [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=425.18s)]
*  Nobody ran in fact, they're standing up. Some of them are standing up looking for the shooter [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=431.1s)]
*  The other one has to get credit the local law enforcement [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=435.74s)]
*  The gentleman that shimmied up to the roof look saw the man with him probably made him go faster than he would normally go [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=439.78s)]
*  And so he didn't exactly hit the target the way he wanted [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=445.74s)]
*  There's something going on. I mean perhaps it's God wanting me to be president to save this country [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=450.42s)]
*  Nobody knows but when I made the right turn it's very unusual because the people weren't on the right the people were standing out in [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=456.9s)]
*  front of me when I turned my head at an exact 90 degree angle the bullet came zooming by and and clipped my ear and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=462.66s)]
*  The reason so much blood they they told me at the hospital said why so much [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=471.22s)]
*  The ear is the bloodiest part of the body because of cartilage. He was giving me all description [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=475.70000000000005s)]
*  I said, you don't have to tell me but it was a mess but [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=481.1s)]
*  amazing bravery shown [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=484.98s)]
*  Amazing talent like the doctors saving the two I two men that were hit they were hit really badly one [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=487.5s)]
*  I won't tell you exactly what happened if they were hit badly and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=492.66s)]
*  they both lived Corey didn't make it Corey was in bad shape we had a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=496.02000000000004s)]
*  Person from the National Guard about ten seats over from Corey [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=501.1s)]
*  Run to his aid and with all of he was hitting ahead with all of that was giving a mouth-to-mouth [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=505.06s)]
*  Resuscitation because he was still alive. Wow, and people couldn't believe it. They thought it was such an incredible act who would do it [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=512.3s)]
*  it would you know, just an amazing thing and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=518.46s)]
*  We're gonna take care of him too because it just I mean just the fact that he could do it and some other people [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=521.0600000000001s)]
*  so it was a [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=526.86s)]
*  It was amazing bravery and there was a mistake made a bad mistake that one building was [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=528.42s)]
*  Unmanned and tough very and that was a mistake is nothing you can say about it [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  But it was that was some that was some crazy day and then [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=539.78s)]
*  Yesterday you had another one with a different result [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=545.18s)]
*  actually much better result because [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=549.06s)]
*  We lost Corey and two gentlemen were very badly hurt [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=551.42s)]
*  But they're they're in pretty good shape now a lot of talent those local doctors up there had very tremendous talent [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=554.3s)]
*  Love to hear that. Well, this is more of a personal question. Yeah, just turned 30 last last week [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=560.3s)]
*  We were just chatting outside the room here young entrepreneur son [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=565.7s)]
*  spiring father one day [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=570.9000000000001s)]

*  I send her one each every Christmas one each every every birthday and same for my little zoomer brother [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1170.08s)]
*  Who probably isn't a baron's, you know age category? So has has learning about crypto from your children [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1176.36s)]
*  Had an impact on you. Well, it makes it easier and it's sort of like a language, you know, I have a [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1183.04s)]
*  beautiful granddaughter [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1190.32s)]
*  Ivanka's daughter and [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1192.9199999999998s)]
*  She is Arabela. She speaks perfect Chinese [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1195.6399999999999s)]
*  And [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1199.28s)]
*  There are other two children two great young boys. They spoke they speak perfect Chinese [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  They learned it when I went to a great for from a nanny who is Chinese [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1206.04s)]
*  That's impressive and she was from China and she would teach Arabela [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1210.24s)]
*  When President Xi was here [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1215.76s)]
*  President she couldn't believe it [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1218.1999999999998s)]
*  Perfect conversation and so how did she do? He said as good as any ten-year-old girl in Beijing [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1220.6399999999999s)]
*  I remember that statement. She speaks it perfectly. We just learned something. Oh my god. We just learned something [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1227.28s)]
*  Incredible about Donald China Japan or any language [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1233.36s)]
*  It's not that easy to do. How is a child? It's almost like a natural [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1237.16s)]
*  So it's a little bit like that. I think with crypto and I think group does a lot easier [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1242.6399999999999s)]
*  but there is a learning curve and [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1247.62s)]
*  Yeah, my kids my kids really understood it and they understood it pretty much right at the beginning [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1251.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were chatting with Eric in the back and I love hearing this prepubescent 30 year olds mouth noises [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1256.72s)]
*  We're about to hear all about you know, your son's, you know crypto endeavors and how much they know about it [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1262.64s)]
*  I can't believe this just gave us [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1268.04s)]
*  Unearthed lore dump from Donald Trump over there at the moment [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1270.32s)]
*  tuning life to listen to us live on spaces for token 2049 [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1275.56s)]
*  What's impressive in the East is that crypto is not the future is the present [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1279.92s)]
*  Whereas when I come here and sim in Canada and north it feels like I'm being taken aback [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1284.2s)]
*  so the question I have for you following up on what I was asking earlier is [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1289.16s)]
*  Why is it so important for America to lead in cryptocurrency adoption and innovation? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1293.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, it's crypto. It's AI. It's so many other things, you know AI speaking of [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1299.44s)]
*  an interesting future it needs [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1306.0s)]
*  tremendous [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1309.92s)]
*  Electricity capability beyond anything I've ever heard it never made sense to me [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1311.28s)]
*  But this is what it needs if you take all of the electricity [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1315.64s)]
*  In order to have to be dominant in AI you need twice that amount just for this one thing [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1319.52s)]
*  Who would think that you need twice the electricity we already have and you got to get started [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1325.0s)]
*  I mean you have to be if you're the US you have to get so right [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1330.76s)]
*  you don't want to be left in the dust and [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1334.18s)]
*  China's already building electric plants and they want to build them for you know for the AI [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1336.26s)]
*  And it's very important [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1343.1000000000001s)]
*  But you need tremendous electric and in this cut in this country because of our strong environmental impact statement [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1344.5800000000002s)]
*  Problems that we have, you know China doesn't have those problems. They don't do them. They just build they said build over [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1351.18s)]
*  They build over there with us. You have to go through years [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1356.24s)]
*  But I'll make it possible to create tremendous amounts of electricity very rapidly [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1358.7s)]
*  But people don't know that people don't know that you need double the electricity of what we already have [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1363.98s)]
*  so you want to get in whether it's crypto or AI or other things that are coming along and [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1369.02s)]
*  It's part of the game. We want to have a great country want to want to stay at the top [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1374.5s)]
*  We're we're making things now [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1379.78s)]
*  We're starting and it started under my administration that there was no chance of ever even getting involved in for a long time [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1381.66s)]
*  We're leading the pack in so many ways one of the things I'm very proud of the Space Force [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1388.1000000000001s)]
*  We were getting lapped in space by [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1392.74s)]
*  China and by Russia and now we'll we are the leader in space [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1395.86s)]
*  Also to VC that have invested in the space heavily with very little regulatory clarity [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1400.98s)]
*  But he is doing an amazing job with respect to space when you look up [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1407.34s)]
*  I think somebody said he sends 90% of the rocket sent up throughout the world or his [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1411.18s)]
*  Oh, and you got to hand it to me something. He definitely is wish he was here, but at least we're using his [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1416.1s)]
*  We'll get him. We'll get him. We're definitely using his platform to do so and I'm sure there's a reason for that [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1422.54s)]
*  So to create this future we're talking about right like there's a lot of you know, American [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1427.18s)]
*  Entrepreneurs founders in crypto that need to sadly leave the country because it feels like at times [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1433.06s)]
*  We're being treated like we're not really welcome to build companies here. The CEO of our company over at rug radio was actually debanked [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1438.8999999999999s)]
*  Earlier last year, but we'll get into that [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1445.58s)]
*  later [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1447.82s)]
*  Do you think it's important for America to have a legal framework for crypto so that businesses can thrive and survive here [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1449.1s)]
*  I do and they should have certain safeguards to you know [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1456.3799999999999s)]
*  Maybe somebody would say that's a bad thing to say but no, you know, it can't be totally freewheeling and [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1460.8999999999999s)]
*  They want I spoke to some of the big crypto people. They want safeguards. They want certain safeguards, but it's [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1467.54s)]
*  Yeah, you know who else wanted that? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1473.2199999999998s)]
*  Sbf [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1475.46s)]
*  And [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1477.66s)]
*  really going after people and [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1479.06s)]
*  I think frankly since they heard I was involved they've treated people much better [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1482.18s)]
*  Maybe they viewed his votes. Maybe they viewed his votes but people that were under serious [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1488.02s)]
*  Investigation for having done nothing wrong [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1494.14s)]
*  Are all of a sudden [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1497.38s)]
*  Allowed to go free and I really believe that's because they see, you know, this is a very big market [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1499.42s)]
*  There's a very powerful area. So, um, I'm glad I helped if I helped [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1504.7s)]
*  I don't know maybe I didn't but the SEC has been unbelievably hostile. The one thing, you know, is that [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1508.7s)]
*  if for some reason [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1514.42s)]
*  Bad bad things happen and we don't win the election [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1516.14s)]
*  those people that were under investigation and that are free as a bird right now and [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1520.5s)]
*  People that weren't being looked at in the crypto world [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1525.7800000000002s)]
*  They will be living in hell because it'll start the day after the election if they win and I view it differently [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1529.38s)]
*  I mean, I just view it that we have to be the top no matter what we do [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1536.46s)]
*  Chips or anything else was starting. We were really starting to go with the chips [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1539.98s)]
*  We have to we have to be number one and I think AI is really important [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1545.18s)]
*  But I think cryptos I think crypto is one of those one of those things we have to do whether we like it or not [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1549.38s)]
*  I have to do it. I [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1555.0200000000002s)]
*  It's really really cool to hear from you in person [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1557.9s)]
*  we've only heard it on TV and newspaper etc, but it feels good to know that a [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1560.7s)]
*  Presidential candidate and someone who was already president of United States of America feel this way about cryptocurrency [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1565.46s)]
*  I'm sure myself and a lot of people in the industry are [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1570.7s)]
*  Relieved to hear that and I will see what the results are in November. But on something a little lighter now [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1572.98s)]
*  I remember the day your NFT collections came out. That was super cool [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1578.42s)]
*  So we were I host a morning show called FOMO hour with my friend OSF and Mando and our Tyler and so we were live [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1583.3799999999999s)]
*  On air when the link dropped and so it was a very very first collection [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1588.9399999999998s)]
*  There was a chance to have dinner with you and I remember just like [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1592.6999999999998s)]
*  Scrambling to buy them. We're staying like we stopped the show live on air to thousands of people like no [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1596.98s)]
*  We gotta buy these we're gonna buy these look I gotta spend 25k on this. Let's go, right? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1601.22s)]
*  Let's do it [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1604.3799999999999s)]
*  Which is another cool thing about people in crypto, right? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1604.82s)]
*  Or there's crypto bros they call and so we're trying to buy these thing and it was just so [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1607.26s)]
*  Electric and crazy that we actually failed but hey, I guess that's a good thing because the collection [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1612.58s)]
*  You know ended up selling out and then you ended up doing it [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1616.82s)]
*  I mean you ended up doing that three times over [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1619.34s)]
*  Can you tell us more about the success that you have had with NFTs? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1622.22s)]
*  But also like did that surprise you well, I got in bro launch me into the Sun dog. I'm done [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1625.42s)]
*  I mean to be honest, I think I'm retiring you guys all my haters one. I think I'm retiring from political commentary [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1631.7s)]
*  But this might be the absolute dumbest thing that I've ever actually covered [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1639.0600000000002s)]
*  I've never I never in my life [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1646.8200000000002s)]
*  Would have thought that we'd be sitting here with a dude who did not hit puberty was [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1651.7s)]
*  Launching a crypto rug pull ad for the former president of the United States of America like [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1658.8200000000002s)]

*  You were running the planet and now you are doing crypto rug pulls [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1671.06s)]
*  Like it's it's like barely 24 hours after he almost got assassinated again [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1680.82s)]
*  Every big pride to start off. Oh my god [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1687.14s)]
*  American politics every time I think [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1699.22s)]
*  Every time I think like it can't devolve further like we can't we can't reach a new low. I'm wrong [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1702.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm reminded of how wrong I am [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1709.66s)]
*  I'm so goddamn wrong, dude. I'm the most wrong [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1712.8200000000002s)]
*  What more can happen? Let's let's fantasize Donald Trump does an interview with Andrew Tate [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfoXq3105Xg&t=1717.3s)]
