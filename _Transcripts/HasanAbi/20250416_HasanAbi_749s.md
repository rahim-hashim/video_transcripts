*  I've never seen that much love from any community. You know what I mean? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=22.52s)]
*  There's always gonna be at least a 20 to 30 percent there. They say not that guy [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=26.56s)]
*  Shockingly enough. They only got like 9% so [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=31.12s)]

*  And then I yeah when I was working out this morning, I chopped off a little chunk of my pinky [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=36.88s)]
*  So that's what happened. I was I was doing front rack. I [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=42.879999999999995s)]

*  55 pounder walking lunges. Okay, first I start off with squats [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=53.900000000000006s)]
*  Where I hit 310 for? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  6 well, I hit 310 for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=63.38s)]
*  5 here it is and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=66.54s)]
*  then I [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=69.78s)]
*  What else did I do? I did RDL's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  Romanian deadlifts with 85 pounders for 15 then 12 then 10 then 8 and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=74.9s)]
*  Then while I was you know, and then last but not least I was just honey that knocks off the camera here, but [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=81.61999999999999s)]
*  After that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=90.97999999999999s)]
*  What was doing front racked front rack lunges while I was doing front rack front rack lunges 55 pounders [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=92.3s)]
*  on the way back I'm putting the I'm putting the weights back on the rack and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=100.1s)]
*  My pinky finger got caught [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=105.82s)]
*  In between the the metal barrier that is supposed to hold the weights and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=108.86000000000001s)]
*  It just like chopped it perfectly clean. It wasn't that big of a deal. It just started bleeding a lot [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  But as you can see from the cut [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=121.7s)]
*  It was like a perfectly clean cut so no skin flew off or anything like that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=125.18s)]
*  So I was not even gonna do anything about it [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=130.62s)]
*  I just like doused it with hydrogen peroxide and then after that I doused with hydrogen peroxide immediately [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=133.94s)]
*  And then I wrapped it up like tight so it stops bleeding [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=140.82s)]
*  Did it hurt? No, it didn't even hurt [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=145.02s)]
*  I was I think I was a little shocked at how how badly it chopped it off a little bit, but [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=147.1s)]
*  Anyway, I did that and my dad freaked out [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=155.22s)]
*  That looks deep maybe glue it yeah, it is deep and that's what we did we we glued it so [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=159.56s)]
*  My dad was freaking out about it. So I I was like, alright, I'll go to urgent care. It's fine. It's not a big deal [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=164.8s)]
*  It's fine, but [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=171.52s)]
*  Bro, you realize that increases scarring to hydrogen peroxide cover, right? It's outdated bad medical care [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=174.72s)]
*  People thought it was helpful 50 years ago. Wait, what it's fine chatters. It was in the interim [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=179.52s)]
*  Okay, it was just for a brief moment [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=185.4s)]
*  I I went to the doctor I went to urgent care and it was not like the pit at all [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=187.44s)]
*  They actually fixed it up real quick. They got me real quick [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=194.84s)]
*  and that urgent care [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=198.8s)]
*  The doctor was like, yeah, you know, we'll kiss and make it better. It's a little boo-boo [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=201.84s)]
*  It's not that big of a deal and he was right. I I was fine. I didn't even need to actually go to the doctor [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  It wasn't that big of a deal. It was just bleeding a lot [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=212.84s)]
*  But my parents freaked out over it my dad freaked out over so [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=215.56s)]
*  Yeah, we just glued it just glued up right now [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=219.88s)]
*  He just told me don't wait lift for a couple days because you don't want to like pop it open Chinese [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  That is an unreasonable glaze update. I saw somebody say you have the shadow of Guevara when you were on stage speaking up for Palestine [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=227.3s)]
*  I would call them a larper if I saw it on Twitter, but it seems like a legit compliment in China [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=233.24s)]
*  That is the greatest thing I've ever heard in my entire life. I do not deserve a compliment such as that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=236.52s)]
*  But yeah, I just I got it glued [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=240.32s)]
*  Got it wrapped up we're good to go [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  Can't be can't be working out for a couple days, but it's all good [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=246.88s)]
*  Get some good sleep over the next few days to it'll increase your healing capacity. But yeah, that's the reason why I'm late [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=251.76s)]
*  So I apologize. I was behind this guy. That's why I'm late [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=256.74s)]
*  I saw a cyber truck with a thin blue line patch on it. We are it's hog time, baby [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=259.98s)]
*  Was the terror an actual cut no it was a it was a cut [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=265.2s)]
*  Were you disappointed that it wasn't like the pit rich ass able to afford an urgent care visit chatter. I [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=269.28s)]
*  Have insurance not to flex on you, but I have a $15 copay on those things [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=276.64s)]
*  Not to flex on you chatters, but [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=286.96s)]
*  I'm not gonna flex on you. I'm not gonna flex on you. I'm not gonna flex on you [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=289.52s)]
*  I'm kind of a baller. I'm kind of a baller fam [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=295.2s)]
*  Yeah, not the flex on you, but I got insurance I got it like that when I go to urgent care [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=299.56s)]
*  It's a $15 copay. I think that's like that is unironically a flex though [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=306.12s)]
*  I saw a clip of you talking about the pit and then you got derailed by someone so you can you talk about it? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=310.98s)]
*  Please no, I talked enough about the pit. I love the pit [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=316.14s)]
*  The pit is life, but yeah, that's it. That's the that's that's what happened classic American bragging about a copay [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=319.84s)]
*  Oh, I saw this video as well. This is a funny one. We'll look at that, too [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=326.32s)]
*  But yeah, like I said [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=330.79999999999995s)]
*  We have we have a we have some fun stuff lined up in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  This in this upcoming week, so get excited for it get excited for it [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=338.84s)]
*  Socialism is when you do the colonoscopy yourself. Yeah, damn was your monthly. It's a lot. I think it's like [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=344.32s)]
*  600 700 dollars is what it was. It's crazy, dude, dude when I was when I literally went when I [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=350.64s)]
*  Left the young Turks I had to do Cobra and pay that shit out of pocket [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=359.44s)]
*  I don't know what it is now. I actually don't know and they're crazy Cobra is insane, dude [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=364.72s)]
*  Cobra is supposed to be the patchwork solution so that people who lose their jobs can still maintain their health care that they got [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=370.92s)]
*  from their corporate job [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=377.16s)]
*  for you know, I think it's like 36 months max and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  that patchwork solution [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=383.76000000000005s)]
*  basically is [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  you paying you [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=388.12s)]
*  Paying the entire premium that your corporate job [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  Sponsored basically covered so you lose your job [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=395.04s)]
*  Let's say and then you have to pay the whole thing. It's psychotic [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=398.12s)]
*  It don't make no sense socialized medicine now, please [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=402.96s)]
*  What an insane situation, please go to the wait what? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=406.28s)]
*  Check logs check logs check logs. Please don't go to the emergency room urgent care is cheaper and not the same facility [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=411.0s)]
*  Dude, what are you talking about? What do you mean check logs? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=417.28s)]
*  I just explained to you that I went to a urgent care facility already like what what are you talking about? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=421.12s)]
*  It's like it's too late already. Okay, what is this advice? You're giving like what not everything has to be like, oh my god [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  This is a matter of utmost importance, please. Have you had the ethical consideration of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=433.64000000000004s)]
*  Choosing a urgent care facility over an emergency room. God damn dude. I could be dying [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=440.68s)]
*  I could be dying. Okay bleeding from a wound and chatters would be like hey, by the way [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=446.56s)]
*  Check logs, please check logs, please. I know you're bleeding out [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=453.12s)]
*  On this live stream right now, but check logs, please [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=457.32s)]
*  Have you considered that you probably should go to urgent care because you shouldn't hold up an emergency care facility [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  Many times many in many instances the only way that poor people can get any sort of health care coverage whatsoever [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=465.52s)]
*  So, please [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=470.72s)]
*  Really reconsider your ethical [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=472.0s)]
*  Decisions that you made a lot of time urgent care was sent into an ER while charging you a bunch [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=474.08s)]
*  Then you have two bills for what you had is fine, but urgent care is usually trash to be honest [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=478.44s)]
*  Yeah, I luckily don't ever have an instance where I would like full-blown comprehensive medical care [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=482.96s)]
*  Yours if you're worried you might die urgent cares if you're sure your life is not at risk [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=489.72s)]
*  Yeah, check logs, please the notice about how you can use superglutacilla wound. Yeah [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=493.72s)]
*  I also asked the doctor who didn't say it but I felt like when he walked into the room [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=498.2s)]
*  He gave me the Hassan Abiy head look [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=504.4s)]
*  And he didn't like reveal it to me [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=507.56s)]
*  But I could tell I think he was one of you motherfuckers. He might be in the chat right now [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=510.68s)]
*  But I asked that I grilled him. I was like, so what do I do? Like let's say I'm in a island. Okay [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=515.12s)]
*  I'm in an isolated island and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=521.52s)]
*  You know playing crash situation [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=524.84s)]
*  Can I use superglue and he was like [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=527.32s)]
*  In a hypothetical scenario. He was like, you know hypothetical scenario [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=530.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes, like if you have nothing else, you know, that's that could work because I was you know, I find myself in in [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=535.88s)]
*  Deserted islands all the time genuine question. What attributes do you associate with Hassan Abiy head face? No, it's just a look [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=544.36s)]
*  It's just a look that someone [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  Gives you when someone gives me specifically when I can tell if they know who I am or not [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=552.56s)]
*  The pit does a decent job of catching some aspects of health care [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=560.04s)]
*  But it's complete fantasy in the way that it depicts the residents med students and attending physicians [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  Don't listen to your doctor. You need to reopen the wound and put leeches on it. Trust me. I'm a chatter. Yeah [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  What should someone do instead of Cobra or is that the best option? That's the only option chatter die [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=572.16s)]
*  What just someone do is that a Cobra die I guess I don't know it's like it's a sad state of affairs [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=577.12s)]
*  But you have no other option, you know [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=582.88s)]
*  What am I gonna do? There's no medical care. I can't pay for it. I guess I'll die [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  That's on ironically the method here. This is the move. That's the method [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=590.04s)]
*  That's the that's the only availability you have at your disposal [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=593.4s)]
*  Fantastic stuff we have here in America wealthiest nation on the planet. By the way, have I ever mentioned that? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=597.8000000000001s)]
*  Wealthiest nation on the fucking planet is so sick [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=603.6s)]
*  All right, let's get started there's a lot going on in the world [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=608.24s)]
*  Constitutional crisis over deportation schemes dem senator visits [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=614.84s)]
*  El Salvador El Salvador over [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=624.2s)]
*  unjustly [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  Disappointed Maryland [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=631.48s)]
*  Resident isn't there laws preventing hospitals from refusing life-saving care to underinsured and non-insured people? Yes the hospital [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=634.32s)]
*  That's why a lot of poor people will go to the emergency room [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=641.48s)]
*  Partially because they usually put it off until it's far too late [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=645.04s)]
*  because [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=648.52s)]
*  Regular checkups at a primary care facility a primary care doctor is expensive costly might not be covered by insurance [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=649.72s)]
*  Might have too much of a high copay or whatever. So most people will literally wait until the very last second [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=656.36s)]
*  When it becomes a major issue and that's the and they go and work. I mean they go and use the emergency rooms [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=664.76s)]
*  hospitals also simultaneously [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  Will will [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=675.4s)]
*  Basically farm the emergency rooms as well. They're overloaded [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=677.4s)]
*  It's really annoying it's I guess somewhat of a cost-effective alternative for them from the administrator standpoint [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, is it effing what's happening? There's I didn't experience any F's on my end [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=689.4s)]
*  Also our Medicare system encourages treatments versus preventative care. Yeah, that's the other thing you can't get preventative care preventative care is inaccessible because of price [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=697.0s)]
*  That is a major problem [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=705.96s)]
*  That's why Americans are so goddamn unhealthy that only enables them to receive short-term acute care and does not result in meaningful [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=707.3199999999999s)]
*  correction of long-term or persistent medical issues foreigners may not know yeah [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=712.9599999999999s)]
*  If you do not live in the United States of America [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=716.92s)]
*  This is a concept that is alien to you because you're like, what do you mean? You can't like [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=718.8s)]
*  Go and get a consistent medical checkup or even drugs for example [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  that you might need [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=729.64s)]
*  In a timely manner and that is because doctors visits cost money in our country and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=732.28s)]
*  Even if you have health insurance is still cost money and a lot of money as a matter of fact [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3JbVK48g4&t=738.4399999999999s)]
