# Hasan & Friends In Japan Day 3
**HasanAbi:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE)
*  So I looked down at the bill. I said, God damn, it's actually not that expensive, but it is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=0.0s)]
*  expensive, but it's not like I'm going to apologize to you level of expense. It was 375,000 yen, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=5.68s)]
*  which is very expensive. And it's especially expensive for Japan. Okay. But remember we're [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=16.4s)]
*  eating at a very nice restaurant and we're like, what, 10 people we drank alcohol, 375,000 yen is [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=22.96s)]
*  like two grand, I think, or three grand. Anyway, what I was saying is I'm like a kid in a candy [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=30.8s)]
*  store, right? I'm like a child. Here's the problem with Japan. I'm having too much fun. And I just [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=42.16s)]
*  can't, I can't get enough sleep because I'm having too much fun. Baby thing. You're blasting [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=49.36s)]
*  through my money. You don't even remember what you were getting. You give a socialist access to your [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=57.44s)]
*  What is that? That clip is crazy. Oh dude. I'm getting this overlay, by the way. I talked to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=64.64s)]
*  Haas already sent me this overlay because he's a damn G. I got to put it on, on my, on my thing, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=72.8s)]
*  on my OBS and then test it out later in the day. I love that overlay so much. As soon as I saw it, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=80.08s)]
*  I was like, that's amazing. That's the most amazing overlay I've ever seen. It's like, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  it literally looks like just straight up Japanese overlay chemistry or anyone you should [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=90.24s)]
*  think with it without control over share. We're trusted in it. Hold on. I think I found it. Oh, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=94.96s)]
*  I got to put it on. I got to put it on IRL dot run on the OBS there. Scene collection default SD. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=100.56s)]
*  Hold on. Remote OBS, IRL remote. Oh, I'm doing some expert right now in order to get the overlay. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=110.16s)]
*  And I guess like, Oh my God, I just realized something so crazy. I'm so stupid. Oh my God. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm so dumb. I didn't realize that I was, I was still talking to you guys this entire time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=126.64s)]
*  I'm so dumb, dude. I'm so dumb. I was, I thought, I thought that I was simply changing my remote OBS. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=134.32s)]
*  It turns out I was literally using my remote OBS to change the scenes this entire time. I'm so, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=146.32s)]
*  I'm so mad. I'm so mad. I'm so mad. That's, that's making me so upset anyway. But for the IRL stream, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  I just put the, I did it for the IRL stream. We can now have a Haas or anyone I give the link to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=162.0s)]
*  this kind of overlay about hair or sweat. It's just about, yeah, it's about sweat. It's about [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=170.72s)]
*  sweat. You got a small pass. What are you doing? You're burning through 300 words a day. It's crazy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=176.24s)]
*  No, they probably don't need to be changed. I'm a little OCD. I like to be clean. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=182.0s)]
*  Dude, what is going on today? Hello? Hello? What is happening right now? I'm gonna, I'm [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=186.96s)]
*  gonna get upset. I'll be honest with you. I don't know what happened, but it's kind of annoying. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=195.36s)]
*  Let me tell you, it's kind of annoying. This is piss off. What is happening? Why is my [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=201.92s)]
*  internet not working? What's happening? Connection seems poor. No, I was offline for like an extended [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=210.88s)]
*  period of time. No, my internet speed test is perfectly fine. I don't know why it's just like [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=218.16s)]
*  dropping frames. I was offline earlier because, because of my own, I'm an idiot. This, especially [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=223.92s)]
*  if you live in like LA, will was live at like 4 a.m. It is kind of crazy. There's just a, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=231.04s)]
*  at this point, there's approximately four and I'm just sleeping in those four hours. Like literally, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=237.84s)]
*  I have basically pushed limit. I'm literally doing like, I'm almost doing like a Kaisten [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  ass style 24 seven stream, like four hours in between where I'm sleeping and I take a little [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=249.44s)]
*  break. That's kind of wild. Now that I think about it, what's wrong with my life? Like with will, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=253.92s)]
*  will and I, like I wake up at 4 a.m. I started five. I go, it's all backend stuff. You don't [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  literally know a single damn thing I'm talking about. What's wrong with me? Anyway, I had a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=268.16s)]
*  fantastic time with will on will stream last night. Problem is, you know, all of that fantastic time [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  takes up time. Ray looked like death at dinner. Hope she's good. Yeah. I hope she's good too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=282.8s)]
*  Um, yeah, she was, I'm glad that there's someone out there who was just as tired as I am. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  That's all I'll say. Okay. But like will and what is happening? I just don't understand. It just like [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  cuts in and out for like one second. It's so annoying. Like I'm ready. Oh my God. I'm so mad. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay. I'm just blasting off, dude. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=308.08s)]
*  Yeah. If stream stays frozen, refresh a chat. No, it's just annoying. Like all the cuts in and out. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=316.96s)]
*  They just like have ruined the stream from the jump. It's just very, very frustrating. Anyway, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=326.88s)]
*  it's an outside a Trump force terrorists on Columbia over deportation. We know [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=333.84s)]
*  Gaza and later I'll be hitting the one piece empty. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  Is like Zorro hidden. What were you going to say? Lemow? I don't know what I was going to say. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=347.52s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. I need like, um, in Turkish, we have a saying called off. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  It means like your, um, what is this? Your poppy needs to explode. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=358.88s)]
*  Like the plant that you make opiates with. And my poppy has not exploded yet. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=364.64s)]
*  When you're a poppy, when you say my poppy hasn't exploded yet, you mean [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=372.16s)]
*  like you were so tired, like you haven't woken up yet. That's what that means. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=377.68s)]
*  It's a silly little expression. I was talking about how I got clean drunk. Oh yeah. That's true. So [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=381.36s)]
*  with will we went to capcom, the capsule, we went to the capcom capsule store [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=386.96s)]
*  and we had a lot of fun. Does anyone have a blast off? Me? And by the way, does anyone have a blast [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=395.04s)]
*  off me as it also on day Trump forces terrorists on Columbia over deportation. Trump says to clean [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=399.2s)]
*  out Gaza and later I will be hitting the one piece. Jim to get so like Zorro get it now. Oh my God. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=403.6s)]
*  It's Henry. It's Henry. Oh my God, Chad. Thank you. Thank you for making this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=408.0s)]
*  It's me and Henry, just two hot guys. Who's that? Chad doesn't know who Henry is. Maybe [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=413.6s)]
*  because you weren't watching will stream. This is how I know. But to be fair, it does make sense, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  especially if you live in like LA will was live at like 4am. It is kind of crazy. There's just a, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=427.12s)]

*  four hours. Like literally I have basically pushed the amount of hours I'm on camera to the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=438.8s)]
*  maxed out limit. I'm literally doing like, I'm almost doing like a Kyson ass style, 24 seven [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=445.36s)]
*  stream, except there's like four hours in between where I'm sleeping and I take a little break. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=452.16s)]
*  That's kind of wild. Now that I think about it, what's wrong with my life? Like with will, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=457.84000000000003s)]

*  5am to 2pm. I'm streaming right? 5am to 2pm. I'm streaming a little creatine monohydrate. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=472.32s)]
*  I'm so proud of March. We're also bringing this creatine monohydrate. That made me very happy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=480.0s)]
*  Um, little magnesium and ashwagandha and fish oil pills and the like. Anyway, um, yeah, 5am to 2pm. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=485.2s)]

*  um, regular morning content, like regular news content, desktop stuff. And then from 10pm [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=504.16s)]
*  to 10pm onward, we're doing IRL stuff, right? There are going to be some days [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  where we should push it up our love up. This is a choice. You want to change the actual format [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=516.4s)]
*  whenever you want. You know, we're not an actual infant waking you up as much as I love all the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=520.64s)]
*  content. No, I, I feel a sense of obligation, a sense of duty. Like that's not even a joke. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=524.8s)]
*  That definitely plays a formative role, but, um, and that that's for news commentary. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=530.64s)]
*  But I think that, um, I think that there's, there will be a point where I'll take a day off [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  or something or scale it back a little bit. Um, but yeah, after, so yesterday, basically what [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=541.92s)]
*  happened is I ended the stream at 2pm. We went and we found the rockabilly is the elusive rockabillies. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=553.04s)]
*  After we went and found the elusive rockabillies, we went back to Austin's hotel. We shot the podcast [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=559.76s)]

*  I started charging my bag so that I can get it ready for today. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=582.0s)]
*  We'll grabbed his bag. We went right back out, started filming. Okay. We started filming [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkS2sVS8aE&t=586.0799999999999s)]
