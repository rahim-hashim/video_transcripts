# Trump Says 'We're Going To Take Gaza' Under 'US Authority' | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM)
*  even though they're there right now, and we have no way of pushing them out, other than hoping that Israel will be able to forcibly remove them from that land and force all of the Palestinians that don't want to leave, well, them and then forcing those that don't want to leave by gunpoint to the Sinai Peninsula or into Jordan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=0.0s)]
*  And some sun with us today. So it's good to see you again. We we've had some quick discussions just now and we're going to have some longer discussion. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=30.0s)]
*  Here is the other side of the story. What Masada and CIA don't scare you Hamas can't win long. They're too powerful. I don't understand. Like if fear of powerful figures and powerful organizations were to stop me from saying the truth, I would have, you know, I would have never come out against Israel ever. Okay, this is not about Hamas winning. Okay, this is about the truth. This is about standing against the side. That's it. It's that simple. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=44.800000000000004s)]
*  For me. Holy shit. Look at this image of King Abdullah. So I talked about this yesterday about Trump saying he wants to do a mass relocation, a mass campaign of the two million close to two million Palestinians that still live in the Gaza Strip. And he wants to move them forcibly to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and also to Jordan. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=74.16s)]
*  Okay. You're not the only person who says Israel only response to force, not diplomacy. Yeah. I mean, this is Mercheimer. He's been on this for quite some time. King Abdullah is nothing but another trader. The Palestinian cause is so sad. Yeah. Here's the thing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=104.16s)]
*  Jordan as a state is basically designed by Western powers as a holdover state and historically has been used to basically keep Palestinians that have been displaced in Jordan. There are already millions of Palestinians living inside of the Jordanian boundary. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=122.24s)]
*  So for the king of Jordan, obviously, you know, an additional 500,000 Palestinians is going to be an additional 500,000 Palestinians, especially when you're, you know, when you're dumping them into a refugee camp is going to be impossible to deal with. Okay. And as I, as I mentioned before, America is claiming that if Jordan and Egypt don't like play ball and allow the to continue to happen. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=146.16s)]
*  Okay. Then they're just going to stop giving aid to Jordan. Except if they did that, then they would destabilize Jordan and Egypt. Therefore, making Jordan in Egypt no longer be successful vassal states. So this is yet another self self own by Donald Trump. Donald Trump and other people in his orbit don't understand that the aid given to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=176.88s)]
*  Egypt and the aid given to Jordan is not given to these countries because we're woke and gay and really like brown people. Okay. We really love Muslims and that's why we're giving them aid. We give these countries aid and also additional security contracts so they can remain stable vassal states. Okay. So they are not susceptible to revolution and coups. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=205.92s)]
*  Okay, that's it. And I don't think that at least Trump in the way that he's talking about the stuff understands that reality. The suspension of USA to Jordan risk destabilizing an economy where American support constitutes 7% of public revenues and 40% of total foreign aid totaling 1.45 billion annually says Milad Azar market analysts at XDB MENA. That right there is also pennies in comparison to the amount of support that we give to Egypt. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=233.6s)]
*  This is not done because this is not done simply out of the kindness of our hearts. This is done so that Jordan remains under the control of the kingdom and that they have enough money to keep funding their to keep funding their military to put down any kind of popular mobilization against the monarchy. Same goes for Egypt. Okay. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=263.6s)]
*  Here is anyway, let's watch this conversation that took place and I'll give you more details. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=294.48s)]
*  Discussions after this and the relationship with Jordan has been very strong has been with me and I really has been with the country. But I think I've been closer than other presidents to Jordan and what Jordan represents. And it's an honor to have you and your [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=299.68s)]
*  Why would Trump care of Jordan stay stable? I don't know. Do you want a country from Trump's perspective? Okay. If you are a advisor to Donald Trump, who is at least some somewhat knowledgeable about Middle Eastern affairs. Okay. Do you think that a nation state that is controlled by a Hashemi monarchy that was placed in that position of power by the British government that is a loyal servant of Western interests is better than the country that you're in? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=317.0s)]
*  In the hands of said Hashemite monarch? Or is it better if the 3 million Palestinians were to actually do a successful coup and then use Jordan as a launching pad for any kind of West Bank military operations that they want to conduct? Now, if you're if you're an advisor to Donald Trump, you look at that situation to go Mr. President, please don't say this because then this will lead to like significant [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=347.0s)]
*  political turmoil in Jordan, it will destabilize Jordan and its entirety. And then you will lose a stronghold that has been a reliable ally in the Israeli defense against other regional actors. You guys forget Jordan is a part of the security cooperation in the region. When Iran was sending missiles into Israel, Jordanian, Jordanian, the Jordanian Air Force was intercepting those missiles. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=377.0s)]
*  Okay, the same goes for Egypt as well. This already happened in Egypt once where the Muslim Brotherhood, the Muslim Brotherhood took over Egypt. This was obviously not not an exciting prospect for the American government. Nor was it exciting for Israel. It was terrifying. Okay, sources to l Arabia, say the Egyptian and up the photo l CC visit the Washington Post bone until further notice. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=406.88000000000005s)]
*  Cairo is angry at the statements of Israel and America and send a clear message to Washington. Egypt has two plans to rebuild Gaza without displacing his residence. Cairo has a ready response regarding Gaza file and there's no change in it. The problem here. Okay, the problem here with this, with this delicate allegiance that we have designed in the region with regional actors such as Egypt and Jordan. Okay, is that this level of destabilization is not immediately going to be beneficial for the Palestinians either. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=435.56s)]
*  Okay, and this also will give Israel the opportunity to further invade Jordan and Egypt if necessary. Now, the problem is Israel can't do it on its own. There is no way that Israel would be able to launch a seven front war. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=465.72s)]
*  Okay, and go into Egypt and also go into Jordan at the same time and take over additional land from both of these countries. That might be a part of their greater Israel agenda, but they don't have the resources to do that. So who would have to do that for Israel? Think about it. Who would have to do that for Israel? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=482.72s)]
*  We would our military. Okay. Our military. Yes. Genuine question. Why spend money and give aid to Jordan who takes in displaced Palestinians rather than finally coming up with a two state solution. What do you mean? This has been, this is, you're talking about the last century of deal making. It's too late to change that. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=502.72s)]
*  Something that a lot like I use this example with the Saudi state, right? With the Saudi kingdom, MBS personally does not care about the plight of the Palestinians. He actually finds them in private to be a nuisance. He's openly revealed that position time and time again. He just wants to do sports washing. He wants the Saudi sovereign wealth fund to keep purchasing Western assets. He wants to normalize openly normalized relations with Israel. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=527.72s)]
*  But why does MBS create a red line when he consistently talks about like Israel doing a full blown ethnic cleansing? Why does Saudi Arabia, why does MBS openly state that they want a 67 boundary return to a two state solution? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=555.72s)]
*  Okay. Why does he want that? Because even Saudi Arabia understands that the Saudi public's demands are directly at odds with MBS's own personal interest. Okay. It does not matter what MBS personally thinks of the Palestinians. What matters is what the broader population in every Gulf state and what they think. Okay. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=578.72s)]
*  You would have to spend a lot of your security, a lot of your military on squashing popular uprisings in your own country because your people would lose their minds if it looked like you were actively and openly caving to Israel and allowing Israel to murder as many Palestinians as possible. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=608.72s)]
*  This is why here it is. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appreciates the condemnation, disapproval and total rejection announced by the brotherly countries towards what Benjamin and Yahoo stated regarding the displacement of the Palestinian people from their land and the kingdom values the positions that emphasize the centrality of the Palestinian issue to the Arab and Muslim countries. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=632.72s)]
*  Like MBS, MBS would love it if all the Palestinians magically overnight died. Okay. And the Palestinian cause went away. He would love it. So why is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stating this? Why is it that all of their official statements on the matter are very anti-Israel? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=648.72s)]
*  When we know MBS has time and time again repeated that he doesn't really care about Palestinians at all and sees them as a nuisance. Yeah. Saudi crown prince said he personally doesn't care about the Palestinian issue. The young Saudi population were Saudi Arabia's crown prince. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=669.72s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman told us secretary of state Anthony Blinken that he does not personally cared about what he referred to as the Palestinian issue. According to a report in the Atlantic published on Wednesday, the report gave a picture of 11 months of Washington negotiation efforts in the region. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=684.72s)]
*  After the outbreak of the war in Gaza, citing two dozen participants at the highest level of government in America and across the Middle East. Moin Rabbani talked about this on Al Jazeera. Can we watch this? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=697.72s)]
*  Moin Rabbani is a resident fellow at the Center for conflict and humanitarian studies and joins us from Montreal. Moin, thanks so much for being with us on Al Jazeera. Let me ask you first about the fact that Jordan's King Abdullah is heading to Washington, D.C. tomorrow, as I understand it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=708.72s)]
*  This was always going to be something that Trump was potentially going to use to potentially put pressure on Jordan's King to try and take in more Palestinians. Correct? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=723.72s)]
*  I mean, that's what we've heard from Trump over the course of the past few weeks is that Jordan and also Egypt should be taking in more Palestinians. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=736.72s)]
*  We expect more of this at this meeting. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=744.72s)]
*  Yes, and I think the Arab states who have been fundamentally inert for the past 15, 16 months are now coming to the realization that the alternative to an anti-Israeli occupation, the alternative to a Palestinian state in Palestine is a policy of their own countries and instability and insecurity within their own borders. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=746.72s)]
*  And I think it's on this basis that you're now seeing this much more concerted Arab response and Arab rejection of policy proposals emanating from the U.S. and Israel. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=763.72s)]
*  That's clearly why the Jordanian monarch is in Washington. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=773.72s)]
*  That's also why Egypt is in Washington. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=776.72s)]
*  It explains the unprecedented campaign in the Saudi media. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=778.72s)]
*  And basically, I think what Trump and Netanyahu have done in the past two days is administratively and politically, they've been trying to get the right people to come to the table. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=783.72s)]
*  I mean, to say, yes, there should be a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia, where Jordan is the Palestinian homeland, and all the rest of it is just a question of whether or not they're going to be able to do that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=793.72s)]
*  I mean, to say, yes, there should be a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia, where Jordan is the Palestinian homeland, and all the rest of it is clearly not going to fly. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=806.72s)]
*  I mean, let's not forget these are the most pro-Western Arab regimes in the Middle East. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=826.72s)]
*  I mean, let's not forget these are the most pro-Western Arab regimes in the Middle East. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=833.72s)]

*  Why would Jordan become unstable? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=851.72s)]
*  Brain deck comment. It has its own fighting force. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=853.72s)]
*  Be for real, brother. Jordan can defend itself. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=855.72s)]
*  Hassan be for real, brother. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=857.72s)]

*  I don't even run ads any longer. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=867.72s)]
*  Chatter, god damn. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=869.72s)]
*  Even if I did, that would still be a two-parter, which was rendered illegal. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=871.72s)]

*  You're a year late. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=875.72s)]
*  Is this dynamic similar in Turkey? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=877.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=879.72s)]
*  Recep Tayyip Erdogan loves the contracts that he has with Israel. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=881.72s)]

*  His son directly benefits from it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=885.72s)]
*  He has a shipping company. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=887.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=889.72s)]
*  But the Turkish population, obviously, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=891.72s)]
*  But the Turkish population, obviously, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=893.72s)]
*  has a very different attitude towards Israel. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=895.72s)]
*  And this is precisely the reason why [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=897.72s)]

*  not rising up against him. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=957.72s)]
*  But on the other hand, he is a NATO nation. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=959.72s)]
*  But on the other hand, he is a NATO nation. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=961.72s)]
*  And by the way, he's been rewarded handsomely [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=963.72s)]
*  And by the way, he's been rewarded handsomely [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=965.72s)]
*  for playing ball with America's [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=967.72s)]
*  interest in the region and playing ball with Israel. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=969.72s)]
*  Look at Syria. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=971.72s)]
*  Syria is a great [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=973.72s)]
*  example of Recep Tayyip Erdogan [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=975.72s)]
*  getting many benefits for [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=977.72s)]
*  being Israel's lap dog, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=979.72s)]
*  loyal servant. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=981.72s)]
*  If you look at the developments these past few hours [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=993.72s)]
*  and there have been a lot of developments [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=995.72s)]
*  with all that's transpired, what do you make of all this [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=997.72s)]
*  and what do you think might happen next? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=999.72s)]
*  Well, unless you're reading [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1001.72s)]
*  the New York Times or watching the BBC, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1003.72s)]
*  it's transparently obvious [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1005.72s)]
*  what's going on. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1007.72s)]
*  And that includes readers and viewers [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1009.72s)]
*  of the Israeli media. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1011.72s)]
*  You have this combination [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1013.72s)]
*  of Israeli [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1015.72s)]
*  violations of the agreement [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1017.72s)]
*  ratified by Israel and Hamas [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1019.72s)]
*  and that began implementation a few weeks ago. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1021.72s)]
*  You have [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1023.72s)]
*  Israeli intentions [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1025.72s)]
*  not to negotiate the second [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1027.72s)]
*  phase of this agreement, which would lead [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1029.72s)]
*  to a durable [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1031.72s)]
*  ceasefire rather than just [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1033.72s)]
*  a suspension of hostilities. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1035.72s)]
*  You have [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1037.72s)]
*  Netanyahu seeking to drag out [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1039.72s)]
*  the first phase of the [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1041.72s)]
*  ceasefire so that Israel [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1043.72s)]
*  can retrieve all of its captives [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1045.72s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip without [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1047.72s)]
*  in exchange [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1049.72s)]
*  calling time on its [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1051.72s)]
*  genocidal military campaign on the Gaza Strip [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1053.72s)]
*  to then be able to resume it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1055.72s)]
*  And overlaying all of this, you have [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1057.72s)]
*  the Trump proposal for the mass forcible [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1059.72s)]
*  displacement of every last [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1061.72s)]
*  Palestinian from the Gaza Strip [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1063.72s)]
*  to the Arab world. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1065.72s)]
*  And Hamas is using [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1067.72s)]
*  what leverage it does have and is [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1069.72s)]
*  announcing that it is indefinitely [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1071.72s)]
*  suspending the further exchange [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1073.72s)]
*  of captives with Israel until [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1075.72s)]
*  Israel decides to actually [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1077.72s)]
*  implement what it signed. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1079.72s)]
*  And more importantly, until Washington [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1081.72s)]
*  makes up its mind about the future [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1083.72s)]
*  of this agreement because at the end of the day [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1085.72s)]
*  Netanyahu can say what [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1087.72s)]
*  he wants and do what he wants. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1089.72s)]
*  But the crucial decisions about the future [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1091.72s)]
*  of this agreement are going to [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1093.72s)]
*  be made by Washington. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1095.72s)]
*  And Washington will [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1097.72s)]
*  have to decide whether it will [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1099.72s)]
*  compel Israel to continue with the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1101.72s)]
*  implementation of this agreement [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1103.72s)]
*  or allow Israel to derail it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1105.72s)]
*  Moan, just quickly, we only have about a couple [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1107.72s)]
*  of minutes left here, but just very quickly, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1109.72s)]
*  what from your perspective [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1111.72s)]
*  has to happen in order for [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1113.72s)]
*  this ceasefire deal to continue? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1115.72s)]
*  Well, Israel [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1117.72s)]
*  can't once again, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1119.72s)]
*  you know, you negotiate an agreement, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1121.72s)]
*  then you negotiate how you implement [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1123.72s)]
*  it, and then once it begins [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1125.72s)]
*  implementation, you [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1127.72s)]
*  negotiate a thoroughgoing [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1129.72s)]
*  revision and transformation [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1131.72s)]
*  of that agreement. That's not going to [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1133.72s)]
*  fly. There is an agreement reached, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1135.72s)]
*  you either implement it [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1137.72s)]
*  or you don't and you suffer the consequences. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1139.72s)]
*  And the question now is, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1141.72s)]
*  will Israel be allowed [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1143.72s)]
*  to derail this agreement by not fulfilling [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1145.72s)]
*  its obligations or will [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1147.72s)]
*  it be forced to comply? It really is [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1149.72s)]
*  that simple. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1151.72s)]
*  Alright. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1153.72s)]
*  Well, Moan, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1155.72s)]
*  I mean, do you foresee that [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1157.72s)]
*  what you're talking about that needs to [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1159.72s)]
*  happen? Do you foresee it actually happening? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1161.72s)]
*  You know, you're asking me a very difficult [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1165.72s)]
*  question because with this [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1167.72s)]
*  crew in the White House now, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1169.72s)]
*  and particularly with President Trump, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1171.72s)]
*  I mean, trying to [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1173.72s)]
*  understand his political agenda [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1175.72s)]
*  is a little bit like trying to [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1177.72s)]
*  We'll get to Trump and Elon in the White House in a second [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1179.72s)]
*  after this is over. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1181.72s)]
*  ... the political analysis of yogurt. It's entirely [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1183.72s)]
*  unclear. You know, on the one hand, he [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1185.72s)]
*  forced Israel to accept [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1187.72s)]
*  this agreement and now is making [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1189.72s)]
*  a proposal that makes it thoroughly [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1191.72s)]
*  irrelevant. Is he just throwing [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1193.72s)]
*  up trial balloons and seeing [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1195.72s)]
*  you know, which spaghetti strand [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1197.72s)]
*  sticks to which wall? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1199.72s)]
*  Moan. Is he being... [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1201.72s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt, but we have run out of time [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1203.72s)]
*  so we're going to have to leave the conversation. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1205.72s)]
*  Alright. Give me the link. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1207.72s)]
*  Give me the link for [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1209.72s)]
*  the [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1211.72s)]
*  Elon talks. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1213.72s)]
*  ... with us today and if you'd [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1215.72s)]
*  like to say a few words and thank you very much. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1217.72s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you very much for having us [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1219.72s)]
*  and so short after your [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1221.72s)]
*  inauguration, I think just as a testament [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1223.72s)]
*  to what you said is a special relationship [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1225.72s)]
*  between our two countries and [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1227.72s)]
*  the personal relationship of [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1229.72s)]
*  friendship and trust between the two of us. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1231.72s)]
*  Mr. President, I truly [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1233.72s)]
*  believe that with all the challenges that we have [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1235.72s)]
*  in the Middle East that I finally see [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1237.72s)]
*  somebody that can take us across the finish [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1239.72s)]
*  line to bring stability, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1241.72s)]
*  peace and prosperity [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1243.72s)]
*  to all of us in the region. And it is, I think, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1245.72s)]
*  our collective responsibility in the Middle [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1247.72s)]
*  East to continue to work with you, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1249.72s)]
*  to support you, to achieve those [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1251.72s)]
*  lofty goals. So I'm very delighted to be here [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1253.72s)]
*  and as you said, sir, we've got some very interesting [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1255.72s)]
*  questions. Very good. Thank you very much. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1257.72s)]
*  Mr. President, many people in the region, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1259.72s)]
*  especially Jordan, are worried about [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1261.72s)]
*  the annexation of the West Bank. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1263.72s)]
*  Will you give His Majesty the King [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1265.72s)]
*  guarantee that you won't allow Israel [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1267.72s)]
*  to annex the West Bank? And how are you [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1269.72s)]
*  going to... I think that's going to work out very well. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1271.72s)]
*  I think that's not really what we're talking about today. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1273.72s)]
*  I think that's something that's going to work out [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1275.72s)]
*  automatically and it's [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1277.72s)]
*  in good shape. And [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1279.72s)]
*  we discussed it. Other people [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1281.72s)]
*  have discussed it with us and with me. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1283.72s)]
*  That's going to work out. West Bank is [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1285.72s)]
*  going to work out very well. Mr. President, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1287.72s)]
*  why should the King take in the Palestinian people? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1289.72s)]
*  He's made clear he doesn't want to. Well, I don't [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1291.72s)]
*  know, but he may have just something to say [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1293.72s)]
*  because we discussed just briefly [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1295.72s)]
*  I think maybe [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1297.72s)]
*  you want to say it now or? Well, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1299.72s)]
*  Mr. President, I think [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1301.72s)]
*  we have to keep in mind [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1303.72s)]
*  that there is a plan from [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1305.72s)]
*  Egypt and the Arab countries. We're being [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1307.72s)]
*  invited by Mohammed bin Salman to discussions [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1309.72s)]
*  in Riyadh. I think the point is [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1311.72s)]
*  how do we make this work in a way that is [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1313.72s)]
*  good for everybody. Obviously, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1315.72s)]
*  we have to look at the best [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1317.72s)]
*  interests of the United States, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1319.72s)]
*  of the people in the region, especially to my [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1321.72s)]
*  people of Jordan. And we're going to have [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1323.72s)]
*  some interesting discussions today. I think [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1325.72s)]
*  one of the things that we can do right away [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1327.72s)]
*  is take 2,000 [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1329.72s)]
*  children that are either [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1331.72s)]
*  cancer children or in very [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1333.72s)]
*  ill state to Jordan [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1335.72s)]
*  as quickly as possible. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1337.72s)]
*  And then wait for, I think, the Egyptians [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1339.72s)]
*  to present their plan on how we can work [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1341.72s)]
*  with the President to work [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1343.72s)]
*  on the challenges. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1345.72s)]
*  I want to tell you [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1347.72s)]
*  excuse me, please. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1349.72s)]
*  I didn't know that [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1351.72s)]
*  what you just said, 2,000 children [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1353.72s)]
*  with cancer or other problems. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1355.72s)]
*  And that's really [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1357.72s)]
*  a beautiful gesture. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1359.72s)]
*  That's really good and we appreciate it. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1361.72s)]
*  And we'll be working on the rest [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1363.72s)]
*  with Egypt. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1365.72s)]
*  I think you're going to see some [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1367.72s)]
*  great progress. I think with Jordan [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1369.72s)]
*  you're going to see some great progress. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1371.72s)]
*  Three of us will have some others helping [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1373.72s)]
*  and we're going to have some others at a very high [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1375.72s)]
*  level helping. And the whole thing will [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1377.72s)]
*  come. It's not a complex thing to do. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1379.72s)]
*  And with the United States being [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1381.72s)]
*  in control of that. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1383.72s)]
*  Egyptian Foreign Ministry has dropped [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1385.72s)]
*  a statement as well. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1387.72s)]
*  Egyptian Foreign Ministry has shared a statement saying [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1389.72s)]
*  it will propose a comprehensive plan for [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1391.72s)]
*  Gaza's reconstruction to ensure Palestinians [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1393.72s)]
*  can remain on their land. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1395.72s)]
*  It stresses that any [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1397.72s)]
*  resolution to the conflict must uphold regional peace [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1399.72s)]
*  and Israel's occupation [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1401.72s)]
*  and implement a two state solution. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1403.72s)]
*  It added that Egypt would work with US President Trump [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1405.72s)]
*  to achieve a just settlement for Palestinians. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1407.72s)]
*  Egypt is not playing ball [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1409.72s)]
*  to the same degree as [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1411.72s)]
*  King Abdullah is. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1413.72s)]
*  In his statement King Abdullah is rewriting history. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1415.72s)]
*  He never said this to Trump in front of the cameras. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1417.72s)]
*  He kept talking about a summit with MBS in Egypt and said [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1419.72s)]
*  I reiterated Jordan's steadfast position [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1421.72s)]
*  against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1423.72s)]
*  and West Bank. Yeah, he didn't. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1425.72s)]
*  And what he did instead was say [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1427.72s)]
*  oh yeah we'll take two million children. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1429.72s)]
*  I mean not two million children. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1431.72s)]
*  Two thousand children [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1433.72s)]
*  to basically [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1435.72s)]
*  get Trump to shut the fuck up. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1437.72s)]
*  Okay, that's it. Sorry. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1439.72s)]
*  I said two million accidentally. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1441.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's just basically [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1443.72s)]
*  to say like yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll do something. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1445.72s)]
*  It's the same thing that like [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1447.72s)]
*  Claudia Scheinbaum did or the same thing [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1449.72s)]
*  that [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1451.72s)]
*  the same thing that Justin Trudeau did [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1453.72s)]
*  when they were like oh we're going to move [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1455.72s)]
*  more people to the border. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1457.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1459.72s)]
*  This is unified Arab. This is the unified Arab position [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1461.72s)]
*  rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1463.72s)]
*  the dire humanitarian situation [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1465.72s)]
*  should be priority for all anyway. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1467.72s)]
*  A piece of land, a fairly large piece of land, you're going to have stability in the Middle East for the first time. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1471.72s)]
*  And the Palestinians or the people that live now in Gaza will be living beautifully in another location. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1481.72s)]
*  They're going to be living safely. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1487.72s)]
*  They're not going to be killed, murdered, and having to leave every ten years. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1489.72s)]
*  Because I've been watching this for so many years. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1493.72s)]
*  It's nothing but truans being killed. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1495.72s)]
*  They're being robbed. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1497.72s)]
*  It's like living in hell. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1499.72s)]
*  And they're going to end up having a great home, great families that don't have to get mugged and killed and beaten up and harassed by Hamas and everybody else. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1501.72s)]
*  And I know we'll be able to work something. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1513.72s)]
*  And what you just said about the 2000 is fantastic. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1515.72s)]
*  It's so beautiful. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1517.72s)]
*  It's music to my ears. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1519.72s)]
*  But we're going to be able to work something. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1521.72s)]
*  And I know we'll be able to work something also with the people that live in Gaza. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1523.72s)]
*  I believe not 100 percent, but 99 percent we're going to work out something with Egypt. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1525.72s)]
*  Mr. President, how is the U.S. going to own Gaza? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1535.72s)]
*  Your White House has made clear taxpayer dollars won't be used for this. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1537.72s)]
*  So what money are you going to use to buy Gaza? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1539.72s)]
*  We're not going to buy anything. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1541.72s)]
*  We're going to have it. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1543.72s)]
*  We're going to keep it. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1545.72s)]
*  And we're going to make sure that there's going to be peace. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1547.72s)]
*  And we're going to make sure that we're going to have a peaceful process. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1549.72s)]
*  And we're going to keep it and we're going to make sure that there's going to be peace. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1551.72s)]
*  And there's not going to be any problem. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1553.72s)]
*  And nobody's going to question it. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1555.72s)]
*  And we're going to run it very properly. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1557.72s)]
*  And eventually we'll have economic development at a very large scale, maybe the largest scale on that site. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1559.72s)]
*  And we'll have lots of good things built there, including hotels and office buildings and housing and other things. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1561.72s)]
*  And we'll make that site into what it should be. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1563.72s)]
*  Yeah, just the Palestinians won't be able to live on it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1565.72s)]
*  Even though they're going to be able to live on it. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1567.72s)]
*  And we're going to be able to build a new home. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1569.72s)]
*  And we're going to be able to build a new home. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1571.72s)]
*  And we're going to be able to build a new home. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1573.72s)]
*  And we're going to be able to build a new home. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1575.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's just the Palestinians won't be able to live on it, even though they're there right now. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1577.72s)]
*  And we have no way of pushing them out other than hoping that Israel will be able to forcibly remove them from that land and force all of the Palestinians that don't want to leave. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1583.72s)]
*  Well, killing them and then forcing those that don't want to leave by gunpoint to the Sinai Peninsula or into Jordan. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1597.72s)]
*  Great stuff overall. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1609.72s)]
*  Now, it's interesting because this is not a new concept. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1611.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1617.72s)]
*  This is not a new concept at all. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1619.72s)]
*  This is actually virtually identical to Hitler's Lebensraum strategy and the Madagascar deportation. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1621.72s)]
*  The Madagascar plan that he wanted to initially implement, taking all the Jews and sending them to Madagascar. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1630.72s)]
*  It is identical. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1640.72s)]
*  A one to one copy. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1641.72s)]
*  And many people are many people in Israel are totally on board with the idea. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1643.72s)]
*  I wonder why here is here is one of the conceptualizations that they've put forward. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1649.72s)]
*  Okay. That Nathan Robinson also correctly called out. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1656.72s)]
*  This is the exact same plan that the Nazis the Nazis had to send the Jews to Madagascar. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1659.72s)]
*  An intriguing suggestion has been proposed with the problem of relocating Gaza Arab Palestinians south of the Arabian Peninsula is an island called Scotra. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1664.72s)]
*  It is the sufficient size and has almost no habitants. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1671.72s)]
*  The location is far from the Jews that the Palestinians despise so much and closer to the Arab brethren. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1673.72s)]
*  With a water buffer zone to keep them at bay literally as the other Arabs prefer. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1678.72s)]
*  It is also a beautiful paradise with even more beachfront property than Gaza. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1683.72s)]
*  Twenty five thousand likes. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1687.72s)]
*  Fox now justifying ethnic cleansing in the most blatant ways possible. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1701.72s)]
*  This population in Palestine is hostile, uneducated. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1704.72s)]
*  Literally wrong. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1710.72s)]
*  The Palestinian population is more educated than the Israeli population on average. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1711.72s)]
*  This is incorrect. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1715.72s)]
*  The Palestinian population has a higher higher educational retainment per capita, a higher rate of college educated people than than the Israeli population has. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1716.72s)]
*  It's just just a lie. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1728.72s)]
*  A racist lie. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1729.72s)]
*  It's even more radicalized than they were at the beginning of this. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1730.72s)]
*  I mean, now they have no homes at all. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1735.72s)]
*  They're even more hateful of the Israelis and their birth rate is explosive. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1737.72s)]
*  The average Palestinian woman has five and a half babies. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1742.72s)]
*  The average Israeli woman has only two and a half babies. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1746.72s)]
*  So demographically, they're a threat not to mention the insane thing to state like this is just pure nonsense. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1750.72s)]
*  This is just pure Nazi shit. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1757.72s)]
*  I don't know how else to I don't know how to cover this. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1759.72s)]
*  It's just a it's just pure Nazi sentiment. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1762.72s)]
*  He said that they are their population is explosive. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1766.72s)]
*  They're just having too many children. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1769.72s)]
*  It's a demographic issue. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1771.72s)]
*  Yeah. How do you deal with that? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1773.72s)]
*  It's just, you know, forcibly sterilize them, I guess. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1774.72s)]
*  Men has only two and a half babies. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1777.72s)]
*  So demographically, they're a threat not to mention the national security threat. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1780.72s)]
*  There is no way you can have these two peoples living side by side. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1785.72s)]
*  I don't think Kamala would have said these things. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1790.72s)]
*  Hey, who was it that said Trump and Kamala would be the same for Palestine? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1791.72s)]
*  Yeah, dude, you do realize that Kamala Harris lost because she wouldn't separate herself from Joe Biden on any issue. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1795.72s)]
*  Even the least popular one, which was Israel, Palestine. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1802.72s)]
*  And that is the reason why Trump won. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1807.72s)]
*  You recognize that, right? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1809.72s)]
*  I like that this is an opportunity for you to say who would say that Kamala and Trump are not the same as one another. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1811.72s)]
*  First and foremost, the Biden administration, which Kamala Harris also aligned with. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1818.72s)]
*  OK, she was the vice president after all and refused to separate herself from the Biden administration. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1822.72s)]
*  Also actively tried to quietly push forward the exact same Trump agenda of ethnic displacement. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1828.72s)]
*  They did do that. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1836.72s)]
*  They actually actively tried to get regional partners in Jordan and Egypt to take on hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1837.72s)]
*  OK, they try to do that just because just because they were masquerading in like a better propaganda, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1846.72s)]
*  making it seem as though they were trying their very best to do something that's very different than Donald Trump doesn't change that reality. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1855.72s)]
*  Having said that, I didn't say Kamala Harris and Donald Trump would be the same on Israel anyway. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1863.72s)]
*  I have long maintained the position that American foreign policy is uniparty and the Republicans only make it more right wing. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1868.72s)]
*  And then the Democrats come in and don't actually reverse those decisions because American foreign policy at the end of the day is still uniparty. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1876.72s)]
*  Perhaps the greatest evidence of this was Joe Biden coming in after Donald Trump and not overturning any of the Abraham Accords, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1883.72s)]
*  moving the embassy to Jerusalem, the permanent annexation of Syrian territory and Golan Heights for Israel. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1891.72s)]
*  And then who could forget the past 16 months of genocide that came directly because Biden did not offer Palestinians an exit ramp or any sort of recognition whatsoever in the three years that he was president. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1897.72s)]
*  And on the fourth, obviously, October 7 happened. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1910.72s)]
*  The only difference in this process is the aesthetics. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1915.72s)]
*  The Democrats act as though they have some semblance of some veneer of caring about the international rule based order. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1922.72s)]
*  That's it. That's it. The optics are different. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1932.72s)]
*  They try to do their very best to present a falsehood. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1935.72s)]
*  The rhetoric is different, but I guess that's enough for many of you. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1940.72s)]
*  Like when Donald Trump, Palsy type crash out 20 minutes ago, crash house. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1944.72s)]
*  What are you talking about? When Donald Trump talks about how Gaza is leveled, who was overseeing the leveling of Gaza is the question one must ask themselves. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1949.72s)]
*  Who do you think the Democrats will be proposing the move of Palestinians out of Gaza? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1958.72s)]
*  I'm not thinking that I'm saying that the Joe Biden administration also tried to do that. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1962.72s)]
*  The only difference is Donald Trump says the quiet part out loud. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1967.72s)]
*  Okay. What are you talking about? The Associated Press reported on it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1971.72s)]
*  Also, even without the Associated Press reporting on that dealing from the Biden administration, how did the bombs get there? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1977.72s)]
*  Who bombed Gaza? Why is Gaza completely leveled? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1988.72s)]
*  I'm so confused. Are we actually trying to do harm reduction arguments between what the most effective ways of doing genocide is? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=1992.72s)]
*  Is it better to just do mass forcible ethnic displacement? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2002.72s)]
*  But we would not be in a position where everyone is fearing that Trump is literally going to ethnic cleanse Palestine. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2006.72s)]
*  Okay, chatter. I'm going to try to explain something to you. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2012.72s)]
*  Under the Biden leadership, the ethnic cleansing campaign had already started. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2016.72s)]
*  Okay. And the Biden administration kept giving more and more weapons and never actually stopping the Israeli government in their ethnic cleansing campaign. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2022.72s)]
*  They also purposefully looked the other way when there were numerous State Department controlled agencies that reported what the NGOs and humanitarian organizations were reporting from the ground in terms of Israel violating international rights, engaging in a litany of war crimes, actively doing a genocide. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2033.72s)]
*  They looked the other way. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2057.72s)]
*  They buried the information that was presented to them so they could continue Israel's genocidal campaign. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2060.72s)]
*  Okay. The notion that there is a significant difference here is idiotic saying which way, which type of ethnic cleansing is better. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2069.72s)]
*  That's what you're being forced to choose. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2081.72s)]
*  Okay. Is it better when we destroy all of the buildings and kill people and you know, and have them die under the rubble? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2085.72s)]
*  Or is it better that we kill them when they refuse to leave? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2096.72s)]
*  You're confused. Gaza got leveled and starved these past two weeks, not the past year. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2099.72s)]
*  Exactly. I guess for you, the major difference is you don't want to hear about it. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2103.72s)]
*  Or rather the Democrats at least the Democrats at least were able to to make you feel better about the genocide because they kept lying and saying there are red lines. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2109.72s)]
*  They kept lying and saying that they're working tirelessly around the clock for a ceasefire. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2121.72s)]
*  Okay. It does not make sense. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2128.72s)]
*  The worst part about it from your standards also, if you are interested only in team sports and nothing else, is that it would have been beneficial for Kamala Harris to actively communicate a different perspective on Gaza to actively separate herself from the Biden administration. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2130.72s)]
*  It would have been electorally beneficial for her, but due to her loyalty and due to her interest in maintaining the current administration's foreign policy goals, she did not do that. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2151.72s)]
*  And she didn't do that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2166.72s)]
*  And she lost. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2167.72s)]
*  So even if you want to talk about this from a purely partisan perspective, she could have done things. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2168.72s)]
*  Even if it was a lie, she could have still at least had the decency to lie to the American public. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2176.72s)]
*  They didn't even want to lie. Trump at least lied, by the way. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2182.72s)]
*  I mean, it was obvious that he was lying. I reported on it at the time. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2185.72s)]
*  I told you that there was no way that Donald Trump got one hundred million dollars from Mary Maddison was going to actually deviate away from the pro-Israel position. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2188.72s)]
*  But at least he fucking went to Dearborn and was like, oh, falafels. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2198.72s)]
*  It's great. I love you guys. I'm going to end it. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2201.72s)]
*  I'm going to end all of it. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2203.72s)]
*  Democrats literally didn't even lie to the American public when it was electorally beneficial for them. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2205.72s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2210.72s)]
*  They actively turned around and said, no, we don't want you in the party. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2211.72s)]
*  We don't want you to vote for us. We're going to win without you. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2217.72s)]
*  They didn't even want to fucking play politics. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2219.72s)]
*  It's crazy. Anyway, so the notion that like, oh, man, well, you got what you deserved. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2221.72s)]
*  Pro-Palestinians or whatever is an idiotic thing to say, especially because I also said Donald Trump would take it one step further than the Democratic Party for sure in terms of West Bank annexation. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2228.72s)]
*  OK. And that it was I never I never said that Donald Trump was pro-Palestinian and said the exact opposite. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2240.72s)]
*  But the very fact that the Democratic Party lost a decent chunk of the Muslim voters to a guy that did the Muslim ban that used Palestinian as a slur as a pejorative is insane to me. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2248.72s)]
*  How can you look at the situation and not get mad at the Democratic Party? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2264.72s)]
*  How can you look at the situation and go, we have to never run campaigns like this ever again? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2268.72s)]
*  You explain it like it's your fault. Kamala could invoice her support for genocide loud enough for certain liberals. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2273.72s)]
*  Yeah. Why even argue who doesn't get that there is a genocide in Gaza since Biden is lost? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2278.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. It's not my fault, but it doesn't matter. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2283.72s)]
*  People are people have horse blinders on and they're desperately looking to attack anyone and everyone they can. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2286.72s)]
*  And the new meta from a lot of like extremely online liberals is to say, oh, Hassan is the reason why Kamala Harris lost. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2293.72s)]
*  It makes no sense, but it's a comfortable narrative for a lot of people so that they don't have to look at the Democratic Party and say, oh, man, they are the reason they lost this all on their own. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2301.72s)]
*  And the people from Gaza who wouldn't be able to be there for years because you're talking about just to get it and prepare it and to take care of all of the problems that currently it has, as you know, tunnels and people are in those tunnels. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2314.72s)]
*  And you have some good people and some bad people. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2327.72s)]
*  And you may have hostages right now. You know, you have the hostages possibly there. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2330.72s)]
*  They don't know where they are. And, you know, I have a Saturday deadline and I don't think they're going to make the deadline personally. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2335.72s)]
*  I think they they want to play tough guy, but we'll see how tough they are. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2342.72s)]
*  But it's what is this? No, the only dick riding idiot is you bending over for Trump thinking he's different. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2347.72s)]
*  What? Also, you literally Democrats actively advocating for genocide on the Palestinians. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2354.72s)]
*  What is happening here? Why are you guys fucking fighting one another? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2358.72s)]
*  Oh, I love that. When when all else fails, when everything is falling apart, I love when liberals look to blame leftist and the left is look to blame other leftists. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2361.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's the reason chatters are just fighting each other. Great stuff, guys. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2371.72s)]
*  It's going to be a wonderful thing. It's going to be wonderful for the Middle East. I think it'll turn the Middle East. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2375.72s)]
*  I think you're going to have peace in the Middle East. You're going to eventually have peace in the Middle East. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2380.72s)]
*  Couldn't this deadline risk undermining the talks that you're having with the king today? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2384.72s)]
*  Risk the kind of wider piece that you're trying to? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2391.72s)]
*  Because that's not we're not talking about a big situation. We're talking about something that can go very quickly. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2394.72s)]
*  We're talking about it's going to go quickly. It's not going to take a long time. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2400.72s)]
*  Okay. That's not going to take a long time. You know, bullies, you know, the bully is right. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2403.72s)]
*  You know, the bully always. And I found it throughout my life. A bully is the weakest person and their bullies, Hamas's bullies. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2408.72s)]
*  Dude, that's so funny. Claiming that the bully is the weakest person, which is true. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2417.72s)]
*  And then not recognizing that you not recognizing that you yourself are the bully is crazy. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2422.72s)]
*  The weakest people are bullies. You know that, right? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2429.72s)]
*  All right, go ahead. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2432.72s)]
*  Mr. President, you were saying that Palestinians will live somewhere else safe. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2433.72s)]
*  Where exactly do you want them to live? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2437.72s)]
*  Well, it's not where I want them to live. It's going to be where we ultimately choose as a group. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2440.72s)]
*  And I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Jordan. I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2445.72s)]
*  We may have someplace else, but I think when we finish our talks, we'll have a place where they're going to live very happily and very safely. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2452.72s)]
*  And, you know, don't forget, they only want to be on the Gaza Strip because they don't know anything else. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2461.72s)]
*  They never had an alternative and they don't want to be in the Gaza Strip, but they have no choice. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2467.72s)]
*  They have to be. And they're being killed there at levels that nobody's ever seen. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2472.72s)]
*  No place in the world is like as dangerous as the Gaza Strip. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2476.72s)]
*  They don't want to be there. They have no alternative. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2481.72s)]
*  When they have an alternative, not one person will want to stay where they are. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2483.72s)]
*  Nobody wants to stay there. They're living in hell. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2487.72s)]
*  It's a death trap. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2490.72s)]
*  Mr. President, how do you know that the Palestinians don't want to leave their land? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2492.72s)]
*  Some people say this is ethnic cleansing. You won't be able to force them to leave their land. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2496.72s)]
*  They stay in there. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2501.72s)]
*  We're moving into a beautiful location where they have new homes, where they can live safely, where they'll have doctors and medical. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2502.72s)]
*  And all of those things. And I think it's going to be great. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2510.72s)]
*  Yeah. Any questions? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2513.72s)]
*  King Abdullah, what do you think about the U.S. taking over the Gaza Strip? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2514.72s)]
*  Do you want to see the U.S. own the Gaza Strip? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2517.72s)]
*  Well, I think, as I said earlier, the president is looking at Egypt coming to present their plan. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2520.72s)]
*  As I said, we will be in Saudi Arabia to discuss how we can work with the president and with the United States. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2526.72s)]
*  So I think let's wait until the Egyptians can come and present to the president and not get ahead of ourselves. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2532.72s)]
*  And is there a partial land in Jordan that you're willing to have, Palestinian children? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2538.72s)]
*  Well, I think what we said, I have to look at the best interests of my country. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2541.72s)]
*  I think the president is very happy that we do this thing with 2,000 children as quickly as possible. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2545.72s)]
*  And again, I believe that they're getting a group of us Arabs here to discuss the overall plan. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2550.72s)]
*  And last question, the 2,000 children, are those from the Gaza Strip? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2557.72s)]
*  Absolutely, from the Gaza Strip. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2560.72s)]
*  Are you willing to change your mind, Mr. President? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2562.72s)]
*  That's from the Gaza Strip, the 2,000. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2563.72s)]
*  Are you willing to change your mind if you hear the Egyptian and the Arab plan end of the month? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2566.72s)]
*  If they present you something different, are you all in the relevant plans? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2571.72s)]
*  I think we sort of have gone down the line. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2574.72s)]
*  We know pretty much what is going to be presented. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2577.72s)]
*  And I think it's going to be something that's going to be magnificent for the Palestinians. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2580.72s)]
*  They're going to be in love with it. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2584.72s)]
*  I did very well with real estate. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2587.72s)]
*  I can tell you about real estate. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2589.72s)]
*  They're going to be in love with it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2590.72s)]
*  Mr. President, does it concern you that moving 2 million people from there? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2592.72s)]
*  It's a very small number of people. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2597.72s)]
*  Stop giving a shit. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2599.72s)]
*  Thank you for the 50 give the subs. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2600.72s)]
*  Sorry, I didn't notice it. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2602.72s)]
*  Relative to other things that have taken place over the decades and centuries. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2604.72s)]
*  It's a very small number of people. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2608.72s)]
*  And they're living a terrible life. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2610.72s)]
*  Look at the way they're living now. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2613.72s)]
*  Nobody's... [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2615.72s)]
*  Yeah, they're really going to love being ethnically cleansed from their ancestral lands [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2616.72s)]
*  or what remains of the area that they were initially displaced to. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2622.72s)]
*  They're going to love that. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2628.72s)]
*  They're going to personally prefer that. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2629.72s)]
*  They're going to love that so much. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2631.72s)]
*  Oh, 2 million people he's talking about. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2633.72s)]
*  Forcible ethnic displacement. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2636.72s)]
*  I can't, dude. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2638.72s)]
*  It is so insane. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2640.72s)]
*  By the way, you want to know some that's also kind of interesting about this process. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2642.72s)]
*  This is yet another area where the Democrats are not in unison collectively saying this is genocide. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2647.72s)]
*  Part of that is because they would look incredibly hypocritical if they actually chirped about it, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2654.72s)]
*  considering that they also oversaw the ethnic cleansing of Palestine under their watchful gaze. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2658.72s)]
*  But that's why I think it's ridiculous when liberals come in here to try and defend the Democratic Party [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2664.72s)]
*  when they're not even fucking saying anything about Donald Trump. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2670.72s)]
*  Like, they're not even saying... [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2673.72s)]
*  They're not even doing this. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2676.72s)]
*  They're not doing the thing that you want them... [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2677.72s)]
*  or that you're claiming that they're doing. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2680.72s)]
*  Nobody's living like that in the entire world. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2682.72s)]
*  They're living under buildings that are mostly fallen down and will continue to fall down. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2686.72s)]
*  Bro, these are such horrible takes. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2692.72s)]
*  Lamao. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2694.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2695.72s)]
*  Horrible takes. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2696.72s)]
*  An accurate assessment of the reality that is in front of your eyes is a horrible take [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2697.72s)]
*  because you would rather not recognize what is happening and instead imagine an alternative reality. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2702.72s)]
*  It's always great because these guys have nothing. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2710.72s)]
*  It's like this take, maybe a statement about how I'm a terrorism supporter or something like that, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2714.72s)]
*  which is not even a counterpoint to what I'm saying. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2722.72s)]
*  And then that's it. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2725.72s)]
*  They just leave. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2727.72s)]
*  Like, I'm looking for serious discourse. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2728.72s)]
*  If there's something that you consider I have said that is wrong, present it. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2730.72s)]
*  And they're living under. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2737.72s)]
*  People are being killed every day. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2739.72s)]
*  The conditions are horrible. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2740.72s)]
*  There are no conditions anywhere in the world that are worse than the Gaza Strip right now. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2742.72s)]
*  But don't you have... [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2747.72s)]
*  Mr. President, you said all hell will break out if all the hostages are not released on Saturday. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2748.72s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2753.72s)]
*  And are you encouraging Netanyahu to walk away from this deal? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2754.72s)]
*  Have you talked about this with him? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2757.72s)]
*  So I've looked at what... [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2758.72s)]
*  At the condition of people coming out of the hostage situation, and it's horrible. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2760.72s)]
*  I looked at the before and after yesterday. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2766.72s)]
*  Three young men. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2770.72s)]
*  One is dead now, as you know. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2772.72s)]
*  The older gentleman who died, which everybody said he was alive and well. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2774.72s)]
*  He's dead. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2778.72s)]
*  But the three young men. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2780.72s)]
*  And I looked at them from a short while ago, and I look at them now. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2782.72s)]
*  They are emaciated. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2786.72s)]
*  They look like Holocaust survivors. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2787.72s)]
*  They looked... [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2790.72s)]
*  I mean, they'll get better. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2792.72s)]
*  But they're in rough shape. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2794.72s)]
*  They were treated really badly, and we've heard things from them since. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2796.72s)]
*  And I think the reason that Hamas is playing so cute is because they probably... [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2801.72s)]
*  They saw the reaction to these three people that came out. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2808.72s)]
*  And the other was, look, the one young lady had her hand blown off, practically. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2811.72s)]
*  And they were not in great shape either. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2815.72s)]
*  But she's missing her fingers and a big part of her hand. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2819.72s)]
*  You know what she did? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2822.72s)]
*  She was stopping a bullet that was aimed at her. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2823.72s)]
*  She went like that, and it blew off her hand. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2826.72s)]
*  Now, I think what they're... [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2830.72s)]
*  I think they want time because I think the people that they have living are in such bad shape. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2833.72s)]
*  Because they're sending the most healthy people out. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2837.72s)]
*  Because they don't want to send the least healthy. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2840.72s)]
*  There was an uproar when they saw the people from yesterday. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2842.72s)]
*  So these people are... [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2846.72s)]
*  So I don't want to do two, and then we do another two in another week, and then we do four in three weeks. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2848.72s)]
*  No, they either have them out by Saturday at 12 o'clock or... [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2854.72s)]
*  Looks like you read my message and was like, my head's going to explode. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2859.72s)]
*  What is the difference between liberal and leftist? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2863.72s)]
*  I thought it was one and the same. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2864.72s)]
*  What am I? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2866.72s)]
*  Liberals inherently want to defend capitalism. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2867.72s)]
*  Their worldview revolves around the protection of private property. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2871.72s)]
*  Leftists can be broadly categorized as a collection of people whose political ideology starts at anti-capitalism. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2875.72s)]
*  That's the biggest difference. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2886.72s)]
*  In the United States of America, I would consider even social democrats who are also capitalists. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2888.72s)]
*  To be a part of the broader left coalition because of the current political... [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2895.72s)]
*  The current material conditions in the United States of America and the broader political goals. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2903.72s)]
*  Any kind of socialization initiative or any kind of expansion of the welfare state would still be somewhat leftist. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2912.72s)]
*  Any kind of pro-labor initiative would still be broadly defined as a leftist position. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2922.72s)]
*  At least those are my standards for it, and other people will disagree with me and say, no, social democrats are not a part of the left movement. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2929.72s)]
*  This is, of course, mostly for American politics, which is, unfortunately, one of the most right-wing nations on the planet, at least economically. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2937.72s)]
*  All bets are off. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2948.72s)]
*  Mr. President, would you still consider withholding aid to those countries if they don't accept your plans to accept... [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2950.72s)]
*  Well, I don't want to say that because we've had such a good relationship and we're doing so well just in the short time that we've been talking. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2957.72s)]
*  I mean, the King just made a statement. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2964.72s)]
*  I didn't ask him to do that about literally saving 2,000 young children from the Gaza Strip. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2968.72s)]
*  We didn't know about that. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2977.72s)]
*  You didn't know about that. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2978.72s)]
*  Nobody did except for the King and his son. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2979.72s)]
*  I assume you told your son, right? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2982.72s)]
*  And I just thought it was great. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2984.72s)]
*  No, I think we'll do something. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2986.72s)]
*  I don't have to threaten with money. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2988.72s)]
*  We do. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2990.72s)]
*  We contribute a lot of money to Jordan and to Egypt, by the way. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2991.72s)]
*  A lot. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2994.72s)]
*  To both. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2995.72s)]
*  But I don't have to threaten that. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2996.72s)]
*  I don't think... [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2998.72s)]
*  I think we're above that. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=2999.72s)]
*  I do believe we're above that. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3000.72s)]
*  Would you consider other countries, not Jordan and Egypt, there was talks about Indonesia, Albania, other places? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3002.72s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3008.72s)]
*  And we have other countries that want to get involved. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3009.72s)]
*  We have a lot of people that want to get involved. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3013.72s)]
*  There's a great sense of wanting to help the Palestinians. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3015.72s)]
*  They really... [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3020.72s)]
*  There's a lot of good countries out there, people that rule those countries with big hearts. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3021.72s)]
*  And this gentleman is at the top of the list. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3026.72s)]
*  And if they don't want to leave, how are you going to force them, Mr. President? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3028.72s)]
*  Oh, they're going to be great. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3032.72s)]
*  They're going to be very happy. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3033.72s)]
*  Your Majesty, should we expect that the Jordanian response would be part of a coordinated Arab response? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3035.72s)]
*  The response will be from a multitude of countries, Arab, international. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3042.72s)]
*  I know the Europeans. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3048.72s)]
*  And again, we'll probably have to look to the help of the United States to make sure that Kogat, which is the clearing agency on the Israeli side... [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3049.72s)]
*  There's really nothing eloquent to say anymore in the face of the most vulgar, unabashed fascism we've seen so far. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3056.72s)]
*  Even for me, it's tough to find context or historical parallels these days. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3061.72s)]
*  I mean, the context is obvious. It's Hitler. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3064.72s)]
*  It feels like there's nothing left to do but scream whatever air we have left in our lungs. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3066.72s)]
*  I and many others said from the start the deal wouldn't last, but it doesn't stop this from hitting like a truck. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3070.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's just we're walking through the different stages of early Hitler to late Hitler. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3075.72s)]
*  I must be racist. I thought the king would have a wild accent. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3082.72s)]
*  No, he was... [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3086.72s)]
*  He literally is... [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3087.72s)]
*  He's basically British. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3089.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3091.72s)]
*  ...makes it as efficient as possible because 2,000 kids, the best way to get to them is by helicopters and get them straight to our institutions. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3092.72s)]
*  I also believe that quite a few countries would also probably like to take some of those kids and have them treated in their hospitals. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3100.72s)]
*  So we hope to launch this ASAP. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3106.72s)]
*  Yes, and that's right. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3108.72s)]
*  This should have been done by the Biden administration, but, you know, they didn't do anything. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3109.72s)]
*  They didn't know what the hell they were doing. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3113.72s)]
*  So this should have been done by the Biden administration. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3114.72s)]
*  This should have never happened because October 7th would have never happened. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3117.72s)]
*  If I were president, zero chance of happening. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3121.72s)]
*  You wouldn't have had that whole mess where the Middle East got blown up and you wouldn't have had Ukraine and Russia fighting. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3124.72s)]
*  That would have never happened. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3131.72s)]
*  And by the way, we're making good progress there, I think. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3133.72s)]
*  I really think we're making some very good progress. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3136.72s)]
*  Mr. President, you said before that the U.S. would buy Gaza, and today you just said we're not going to buy Gaza. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3138.72s)]
*  We're not going to have to buy. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3145.72s)]
*  We're going to have Gaza. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3146.72s)]
*  We don't have to buy. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3148.72s)]
*  There's nothing to buy. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3149.72s)]
*  We will have Gaza. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3150.72s)]
*  What is that? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3153.72s)]
*  No reason to buy. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3154.72s)]
*  There is nothing to buy. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3155.72s)]
*  It's Gaza. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3156.72s)]
*  It's a war-torn area. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3157.72s)]
*  We're going to take it. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3159.72s)]
*  We're going to hold it. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3160.72s)]
*  We're going to cherish it. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3161.72s)]
*  We're going to get it going eventually, where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3162.72s)]
*  It's going to be for the people in the Middle East. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3170.72s)]
*  But I think it can be a diamond. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3172.72s)]
*  It can be an absolute tremendous asset for the Middle East. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3173.72s)]
*  And you're going to have peace. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3177.72s)]
*  It's going to bring peace in the Middle East. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3179.72s)]
*  Gaza the way it is right now, every 10 years you're going to have the same thing happening. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3180.72s)]
*  I've watched it so long. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3185.72s)]
*  All the death and destruction of Gaza. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3186.72s)]
*  The civilization has been wiped out in Gaza. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3189.72s)]
*  Now, it's going to be a tremendous thing. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3192.72s)]
*  It's fronting on the sea. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3195.72s)]
*  It's going to be a great economic development job. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3198.72s)]
*  It's going to put people to work, a lot of people to work. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3200.72s)]
*  And those people are all going to be from the Middle East. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3203.72s)]
*  And just to follow up with one on that for King Abdullah, can you clarify again, sir, how do you feel about the U.S. taking Gaza, as the president said? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3205.72s)]
*  Well, again, this is something that we as Arabs will be coming to the United States with something that we're going to talk about later to discuss all these options. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3216.72s)]
*  And Mr. President, take it under what authority? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3227.72s)]
*  It is sovereignty. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3229.72s)]
*  Under the U.S. authority. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3230.72s)]
*  And Mr. President, would you seek to personally develop property in Gaza after this happens? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3232.72s)]
*  No, no, I've had a great career in real estate. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3236.72s)]
*  Mr. President, what are your team? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3239.72s)]
*  You know, when you've done what I've done in the last number of years, including the four years that we should have been doing something else, frankly, because people see that now for sure. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3241.72s)]
*  But when you've done what I've done, you can just do more good for people when you're president. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3252.72s)]
*  When you're president, we can do things. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3259.72s)]
*  This is all things that should have been done, but actually things that shouldn't have had to be done. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3261.72s)]
*  Gaza, absolutely, it would have been it would have been so great if the Biden administration would have started this. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3266.72s)]
*  But actually, in all fairness to them, it was they should have never let it happen. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3273.72s)]
*  It did happen. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3280.72s)]
*  And because of the fact that they let this happen, this catastrophe of October 7th, something like this becomes practical and very real, meaning the development and all of the things that I've talked about with respect to the Gaza Strip. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3281.72s)]
*  If you didn't have the October 7th catastrophe and it was a horrible catastrophe, then probably you wouldn't be talking about that. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3296.72s)]
*  But the only thing I can say is this is going to bring stability and peace to the Middle East. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3304.72s)]
*  And ultimately, when it's developed, which will be in quite a while from now, is when things calm down. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3310.72s)]
*  But when it's developed, it's going to bring tremendous numbers of jobs to the Middle East, including people of your country. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3318.72s)]
*  What if it does not bring peace to the Middle East? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3325.72s)]
*  There are many Palestinians, even though you say that everything is going to be beautiful, everything is going to be lovely, they're not going to want to go back. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3329.72s)]
*  There are going to be people who want to go back and feel like it is their right to do that. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3334.72s)]
*  You haven't said, well, there'll be any type of repercussions or anything that happens. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3338.72s)]
*  We don't think that's going to happen. We think it's going to. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3342.72s)]
*  We think people are going to be very happy, thrilled. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3344.72s)]
*  A lot of those people that you talk about. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3346.72s)]
*  Oh, that's great. No, no, no. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3348.72s)]
*  As long as you keep saying over and over again that people are going to be very happy, then that's great. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3349.72s)]
*  Okay, got it. Yeah. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3357.72s)]
*  Two million Palestinians forcibly removed. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3359.72s)]
*  What happens when people don't want to leave? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3361.72s)]
*  What do you do then? Oh, they'll just be happy. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3364.72s)]
*  They'll leave. Then they ask, how will this process occur without US military presence? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3367.72s)]
*  He says, Oh, Israel will take care of it. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3373.72s)]
*  We're going to end up maybe living there and maybe working there, but it'll be in a different form. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3375.72s)]
*  We have had tremendous support for this project and we think the biggest asset of the project is going to bring peace ultimately to the Middle East. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3382.72s)]
*  All right. One last question. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3392.72s)]
*  Go ahead. You've asked enough. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3394.72s)]
*  Mr. President, one of your promises on the campaign trail is to bring peace to the Middle East. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3396.72s)]
*  It was a voter, Arab voters here. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3401.72s)]
*  The Arab voters in the United States oppose this. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3404.72s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3408.72s)]
*  Well, you know, if you look at Michigan, where we have a large Arab population, as you know, I was just telling the king that we won. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3409.72s)]
*  As you know, I won the Arab population. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3417.72s)]
*  And when I started off, I wasn't leading. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3419.72s)]
*  When I finished a few months later, we started campaigning in Michigan. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3421.72s)]
*  And when I finished, we won it by a tremendous amount, by 30 points. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3426.72s)]
*  So my relationship with the Arab population has been fantastic. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3433.72s)]
*  And I mean, it's just every part of this is delusional. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3438.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3441.72s)]
*  With the state, it's just everything he's saying is completely delusional. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3443.72s)]
*  It's just as delusional to say, oh, the Arab population loves me, as is to say that like the Palestinians will love being forcibly removed at gunpoint from what remains of their ancestral lands. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3447.72s)]
*  OK. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3462.72s)]
*  Police firing Gaza hanging by a thread. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3463.72s)]
*  The King of Jordan came to the White House today for urgent talks with Donald Trump as the president reiterated his ultimatum to Hamas that they have until noon on Saturday to return the hostages or else. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3465.72s)]
*  They either have them out by Saturday at 12 o'clock or all bets are off. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3479.72s)]
*  Was he talking about American retaliation? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3485.72s)]
*  The president didn't say, but the threat was clearly there and clearly echoed by Israel's prime minister today. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3488.72s)]
*  If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end and the army will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3496.72s)]
*  The joint ultimatums came after Hamas last night said it would delay the release of hostages from Gaza this weekend, claiming Israel had broken promises in their ceasefire deal. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3508.72s)]
*  Yeah, Israel did break the promises in the ceasefire deal. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3520.72s)]
*  This is trackable stuff, stuff that Israeli authorities have also agreed to. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3524.72s)]
*  The Israeli military has said Hamas has not violated the ceasefire conditions. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3530.72s)]
*  Negotiators that wanted to maintain anonymity, of course, have openly confirmed that Israel was the violator of the ceasefire agreements, specifically violating some of the agreements such as how many aid trucks were to be let into the Gaza Strip. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3535.72s)]
*  How many mobile homes were to be brought into the Gaza Strip? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3555.72s)]
*  Israel brought in zero. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3560.72s)]
*  They were supposed to send in 50 trucks with oil. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3562.72s)]
*  They've only sent 15 every day. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3566.72s)]
*  They were supposed to send in 200,000 mobile homes they've sent in zero. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3569.72s)]
*  They were supposed to or wait, hold on. I don't want to get the numbers completely wrong here. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3575.72s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3582.72s)]
*  Oh God, I have the fucking Macklemore video right here. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3584.72s)]
*  It was 200,000 tents. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3587.72s)]
*  They were supposed to send in. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3588.72s)]
*  They've only spent they've only sent in what a hundred and or twenty thousand. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3590.72s)]
*  I know the number of mobile homes they sent in is zero, but I don't remember what the actual number was for. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3595.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3603.72s)]
*  Entry of 50 fuel trucks per day. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3604.72s)]
*  Fewer than 25 trucks were allowed represented representing less than 50 percent of the agreed quantity. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3606.72s)]
*  Commercial sector was not allowed to import fuel. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3612.72s)]
*  The agreed quantity of tents allowed entry was 53,000 out of the 200,000 tents specified zero caravan caravans were allowed in even though 60,000 were needed. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3615.72s)]
*  No construction materials to rebuild the hospitals were sent in the entry of heavy machinery for debris removal, street opening and the retrieval of martyrs bodies was blocked. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3628.72s)]
*  Four machines were allowed in the enclave needed 500 heavy machines of all types. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3636.72s)]
*  It's laughable. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3642.72s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3643.72s)]
*  And it's something that the Israeli government has openly admitted to as well. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3644.72s)]
*  Humanitarian aid wasn't flowing and Palestinians were being prevented from returning to the north of the strip. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3649.72s)]
*  But President Trump wasn't buying it. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3656.72s)]
*  And you know, I have a Saturday. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3658.72s)]
*  We are making a mistake. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3660.72s)]
*  Every time we bring things back to him, he gains relevancy. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3661.72s)]
*  Relevancy is power. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3664.72s)]
*  Those who are hungry fear irrelevance. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3666.72s)]
*  Share this message. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3669.72s)]
*  Yeah, we are collectively going to ignore the genocide there. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3671.72s)]
*  President of the United States of America, as he's actively talking about the steps that he's going to take to do a permanent ethnic cleansing campaign. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3675.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3685.72s)]
*  Deadline. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3686.72s)]
*  And I don't think they're going to make the deadline personally. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3687.72s)]
*  I think they they want to play tough guy, but we'll see how tough they are. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3689.72s)]
*  Trump says he wants to bring peace to the Middle East, but his plan to take over Gaza and his threats to Hamas have instead brought chaos to the peace process. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3695.72s)]
*  But he insists things are on track and today is hoping to strong arm the King of Jordan to take some of the nearly two million Palestinians he plans to remove from Gaza as part of his real estate makeover. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3704.72s)]
*  I want them to live. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3718.72s)]
*  It's going to be where we ultimately choose as a group. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3719.72s)]
*  And I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Jordan. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3722.72s)]
*  I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3726.72s)]
*  We may have someplace else, but I think when we finish our talks, we'll have a place where they're going to live very happily and very safely. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3729.72s)]
*  But the King of Jordan wouldn't commit to Trump's plan, though he hoped to appease the president with one concession. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3738.72s)]
*  One of the things that we can do right away is take 2000 children that are either cancer children or in very ill state to Jordan as quickly as possible and then wait for, I think, the Egyptians to present their plan on how we can work with the president to work on Gaza challenges. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3745.72s)]
*  Amid the back and forth, politicians on the Hill didn't appear to understand what Trump's threat meant that all hell would break out if Hamas didn't comply with his demands. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3765.72s)]
*  What does all hell will break out mean, though? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3776.72s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3779.72s)]
*  That's a question for President Trump. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3780.72s)]
*  Is he talking about American boots on the ground, though? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3782.72s)]
*  That's a question for President Trump. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3785.72s)]
*  Would you support that? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3787.72s)]
*  No, I would not. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3788.72s)]
*  This Republican senator was a very rare politician who dared be critical of the president's latest threats. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3790.72s)]
*  President Trump's ultimatum on Gaza yesterday to Hamas. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3797.72s)]
*  Is that helpful? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3801.72s)]
*  Do you support that? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3802.72s)]
*  And what does he mean by all hell breaking out? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3803.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3805.72s)]
*  I think that's a question that is clearly best directed to President Trump. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3806.72s)]
*  And his view to take over Gaza? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3813.72s)]
*  Obviously, the King of Jordan is here today to persuade them to take millions, two million Palestinians. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3816.72s)]
*  Dude, the British are not aware of the ways in which the ways in which concern gets thrown around. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3822.72s)]
*  OK. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3831.72s)]
*  It's like, wow, we found a Republican senator who is she is very concerned. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3832.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3839.72s)]
*  Is that a proposition that you think can work? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3841.72s)]
*  My guess is that it is not going to be welcomed. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3845.72s)]
*  How? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3850.72s)]
*  How is it possible for them to do? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3851.72s)]
*  And so it may be very easy to say somebody else will just take these people. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3853.72s)]
*  Easier said than done. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3860.72s)]
*  So I think the response today is going to be very important. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3861.72s)]
*  The response from Jordan today seems to be, we hear you, President Trump, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3865.72s)]
*  but we're not ready to commit to your real estate deal just yet. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3870.72s)]
*  It's a war torn area. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3874.72s)]
*  We're going to take it. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3876.72s)]
*  We're going to hold it. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3877.72s)]
*  We're going to cherish it. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3878.72s)]
*  But President Trump seems determined to make his Gaza plan happen regardless. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3879.72s)]
*  Shabon Kennedy reporting from Washington. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3885.72s)]
*  Well, Jordan has already absorbed waves of Palestinian refugees. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3888.72s)]
*  Almost two and a half million people are registered as such with the United Nations. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3891.72s)]
*  But if Jordan and Egypt were to suddenly take in millions of displaced Gazans, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3896.72s)]
*  it would put decades of relative stability at significant risk, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3900.72s)]
*  as our international editor, Lindsay Hilsum, now reports. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3904.72s)]
*  On the streets of the Jordanian capital today, lawyers... [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3908.72s)]
*  First time chatter, had to follow to ask this question. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3912.72s)]
*  How does Trump and his Gaza plan get any traction? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3914.72s)]
*  Don't Palestinians have some sort of form of government to negotiate or disagree? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3916.72s)]
*  No. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3919.72s)]
*  They have been deliberately undermined and written out of this process, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3920.72s)]
*  which is ironically how October 7 happened to begin with, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3923.72s)]
*  and that they're not even seen as human beings in the eyes of Donald Trump or Benjamin Netanyahu. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3927.72s)]
*  They're not even seen as people. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3932.72s)]
*  They quite literally refer to them as subhuman. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3934.72s)]
*  How else would you be able to actively state... [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3939.72s)]
*  How else would you be able to actively state that you are going to do a mass ethnic [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3944.72s)]
*  displacement campaign of two million people, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3950.72s)]
*  and you don't even hear what they have to say about it? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3954.72s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3957.72s)]
*  You can only make this... [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3958.72s)]
*  You can only advocate for something like this if you just don't think that they're human beings. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3959.72s)]
*  The lawyers were protesting that the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3963.72s)]
*  would be against international law, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3968.72s)]
*  and they were trying to give President Trump a history lesson. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3971.72s)]
*  The dream of displacing the Palestinian people goes back a hundred years. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3975.72s)]
*  It has never and will never be fulfilled because of their heroism. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3979.72s)]
*  The scene is near Jericho, one of the camps for Arab refugees. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3983.72s)]
*  The story is one of destitution. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3990.72s)]
*  The US President may be unfamiliar with or unbothered by what happened in 1948, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3992.72s)]
*  when the founding of the State of Israel forced more than half a million Palestinians into Jordan. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=3999.72s)]
*  He may not remember the war in 1967, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4005.72s)]
*  when another 300,000 or so fled to the Hashemite kingdom, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4009.72s)]
*  so Palestinians became a majority in the country, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4014.72s)]
*  nor the instability that the exodus caused in Jordan. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4017.72s)]
*  That was mortar. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4029.72s)]
*  That was a mortar right in the front garden. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4030.72s)]
*  In 1970, in what became known as Black September, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4033.72s)]
*  Jordanian forces ended up fighting the Palestinian Liberation Organization, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4037.72s)]
*  which was trying to topple King Hussein, the current Jordanian king's father. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4042.72s)]
*  Well, I think Jordan and Egypt... [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4047.72s)]
*  This is also part of the reason why the Jordanian people were so angry [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4049.72s)]
*  about the Jordanian king being terrified of a mass influx of Palestinian refugees coming into the country, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4055.72s)]
*  especially considering how many of Jordan are technically Palestinian to begin with. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4067.72s)]
*  But the reason for the existence of the nation state of Jordan, or the monarch to exist, is basically this. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4073.72s)]
*  Well, I know they've spoken about it with you, and they say they're not going to accept. I say they will. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4081.72s)]
*  Will they? Knowing that accepting so many refugees might lead to the downfall of their own leadership? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4087.72s)]
*  This takes us back to the 50s and 60s, even 70s, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4094.72s)]
*  when Palestinian movements were trying to fight to get back to their homes. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4098.719999999999s)]
*  So it would destabilize these countries, their neighbors, the region, politically, economically, in security terms. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4104.72s)]
*  It's not even worth... [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4111.72s)]
*  Hello, Hassan. Obviously, the plan to relocate all those people is ridiculous, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4112.72s)]
*  but considering the current political climate, do you think it's maybe the only option to stop the killing? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4115.72s)]
*  There is no relocation of two million Palestinians without killing a big chunk of them. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4119.72s)]
*  I don't understand the liberal mind that is so subservient to ethnic cleansing. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4123.72s)]
*  Hello, Hassan. Obviously, the plan to relocate all of those indigenous Native Americans throughout West is ridiculous, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4130.72s)]
*  but considering the current political climate, don't you think it's maybe the only option to stop the ethnic cleansing campaign? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4138.72s)]
*  Hello, Hassan. Obviously, the plan to relocate all of those Jews in Germany and all of the additional territories that Germany is taking over for Liebensraum purposes is somewhat ridiculous. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4144.72s)]
*  But don't you think considering the current political climate that it's maybe the only option to stop the killing? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4156.72s)]
*  That's it. This isn't even like, oh, you're calling everything Nazi or you're calling everything a genocide style situation. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4161.72s)]
*  This is directly it. History is unfolding in front of our eyes. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4170.72s)]
*  And there are people who actively are assuming the role of the genocide heirs, finding reasons as to why it's logical. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4180.72s)]
*  Worth bearing think about the consequences of such a move. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4188.72s)]
*  Yesterday, the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was meeting his Egyptian counterpart, Bader Abdel-Ati, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4193.72s)]
*  who is also likely to have resisted the idea of accepting Palestinian refugees. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4200.72s)]
*  Since the ceasefire, it's become clear that Hamas is still active in Gaza. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4206.72s)]
*  The movement has its roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian government's most potent domestic enemy. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4212.72s)]
*  They would surely fear Hamas fighters infiltrating Egypt, quite apart from the fury of their own population about the forced displacement of Palestinians. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4219.72s)]
*  Across the Arab world, should Gaza be ethnically cleansed? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4229.72s)]
*  Should many more, tens of thousands of Palestinians be killed? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4233.72s)]
*  The anger on the streets and just how much of the world will hold Egypt and Jordan complicit in an ethnic cleansing of Gaza? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4238.72s)]
*  This is something that they very much fear. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4248.72s)]
*  President Trump is, of course, right. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4251.72s)]
*  Gaza is largely uninhabitable. It will take decades and billions of dollars to rebuild. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4254.72s)]
*  It is unsustainable to expect people to live indefinitely in rubble. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4260.72s)]
*  Israel and regional powers need to find a solution. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4265.72s)]
*  But the history of the Middle East is a tale of outside interference and internal strife, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4268.72s)]
*  where a violent, tragic past is only too often a guide to the future. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4274.72s)]
*  Lindsay Hilton reporting. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4280.72s)]
*  Fleur Hassan Ahoum is an Israeli Foreign Ministry special envoy and previously served as deputy mayor of Jerusalem. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4282.72s)]
*  She joins me now from that city. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4288.72s)]
*  Thanks for coming back on the program. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4290.72s)]
*  Let's start with the ceasefire deal, if I may. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4292.72s)]
*  I mean, from what the president has been saying in Washington, from what your prime minister has been saying, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4294.72s)]
*  it looks as if the deal might be doomed by this Saturday at noon. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4298.72s)]
*  Yes, it's very concerning because, of course, as you saw last Saturday, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4303.72s)]
*  when the three hostages came out looking like Holocaust survivors, you know, at this point, everybody's a humanitarian case. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4307.72s)]
*  Anybody who's alive is not in good condition. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4313.72s)]
*  And in fact, there's a lot of within Israel, there's a lot of debate as to whether we should have had the first phase and the second phase to begin with. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4316.72s)]
*  Why are we drip releasing? Why are Hamas drip releasing these hostages? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4323.72s)]
*  And why did we agree to this? It was almost extortion. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4328.72s)]
*  But this was a deal that was agreed to by all sides. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4331.72s)]
*  This is the other that's been complied to so far until now. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4334.72s)]
*  I must say that Israel is breaking the deal by not allowing enough fuel trucks in instead of 50 fuel trucks a day. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4338.72s)]
*  They've only allowed in 15 instead of 200,000 tents that only allowed 20,000 tents. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4345.72s)]
*  And one gets the impression that Israel, by doing that, Hamas would say, doesn't actually want the Gaza Strip to be rebuilt in any shape or form. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4350.72s)]
*  First of all, it's a lie that Israel is not. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4359.72s)]
*  Why would a mosque stick with the deal? This can become a major blunder for Trump because they're desperate. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4362.72s)]
*  What do you mean? Like they have they have stuck with the deal. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4368.72s)]
*  Hamas is stuck with the deal. Israel confirmed that Hamas is stuck with the deal. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4373.72s)]
*  This person is simply talking shit, not complying with with the deal, with the ceasefire. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4378.72s)]
*  And now we know that because the UN, who can be very critical of Israel, have said today that it's not true. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4384.72s)]
*  No, they didn't. What? What is she talking about? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4390.72s)]
*  Israel itself, negotiators on the Israeli side have openly admitted that they are not abiding by the the current ceasefire agreements. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4394.72s)]
*  This is before we even talk about the bombing campaigns and the shooting that Israel is engaged in inside of Gaza, which is a direct violation of still it is to begin with. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4408.72s)]
*  Genuine question. Why is stopping Hamas from releasing? What is stopping Hamas from releasing all the hostages? Is it leverage? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4418.72s)]
*  It doesn't seem like Israel even cares anymore. So what's the upside? Yeah, that's literally it. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4424.72s)]
*  That's always been the case. What are you talking about? What? Yes, of course, it's leverage chatter. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4428.72s)]
*  A crumb of leverage. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4434.72s)]
*  All the humanitarian aid that's supposed to go in is going in. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4437.72s)]
*  And so they're fabricating a crisis like they've done before. Let's be honest. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4440.72s)]
*  October 6th, we also had a ceasefire with Hamas in twenty twenty three last year over a year ago when we had a hundred hostages come out. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4444.72s)]
*  We also had a deal with some of us that they broke. So they are the ones who keep. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4452.72s)]
*  Oh, they're the ones who keep breaking it. Not Israel, even though Israel is the one who very actively violates the agreements, including in this one as well. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4455.72s)]
*  Breaking these ceasefire deals and inventing excuses. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4462.72s)]
*  I just wondered if I could ask you. Yeah. Ask him what Hamas is violated so far. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4465.72s)]
*  That's what I would like to know. What is Hamas violated in terms of the ceasefire agreement? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4471.72s)]
*  They literally played ball. First, they released the hostages and there was commotion. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4476.72s)]
*  Then they released the hostages in an orderly manner on a stage. Right. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4481.72s)]
*  But Israel hated that because the hostages were throwing up peace signs. OK. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4487.72s)]
*  So they fucking hated that. And they told Hamas never to do that again. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4491.72s)]
*  So they went back to releasing hostages in the public crowds. OK. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4495.72s)]
*  And then Israel was like, look at how they're mistreating our hostages when they're releasing them. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4501.72s)]
*  So they went back to the fucking podium again. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4505.72s)]
*  There's no there's no correct way to do this in the eyes of Israel, because the problem is the hostages that have been released [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4508.72s)]
*  overall, the hostages that have been released overall, look to be in much better conditions in spite of the fact that they were under a blockade [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4515.72s)]
*  implemented by Israel, under bombings implemented by Israel. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4524.72s)]
*  Then the Palestinian hostages that have been released from Israeli detention. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4528.72s)]
*  Who were very clearly tortured by the thousands. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4533.72s)]
*  About the bigger picture, and this is what President Trump raised again in the Oval Office, talking to King Abdullah of Jordan. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4538.72s)]
*  This idea that a million Gazans would be moved, one assumes forcibly because none of them probably want to go to Jordan and a million to Egypt. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4545.72s)]
*  I mean, is that do you think that's a good idea? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4555.72s)]
*  Well, why do you assume they wouldn't want to go? Because it's their home. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4558.72s)]
*  No, they would love to go. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4563.72s)]
*  But if it's unlivable right now and there's been a lot of unofficial research, first of all, let's look at numbers of the 10 years before October 7th, 250,000 Gazans, the ones who could get out because Hamas would not let them leave. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4565.72s)]
*  The ones who could get out had a bit of money to get themselves smuggled out left since October 7th, the rich ones who could get out 100,000 are in Egypt right now. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4578.72s)]
*  So why don't we do something which nobody actually wants to do, which is ask the Gazans. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4588.72s)]
*  Maybe they don't want to be cannon fodder for Hamas. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4592.72s)]
*  But do you think it's a good idea, just whether they want to leave or not, do you think it's a good idea for 2 million Gazans to be moved to Egypt and Jordan? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4595.72s)]
*  I think it's a good idea to ask the Gazans what they want. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4604.72s)]
*  Do they want to be ruled by terrorists or do they want a chance at peace and prosperity somewhere else? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4608.72s)]
*  And if they say we want to stay in Gaza, would Israel listen to them? Should America listen to them? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4613.72s)]
*  Well, I think that we have to ask them first from what I understand, many, at least half would actually leave for a better life. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4619.72s)]
*  What do you want a better life for your family than living in rubble and tents now for the next five to 10 years? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4625.72s)]
*  And I mean, we know from Jordanian officials and Egyptian officials that they don't necessarily welcome the idea of having a million Palestinian refugees on their home soil because it's destabilized their countries in the past. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4631.72s)]
*  Do you think that that might repeat itself? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4643.72s)]
*  Well, it's interesting how you call them refugees. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4645.72s)]
*  And then at the same time, everybody's talking about having them lead their land. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4647.72s)]
*  So is it their land or are they refugees? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4650.72s)]
*  Well, there would be refugees if they went to Jordan. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4652.72s)]
*  There would be refugees if they arrived in Jordan or in Egypt. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4654.72s)]
*  There have been called refugees by UNRWA since 1949. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4658.72s)]
*  Yeah, so they're fake. They're not real refugees. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4662.72s)]
*  Because that would require recognizing that Israel has made them permanent refugees. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4666.72s)]
*  So there's always that debate. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4671.72s)]
*  That's not a debate. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4672.72s)]
*  The debate I'm trying to have with you is whether you think that... [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4673.72s)]
*  You're defending the nation state that did that. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4675.72s)]
*  There's no debate there. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4677.72s)]
*  I guess you could debate everything. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4678.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4680.72s)]
*  It's akin to genocide denial. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4681.72s)]
*  By having a million Palestinians from Gaza living in those two countries would be so destabilizing for those countries, but also ultimately that it might endanger the peace deals that you, Israel, have with Cairo and Daman. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4683.72s)]
*  It's a good point. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4699.72s)]
*  But what I would say is it depends who moves. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4700.72s)]
*  If just regular families who are not involved in terrorism are moving, then why should there be a threat to anyone? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4702.72s)]
*  The problem is, are the Muslim Brotherhood going to move from Gaza to Egypt? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4707.72s)]
*  I can understand the Egyptians. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4712.72s)]
*  I can understand the Jordanians. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4713.72s)]
*  But if it's regular families who want a new life, Jordan has 80 percent, if not 85 percent, Palestinians already. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4714.72s)]
*  In fact, the leader of the opposition of Jordan has said the Palestinians should come to us because this is their land under their own national law. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4723.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4730.72s)]
*  So the Palestinians from Gaza that we've spoken to in recent weeks and months, when presented with this idea, they said, although the place is now a pile of rubble, this is our home. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4731.72s)]
*  This is where we want to stay. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4741.72s)]
*  So if they are forced to move, wouldn't that be ethnic cleansing? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4743.72s)]
*  Well, again, I don't know who you've spoken to. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4748.72s)]
*  What do you that's just definitionally what this is. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4751.72s)]
*  There is no debate on this. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4755.72s)]
*  OK, that is not that like legality matters here. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4756.72s)]
*  OK, because even the international courts are going to be held up every step of the way. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4761.72s)]
*  There is no real justice. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4769.72s)]
*  America dominates all of that. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4771.72s)]
*  That is precisely what this is. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4774.72s)]
*  And your advocacy for this makes you a Nazi. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4777.72s)]
*  I don't understand how you can claim anything other than that. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4780.72s)]
*  That's it. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4785.72s)]
*  You're actively you're actively advocating for the ethnic displacement of a entire group of people that live in their indigenous homeland. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4786.72s)]
*  I've received many, many messages, many, many videos, many families who want to leave just as we've seen. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4797.72s)]
*  Yeah, they're they're all hitting her up. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4804.72s)]
*  The person who works with the Israeli foreign minister and over the last 10 years of people leaving when given the opportunity. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4806.72s)]
*  And maybe there could be more opportunities. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4813.72s)]
*  And the irony, of course, is that like, yeah, I'm sure there's plenty of people who would want to leave right now, especially considering what Israel has done to them. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4815.72s)]
*  OK. And yet there is still a massive. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4824.72s)]
*  A massive. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4829.72s)]
*  Number of Palestinians that will want to stay behind. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4830.72s)]
*  Like, what are you going to do with the massive number of Palestinians out of the two million that don't want to leave? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4834.72s)]
*  How are you going to force them to leave? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4841.72s)]
*  From countries and not just Jordan and Egypt, which I think also President Trump spoke about it. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4843.72s)]
*  Israel has never said it's going to forcibly remove anyone. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4847.72s)]
*  We just want to give people a choice. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4850.72s)]
*  Fleur has a home. Thank you very much. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4852.72s)]
*  She's not trying to give people a choice. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4854.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvpKVTuEiM&t=4859.72s)]
