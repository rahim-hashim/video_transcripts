*  not been deterred by strikes in the Biden era and won't be beaten by air power alone. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=44.4s)]

*  A decade of genocide and famine induced by American backed Saudi coalition forces, UAE [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=66.44s)]

*  the American bombing campaign Operation Prosperity Guardian did not stop them from consistently [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=84.76s)]

*  OK, they have not stopped and they still haven't stopped. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=98.0s)]
*  By the way, this past week, 12 days of consistent bombing every single day in Yemen, as they [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=101.84s)]

*  The bombshell publication of a group chat, blah, blah, blah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=114.6s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether it's now or several weeks from now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  High level hopes in the signal chat, which became public after the Atlanta Shiva. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=119.11999999999999s)]

*  based in London. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=202.72s)]

*  into a larger regional escalation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=204.56s)]
*  And by God, we're going to give them that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=206.64s)]
*  OK, not just New York Times Jewish insider VPs reluctance to support Houthi strikes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=208.68s)]
*  concern some leading GOP senators. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=215.76s)]

*  Vance's. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Vance's. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=225.84s)]
*  Push back against the Houthi strikes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=228.0s)]
*  Hell yeah, dude. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=231.4s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  This morning, Josh Krausher ran a hit piece against me and Jewish insider, which has [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=235.68s)]
*  become an anti JD rag. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  It has many problems, including seven anonymous quotes from cowardly Republicans. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  But most glaring factual error is the below, which says the Houthis killed their [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=245.92s)]
*  Americans last January. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=249.32s)]
*  Actually, the group responsible for the attack was the Islamic resistance in Iraq. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  Which is an entirely different militia group. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=254.12s)]
*  Now, you might say this is evidence of Krausher being the biggest hack in Washington. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=255.88s)]
*  And you may be correct. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=259.4s)]
*  Another very plausible explanation is that he's the dumbest journalist in Washington. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  Either way, shocking an error like this could get through his vaunted editorial [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=265.08s)]
*  process. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=269.52s)]
*  Yes, sick. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=271.08s)]
*  It's so funny to think that JD Vance is not going to play the role of a loyal dog to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=272.12s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=278.68s)]
*  Like, like JD Vance, who got the position because he is the best at brown nosing, is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=280.0s)]
*  not going to still turn around and be like, yeah, no, Mr. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=286.4s)]
*  President, you want to fucking do troops in Yemen? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=289.24s)]
*  I love that. I've I've I'll I'll lead the charge for you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=294.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, dude. JD Vance himself was really, really not on board. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  Like, there is no other country on the planet that does this to the United States of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  America. I cannot. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=310.84s)]
*  It's so insane that there are entire media operations that masquerade as Jewish media [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  operations, for the record, like Jewish Insider, that just simply are pro-Israel dishrags [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  that get bully people for not being sufficiently pro-Israel. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=329.68s)]
*  People who are themselves very much pro-Israel, by the way, there is no world in which JD [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=333.64s)]
*  Vance is unconditionally pro-Israel. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=338.76s)]
*  Like, what are we talking about? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=341.4s)]
*  Jesus Christ, Christ, dude. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=343.0s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=345.79999999999995s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=347.84s)]
*  And he has to respond. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=349.32s)]
*  The reason why he had to respond to that is because, oh, no, God forbid. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=350.64s)]
*  You guys understand how psychotic this is? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=354.12s)]
*  I'm not alone in this, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=356.32s)]
*  I hope. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=357.96s)]
*  Like, signal group chat leaks. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=359.68s)]
*  You got the New York Times paper of record writing analysis on how we have to literally [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  we have to do boots on the ground warfare in Yemen. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=368.24s)]
*  Bombing Yemen is not enough. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=371.12s)]
*  Simply bombing Yemen is not enough. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=372.6s)]
*  Obama did it. Trump did it first term. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=373.88s)]
*  Biden did it. And Trump is doing it again. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=377.08s)]
*  It's not enough, clearly. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=378.88s)]
*  They're undeterred. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=379.92s)]
*  We must deter them. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=381.36s)]
*  How do we deter them? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=382.6s)]
*  Boots on the ground. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=383.44s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=384.76s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=386.32s)]
*  This is not a country, OK? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=387.52s)]
*  We're not a serious country at all. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=390.44s)]
*  Anti-Semite. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=392.24s)]
*  Stop you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=394.24s)]
*  Stop you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=395.76s)]
*  They will say you are an anti anti-Semite. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=396.6s)]
*  Yeah. OK. First of all, they do say that already. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=399.64s)]
*  So welcome to the to the anti-Semitism headquarters over here. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=403.76s)]
*  OK. Are you new? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  I was nominated for an award. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  Genuine question just can't be like Iraq, right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  When we invaded 70 percent of America's beliefs, Saddam was involved in 9-11. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=417.12s)]
*  They would have to do a shit ton of manufacturing consent to get us to that point again. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=420.24s)]
*  I mean, judging by what liberals say or what liberals said under the Biden administration, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=423.24s)]
*  I still I'll be honest with you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=428.92s)]
*  I think that they don't really need to do much because the remnants of all of the consent [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=431.44s)]
*  that was manufactured for the war on terror post 9-11 in America is still very much here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=437.24s)]
*  So they don't need to do much. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=443.52s)]
*  They just need to be like they're back by Iran. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  Iran is big bad. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=446.64s)]
*  We have to kill them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=448.52s)]
*  They hate America. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=449.56s)]
*  They're burning American flags, which they are, which, by the way, they should. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=450.72s)]
*  Like, are you kidding me? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=453.56s)]
*  They're burning American flags and Israeli flags. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=454.84s)]
*  They're anti-Semitic. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=456.96s)]
*  You know, I what I don't understand is why no one is making the calculation of deterrence. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=458.48s)]
*  Like, I guess they're expecting Iran and Iranian restraint to be maintained in this [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=464.48s)]
*  process and that Iran won't actually retaliate of the weapons to Yemen to retaliate themselves [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  if they choose to do so, even though they have been doing that already by by by, you [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=477.04s)]
*  know, lighting Saudi oil refineries on fire and just causing a complete collapse of the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=484.24s)]
*  global economy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=492.36s)]
*  But that's it. That is the weapon here. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=493.56s)]
*  They don't need nukes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=495.88s)]
*  They can just like dump payload on top of oil refineries and just nuke the global economy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  America is a threat to Americans. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=503.32000000000005s)]
*  The LMFAO reaching. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=505.32s)]
*  Yeah, they don't have the capability of arming Yemen in a ground invasion. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=507.52s)]
*  No, I'm not saying that I'm saying that a permanent military occupation in Yemen will [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=511.44s)]
*  be devastating for America as it is devastating for Yemen. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=517.2s)]
*  But it'll be especially and I'm going to say this again, devastating for America. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=521.3199999999999s)]
*  And in that process, they will light half of the oil refineries on fire. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=525.8s)]
*  They have done so in the past as a symbolic gesture before. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=531.2s)]
*  I don't think Saudi Arabia wants that either. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=535.44s)]
*  And if you weren't so hard to defend Israel inside of the State Department, you would [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=537.8000000000001s)]
*  have to recognize that that is a very foreseeable outcome of all of this. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know why. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=548.76s)]
*  I don't know why they're that they're like, no, no, no, we have to because the other the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=551.4s)]
*  pathway out of this, of course, as I have mentioned time and time again, is to rein [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=556.4s)]
*  in America's attack dog and to say you're done, you're done, it's over, you're done, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=562.2s)]
*  it's over, you're it's done. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=567.68s)]
*  No more. OK, enough. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=571.48s)]
*  That's it. That's all you need to do. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=573.92s)]
*  All it takes a phone call. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  If they stop, if America forces Israel to stop in Gaza, Yemen no longer implements a [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=577.16s)]
*  blockade in the Red Sea. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=583.76s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=585.64s)]
*  We already know that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=587.92s)]
*  They have done it and that's it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=590.12s)]
*  That's all it would take. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=591.84s)]
*  That's all that is something that has happened thus far. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=594.04s)]
*  So I just I don't understand how like that is such a such an impossible goal from the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=598.0s)]
*  perspective of the American State Department rather than lighting the entire region and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=603.96s)]
*  potentially oil refineries on fire in the process. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj-HVXoP5k&t=609.2s)]
