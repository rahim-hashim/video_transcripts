# The Luka Trade Is INSANE | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY)
*  This, the trade makes more sense with Dalton connect and first pigs and more first pigs, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=0.0s)]
*  but he ate him so much. He got fleas. Yeah. I mean that it does make sense. Dalton connect [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=4.46s)]
*  also, you know, very talented, fills a different role, but still, I mean, Lucas still better [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=10.1s)]
*  wall street impacted the Luca trade. First of all, there is a real impact on the Luca [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=17.3s)]
*  trade. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=23.5s)]
*  We need your take on Luca dude. There's no take on Luca. What, what kind of question [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=29.12s)]
*  is this? It's literally the stupidest trade of all time. I mean, it's great if you're [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=33.76s)]
*  living Los Angeles. It's great if you want LeBron to win another ring at the age of like [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=38.46s)]
*  50. You know what I mean? It's probably not going to happen, but like either he is the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=44.68s)]
*  most injured person in the NBA and it's just been kept a massive secret and therefore this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=49.96s)]
*  is seemingly the best trade of all time, or it's the most insane trade of all time. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=56.0s)]
*  I don't understand. Lucas, one of the best players in the NBA. They're saying Luca was [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=63.04s)]
*  too fat. Yo, white boy gets a little fat. All of a sudden you drop him like a bad habit. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=67.42s)]
*  What the hell are we doing here? What are we doing? What do you mean? He was too fat. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=72.08s)]
*  What do you mean? It was too fat. It doesn't matter. He's a baby. Still he's young, incredibly [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  talented, has an insane, he has an insane point making ability. What? Anyway. Oh my [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=82.88s)]
*  God. He hitting him in a way so he didn't even know either. I don't care if he's 500 [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  pounds. He's averaging triple doubles. Yeah. It doesn't make sense how fat he is. It's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=100.96s)]
*  not like Zion where he's super injury prone and not performing. If he's performing, who [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  cares about his fat ass? You got centled. You got sent out the big Broadway. Is this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=112.18s)]
*  fake? Did you see Alicia? He's talk about the children, not the better ones. I got to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=118.18s)]
*  say the Grammys. I just found out she's pro is real today. Apparently the math GM hated [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  him on a personal level of room. Critically clear why this trade happened. And the reason [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=130.5s)]
*  is the Dallas Mavericks front office absolutely hates bro. I in my head cannon. You want to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  know what I think in my head? Cannon Luca is super, super pro Palestine. Okay. Super [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=141.3s)]
*  pro Palestine. And he just basically, he basically said like, listen, you know, I want to travel [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=148.58s)]
*  to the Gaza strip. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=157.26000000000002s)]
*  I want to actually put my life down and become a martyr for the Palestinian population. Okay. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  I think it's unconscionable. What Israel's do. Madelson heard all of the more pro Palestine [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=168.38s)]
*  and Kyrie. He was like, this is it. Like it's messed up. Miriam Adelson hears about it and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=172.06s)]
*  says send his ass to Los Angeles. Okay. Exile him right now to Los Angeles. I don't care [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=177.78s)]
*  who you get in the trade. They asked everyone in the team, if they condemn Hamas and Lucas [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=186.1s)]
*  said, I do not condemn Hamas. You will never. He said the people yearn for emancipation. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=190.74s)]
*  The emancipatory yearning of a, of a people's is impossible to silence. You will not silence [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=197.28s)]
*  them. Design is entity must be dismantled. So they sent them to Los Angeles. Actually [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=204.12s)]
*  Luca has been donating Islamic jihad for years. It's true. That literally makes more sense [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=210.12s)]
*  to the James actual explanation. I know because I tried to understand what was going on and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=214.82s)]
*  it's impossible to decipher because it's kind of like, you know what it is. It reminds me [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=219.44s)]
*  of Trump's tariffs. Okay. Not to make, not to make everything political, but it reminds [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=225.12s)]
*  me of Donald Trump's tariffs because it makes no sense. It's not like, like Donald Trump [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=231.0s)]
*  will oftentimes do things that at least have like a messed up logic behind it. I might [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  not agree with it. I might say, I disagree with this decision. I think this is going [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  to yield negative results, but at least there's some semblance of, of logic behind this decision [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=247.6s)]
*  making process. Not here though. I don't understand why the he's doing these tariffs [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=253.36s)]
*  because it just seemingly only harms him. It's like it only harms himself. Okay. Global [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=258.64s)]
*  trade benefits us. We are the country that designed global trade. Okay. In a way that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  benefits us in our capital owners, obviously not the regular American working class, but [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  like it makes no sense when you do tariff wars with 55% of your trading partners, right? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=277.16s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. And this trade reminds me of that where it's like, why would [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=283.44s)]
*  you do this? Why would you do this? It doesn't make sense. Like you just, you just cut out [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=288.44s)]
*  unlimited potential from a relatively younger player because he got fat. It doesn't make [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=294.96s)]
*  any sense. And the decision making process is so silly. I've listened to the GM talk [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  side by side with, with, with Jason kid and his face says a lot more than what the GM [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=309.12s)]
*  is saying. Okay. Nico Harrison is talking and he's like, Oh yeah, we made this decision [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=315.68s)]
*  because we're looking for team chemistry and Jason kids sitting there. Like he's sitting [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=322.4s)]
*  there literally contemplating on the most creative way of killing himself. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=326.44s)]
*  I've never seen a person literally look around for household items in front of them. Like [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=332.84s)]
*  which one of these could impale me faster? Like how could I make the most impact if I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=337.68s)]
*  just sepulchred myself right here in the press room? Okay. GM of the mavericks is fat phobic. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=343.48s)]
*  You're a casual little bro. That's true. That's true. I am a casual. Okay. I'm a passive [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=351.36s)]
*  consumer, not even a consumer of the NBA at all. Okay. I care more about the drama of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=357.68s)]
*  the NBA. This is part of the reason why this is a funny story because it's like, so such [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=363.8s)]
*  an insane trade. How was this emblematic of America's decline? Okay. Let me think not [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=368.0s)]
*  to make everything about true Hassan got some casual takes. Maybe you guys understand it [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=374.88s)]
*  and you can explain it to me, but for me it doesn't make sense. Like dude, if I'm living [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=380.12s)]
*  in Dallas, I would be myself. Like what is, what are we doing here? Like what the hell's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=385.96s)]
*  going on? How did this happen? How could this have happened? Somehow it's still Mary [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=392.26s)]
*  Maddelson's fault. They brought a car into the stadium. Oh no. I mean, this is what I [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=398.3s)]
*  mean. I'm from Dallas. I hate this team. Now. What do you mean? You're from Dallas. You [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=406.5s)]
*  have to love it regardless. You just have to suck it up. Biden couldn't destroy the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=411.7s)]
*  four years. It took Trump 12 days. I think you're seeing something in Jason kid that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=417.21999999999997s)]
*  wasn't there. That's just his face. No, he looked like he looked like he looked like [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=423.78s)]
*  Azrael. The angel of death was in the room and he had also made peace. Okay. He had made [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  peace with the angel of death. He literally was just like, yeah, okay. Yoke, it's better [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=442.78s)]
*  and fatter. See, that's the other thing. That's the other thing. The fatter these white boys [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=448.06s)]
*  get the better they get. It's like a speed buff. I don't know. Don't ask me questions. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=454.02s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. It's just how it is. So you, you, you might be thinking, Oh, this [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=460.94s)]
*  injured Luca. Okay. This is injured Luca. Like he's, he's gotten fatter than he ever [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=467.38s)]
*  has before. What you don't realize is it's prime Luca. The fatter he is, the better he [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=473.21999999999997s)]
*  is. This is how these guys work. Okay. I don't know why. I don't know why the Balkans, they [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=479.82s)]
*  figured something out. Okay. But the tubbier they get the better, the tubbier Luca gets [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=488.94s)]
*  the better his, his pauses get. Okay. He can just, he can accelerate and decelerate faster [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=496.97999999999996s)]
*  somehow. I don't know why it doesn't make sense. How was he doing that? Everyone's asking [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=504.26s)]
*  these questions. How is he doing that? How does he constantly change speed when the person [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=510.05999999999995s)]
*  in front of him that is infinitely more athletic is unable to change speed at the same time? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=516.6999999999999s)]
*  Why is he able to do that? The fatter he gets, nobody knows. Don't ask these questions. Okay. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=523.0999999999999s)]
*  You don't want the answers to these questions. Little bro. The news Luca was ours. Oh my God. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=529.66s)]
*  28.6 points per game. Third best all time. 80 triple doubles [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  five. All NBA first teams in the first six seasons. Luca was ours. Dude. Damn y'all, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=542.22s)]
*  man. Are you insane? Look at him. He's only 25 chat. It makes no sense. And, and think [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=554.94s)]
*  about it. First of all, I'm going to make a funny racism joke, but it's a white boy [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=566.38s)]
*  swaggering out in the NBA in Texas. Okay. That's really important on a team that [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=571.4200000000001s)]
*  demonstrates white boys swag and white boy excellence to begin with historically. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=578.7s)]
*  So there's a lot of different, there's a lot of different plot lines here at play. They lost [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=583.4200000000001s)]
*  their D I higher. It makes no sense. I mean, it's funny. I mean, great. It's great for LA. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=589.5s)]
*  La GM really gets what he wants. Yeah. LeBron is no longer the just the general manager of the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=595.82s)]
*  Lakers. He is now the general manager of the, of the NBA. LeBron was like, I want Luca, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=600.78s)]
*  give me Luca, make sure he's the fattest he's ever been. I want Luca to be here. I want him to, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=606.86s)]
*  I want him to play with Lenard, I E my son, I E Brawny. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=612.78s)]
*  This fat bullshit is such obvious shit talking from the mans of the media to take some of the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=620.86s)]
*  heat off, but who would even buy this? I don't think anybody would buy this. LeBron didn't know [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=624.22s)]
*  about the straight. LeBron knows about every trade before it even happens. LeBron knows about [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=628.54s)]
*  trades that hasn't that haven't happened yet. I thought this could be ownership. I thought this [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=632.78s)]
*  could be ownership interference, but all the info we've gotten since it's happened indicates that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=638.2199999999999s)]
*  this is one man, Nico Harrison, the GM he's just out of his mind. He is a basketball and he is [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=643.66s)]
*  taking this plane down. This video was funny when it first came out. Now we know that this was [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=649.5799999999999s)]
*  genuine hatred and this, this isn't Nico Harrison. This is Michael Finley, but it's like you fat slob, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=654.22s)]
*  put down the beer, you animal. Nico Harrison first met with Rob Polinka on January 7th to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=659.1s)]
*  potentially talk about this move. And over the next month he was groomed. They took his own [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=664.94s)]
*  hatred for Luca. His hatred of Luca was so deep that Rob Polinka was able to talk him out of more [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=670.22s)]
*  first round picks and Dalton connect and more stuff by being like, you know, you, you really are [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=677.34s)]
*  right. He's a fat, disgusting slob, animal guy. He he's trash. I mean, I'm, I'll do you this favor. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=682.62s)]
*  I like you. I guess I'll, I guess I'll take him, but God, man, this guy, this Luca guy, fat. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=689.5s)]
*  I mean, I, I did the, I learned about the classic background. I didn't know anything about [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=695.26s)]
*  the GM specifically, but like, um, they, they keep talking about his like Steph Curry fumble [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOwKyfUTxvY&t=699.9s)]
