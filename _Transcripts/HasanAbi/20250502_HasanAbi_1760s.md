# Israel Drones Hit Gaza AID Flotilla | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE)
*  This is like the starvation has gotten significantly worse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=0.0s)]
*  There have been moments where famine has become imminent inside of Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=5.44s)]
*  Obviously, even before October 7, there's been instances where [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=9.84s)]
*  there have been instances where Israel had limited the calories, the daily caloric intake [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=14.8s)]
*  of the average Gazan, which they also hilariously consider. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=20.56s)]
*  They call it putting the Palestinians on a diet. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk about the flotilla for a little bit because I do want to cover that breaking [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=30.88s)]
*  at 1223 Maltese time until the ship was subjected to a drone attack. The front of the vessel was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=40.96s)]
*  targeted twice resulting in a fire and a breach in the hall. The ship is currently located at [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=47.04s)]
*  international waters near Malta and SOS distress signal was sent. This is not this similar to the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=50.64s)]
*  Mavi Marmara Gaza flotilla that some humanitarians in Turkey put together to try to go into the Gaza [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=56.4s)]
*  Strip with humanitarian aid. Israel very famously dropped commandos into this ship and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=66.32s)]
*  these humanitarian aid workers. It was a massive, it was a massive, massively consequential event [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=75.52s)]
*  that caused a lot of ruckus. And yet, of course, as things go with Israel, they basically, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=83.36s)]
*  pack that shit up and never really talked about it ever again. Turkey still maintained its [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=92.48s)]
*  relationship with Israel, but Ardogan was very, very upset, very upset aesthetically against Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=96.56s)]
*  But they still very much kept dealing with Israel in the ways that they were the Turkish government. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=103.04s)]
*  This time, the dynamic is a little bit different because this isn't even going through the six [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  mile shoreline of Gaza. This time, the Israeli air forces drone-striked a humanitarian [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=116.24s)]
*  aid ship that was off the coastline of Malta, approximately 1200 plus miles away from the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=126.24s)]
*  Israeli shoreline. So this is international waters that Israel is violating. This is some [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=135.04s)]
*  America shit. Even if America were to do something like this and they do things like this all the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  time, people would probably be like, what are you doing? You can't just do that. That's insane. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=149.2s)]
*  And yeah, look, the Israeli Navy was showing great restraint as they could have easily blown [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=154.56s)]
*  those boats right out of the water. Stay out of active theaters of war and you won't be disappointed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=158.56s)]
*  Active theaters of war. All of the waters all around the world belong to Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  Definitely illegal. Not even remotely a question. The legality of this action is not in question at [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=170.0s)]
*  all. It's 1200 miles away from the fucking coastline of Gaza. They didn't even wait for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=178.4s)]
*  this humanitarian aid ship to come anywhere near the Gaza coastline to blow it up and kill the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  people in it like they did with the Mavi Marmara. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=189.92s)]
*  The night, a Mayday call from an aid ship en route to Gaza. 26 kilometers off the coast of Malta, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  the conscious caught fire in international waters after being struck by drones twice. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=200.48s)]
*  A pro-Palestinian activist group, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the trip, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=206.32s)]
*  reported a strike which it says targeted the ship's generator, breaching the vessel's hull. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  12 crew and four activists were on board at the time of the attack, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  but all were rescued in the early hours of the morning. In a statement, the Maltese government [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=221.6s)]
*  said it dispatched a tug to combat the fire and a patrol vessel to provide further assistance at [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=226.48s)]
*  the scene. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition has campaigned against Israel's blockade. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  Houthi's blockade and local waters bad. Israel bomb aid and international water is good. Yeah, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=236.56s)]
*  and also the reason why the Houthis are doing that is obviously to not just erroneously restrict [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=240.56s)]
*  international commerce. They're doing that with a specific purpose in mind. They're doing the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=245.92s)]
*  right thing and they've stopped doing that in times of ceasefire as promised, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=251.04s)]
*  They're doing that because they want Israel to stop doing a genocide in Gaza. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=257.2s)]
*  This is precisely the reason why they are morally on the right side of not only history, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=262.32s)]
*  but also even I think, I guess like legally they are in a justifiable position. Like you can, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=266.4s)]
*  it is a legally defensible position. Having said that Israel right here is not in a morally [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=273.68s)]
*  justifiable or legal position at all. Like not even defensible as an age three fan. I started [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=279.6s)]
*  to listen to you about a month ago and I feel you will be able to change more people's minds [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  from the other fans. Hopefully. Frogs recent video has also helped me get out of this madness. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=289.04s)]
*  Oh wow. Israel officially apologized and paid reparations. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=294.0s)]
*  Nathan Yahu, apologize. Turkish prime minister for the Israeli role in the Gaza flow till a raid. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=298.4s)]
*  Obama broke his car between Netanyahu and Adelon says Israel says, sorry for the 2010 [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=302.24s)]
*  Naval radio. This is, this is three years after the fact where they said, oopsie, we're bad. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=306.08s)]
*  We're we're are bad. Sorry after, Hey, you know, ironically what they said before then [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=311.68s)]
*  in the immediate aftermath of the commandos literally massacring these humanitarian aid [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=317.52s)]
*  workers on the Mavi monomership in the Gaza flotilla was the same technique that Israel [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=322.88s)]
*  always utilizes where they come out with like the dumbest propaganda of all time, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=327.92s)]
*  or they were like, well, these guys actually told us in, in our correspondence, they said, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  remember nine 11, they said the, the, the least Turkish sounding guy apparently told the, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  the Israeli coast guard, go back to our schwitz. Remember not 11. That's what they, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  that's that, that was their argument. Yeah. And then they also did the other thing that is very [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  funny, even though it's horrifying, but it's funny because it's a pattern that keeps repeating over [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=361.44s)]
*  and over again. They showcased all of the dangerous weapons that were on the humanitarian aid ship. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=366.32s)]
*  The weapons were kitchen knives and sticks. They shot them with automatic rifles from a attack [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=372.4s)]
*  helicopter and literally, unironically presented this as why they had to do that regime's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=379.84s)]
*  expectation that everyone must believe their stupid lies. The occupation forces did the same [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=389.35999999999996s)]
*  thing with Mavi in 2010. They collect the knives in the kitchen, some wrench from the engine room [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=392.96s)]
*  and some mandatory access on emergency boats. They tried to show the world these are guns, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  a pack of idiots think the world is as stupid as they are. There is no gun or any evidence [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=401.52s)]
*  connected with Hamas at the Shiva hospital. This is a disgusting lie. This was a, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=407.68s)]
*  when they were talking about the Shiva hospital report after, you know, why they had to bomb [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=410.96s)]
*  Al-Shifa and take it over. Yeah. This was after the mob murmur. They unironically posted this. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  They were like, look at these CDs. These are terror CDs. There are terror chains. This is [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=420.32s)]
*  the whole scarf. The whole list. Yeah. Look at this. This is a knife, a knife of terror. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=425.2s)]
*  By the way, shouts out to the Yemeni knife that made its way into this boat. Respect. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=435.6s)]
*  Respect to the Yemeni. Okay. Anti-Semitic accent. Yes, I know. I know. Yeah. These are, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=439.68s)]
*  you might think these are screwdrivers, but they are screwdrivers of terror. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=445.76s)]
*  They are sanding discs, not CDs. Oh, well, they're not sanding discs. They are sanding discs of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=450.32s)]
*  terror. I think this was one of my first, like, this was one of the first moments where I was like, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=457.76s)]
*  damn, these guys are up. Like, I think it was mobbing, modern that I guess is like, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=463.68s)]
*  because when you're growing up in Turkey, you don't really ever like think about it where you're just [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=469.92s)]
*  like, yeah, it's really tough that they're doing those things. The Palestinians like, but that was [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=473.92s)]
*  my, I believe that might've been one of my more formative moments where I was like, yeah, this is [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=478.48s)]
*  actually completely unacceptable. This project is out of control. That's how I got this. Hopefully [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=482.48s)]
*  this ends Ethan unintentionally spreading Islamophobic rhetoric. If he can move on from this topic. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know if that'll happen, but I do. I will hopefully address some of those things [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=491.76s)]
*  pretty crazy. The drone, the drone struck an eight convoy that had Greta Thunberg on it. They are [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=498.64s)]
*  getting more comfortable attacking advocates even outside of Gaza and occupied territories. Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=503.2s)]
*  I, I'm not going to lie. The way that the world responds to this, especially the Western world, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=508.64s)]
*  the way the Western world responds to this is making things a little bit scary. I won't lie to [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=515.76s)]
*  you like, so what's up? Like, can they just kill Westerners that are living in their homes and shit? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=520.72s)]
*  Like what's next? You know what I mean? Like they're expanding the theater of war to the Maltese [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=528.0s)]
*  coastline. What are we doing? We can't, this is the moment where every European leader should be [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=534.48s)]
*  like, Nope, it's over. You're done. You know what I mean? She said she was meant to be honest. She [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=539.44s)]
*  wasn't on it herself. Oh, here, here, here, here. This is the unedited. This is the unedited radio [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  transmission between the Gaza flotilla and Israeli Navy on the 31st of May. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=549.6s)]
*  Shut up. Go back to Auschwitz. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=556.64s)]
*  Shout out. Go back to Auschwitz. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=561.12s)]
*  MK Lambert. Thank you for the 50 of the subs. Shut up. Go back to Auschwitz. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=566.32s)]
*  Yeah. Remember 9 11. Shut up. Go back to Auschwitz. Remember 9 11. You know, anyway, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=571.2s)]
*  Felix's tweet is on point on this. I mean, last time I did this, you know, I got in trouble. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=586.32s)]
*  Every time I read a Felix tweet, I get in trouble. But let's see what he said. If the EU doesn't [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  treat this as they should just move everything from Brussels to Tel Aviv to finish the process, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=597.36s)]
*  give Vonderlein his job to some gum disease afflicted settler while they're at it. Maybe [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=600.24s)]
*  if someone told him these guys were also Russian. I'm shaking my head in disagreement with Felix [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=604.88s)]
*  Biederman. Have fun with the debate. It's on. Remember, you're talking to a cult of [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=612.48s)]
*  personality. Stay cool and funny. Expect the unexpected. It's all about the clips, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=615.2s)]
*  unfortunately. Yeah, but we got the clip got in here. We got 52,000 people in here. We have our [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=618.8s)]
*  own clip army. You know, we can go bam for bam. We can go clip for clip. Do not engage inside info [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=623.52s)]
*  that either is going to surprise attack you with Hitler joining the call to debate you. What do [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=630.8s)]
*  not engage? What are you saying? Grant? They've thought it was set to release on May 26, 2026. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=634.4s)]
*  It's been pushed back by the way. Didn't want to bring this to your attention, but unfortunately [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=639.04s)]
*  that is what's going on. It's now set to release on May 26, 2026. We are very sorry that this is [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=645.28s)]
*  later than you expected, but I don't have an issue with this because honestly, I trustfully [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=650.4s)]
*  they haven't and should have find themselves as well. And in order for this work of art, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=654.9599999999999s)]
*  in order for this work of art to actually be a real work of art that is fully fleshed out, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=663.12s)]
*  you know, it's gonna, it's gonna take some time. All right. Let's look at of Gaza for years, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=670.0799999999999s)]
*  sending multiple humanitarian aid ships to the enclave. It has accused Israel of being behind [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=676.32s)]

*  allegations. More activists were due to board the vessel, among them Greta Thunberg. It's now [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=687.6s)]
*  not a single bottle of water has entered Gaza and it's a systematic starvation of two million people [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=693.7600000000001s)]
*  and we all have a moral responsibility to act against that and to do our part to demand [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=702.24s)]
*  accountability for war criminals and, and our own government's complicity in this genocide. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=709.2s)]
*  Israel has blocked all aid deliveries to Gaza since March the 2nd as part of an effort to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  pressure Hamas back into a hostage deal. The Red Cross reports humanitarian operations in Gaza [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=722.08s)]
*  are on the brink of total collapse. Two months after Israel closed all crossings to the Gaza strip, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=728.48s)]
*  there are warnings that mass starvation could be imminent. The UN's World Food Programme and UNRWA, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=735.04s)]
*  the Agency for Palestinian Refugees, say they've used up all their food stocks and there's little [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=740.96s)]
*  left to buy. A few dozen remaining food kitchens are the only source of a daily meal for hundreds [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=746.72s)]
*  of thousands of people. Let's speak to our Middle East correspondent Yiland now. These warnings [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  are dire, Yiland. That's right and what we've seen in the past day or so are more powerful [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=758.16s)]
*  statements coming from top UN officials about this blockade that has gone on now for two months in [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=766.24s)]
*  Gaza. You had the emergency director of the World Health Organisation saying that what was unfolding [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=773.36s)]
*  was an abomination. He said if we don't do something about it we're complicit in what is [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=779.52s)]
*  happening. And then he had the UN's humanitarian chief saying this was a cruel and collective [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=784.8s)]
*  punishment of Palestinians and he said that quite simply blocking aid kills. Now Israel has [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=790.0s)]
*  previously denied that there is a hunger crisis in Gaza and it's just not clear at the moment [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  when aid will be allowed back in. A hot meal is hard to come by in Gaza but for needy [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=805.8399999999999s)]
*  families in the south a delivery is on its way. Today's dish is koshri made with lentils, rice [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=814.64s)]
*  and a tomato sauce cooked in a community kitchen by American Near East Refugee Aid. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=822.0s)]
*  This will feed about 6 000 people. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=828.88s)]
*  Sami Mata says his team is doing the best it can in desperate circumstances. In the past we [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=837.84s)]
*  used to cook rice with meat with the protein. Now there is no any type of meat or vegetables also [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=844.4s)]
*  entered Gaza. The people rely on our meats. Israel blocked all goods to Gaza two months ago [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  and then resumed its military offensive saying this was to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=861.12s)]
*  Food stockpiled during the ceasefire at the start of this year has all but run out. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=867.6s)]
*  We used to receive more than 100 trucks every week and now we don't have anything in our warehouse. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  There is no food parcels, no flower bags. Within two weeks Gaza's community kitchens, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=882.08s)]
*  a last lifeline for so many, will have to shut down. If the situation will continue [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=890.96s)]
*  with the closure of the crossings Gaza will face again the risk of starvation. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=897.4399999999999s)]
*  Al Mawasi is a sprawling tent camp for displaced people. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=906.24s)]
*  Conditions here are tough and getting tougher. This man's been searching unsuccessfully for bread. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=913.4399999999999s)]
*  Now he can feed his family of seven. Others are also thankful for the handouts. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=920.88s)]
*  At this time it's excellent because there's no cooking gas, no food. I collect leaves to start [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=927.6800000000001s)]
*  a fire just so we can have a cup of tea. Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid but humanitarian [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=933.2800000000001s)]
*  workers say they closely monitor their supplies. With rising cases of acute malnutrition among [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=940.4000000000001s)]
*  children there are warnings that starving civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=947.36s)]
*  For now in Gaza as the cooking pots are washed up there's no choice but to live day by day. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=955.84s)]
*  When was this published? This is like the starvation has gotten significantly worse. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=961.84s)]
*  There have been moments where famine has become imminent inside of Gaza. Obviously even before [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=969.12s)]
*  October 7 there have been instances where Israel had limited the calories, the daily caloric intake [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=974.72s)]
*  of the average Gazan, which they also hilariously consider. They call it putting the Palestinians on [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=984.32s)]
*  a diet but it greatly escalated when the war criminal Yoav Galant said that we needed to [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=991.2s)]
*  shut off, Israel needed to shut off water, power, electricity and aid into Gaza because they were [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=999.2800000000001s)]
*  fighting human animals, they were fighting beasts and then they did that which is of course a direct [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1006.0s)]
*  war crime not allowed at all. That is a direct violation of international human rights. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1016.08s)]
*  So Israel's done a lot of stuff that is not by the book and it's unique in terms of for example [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  it's targeting of enemy combatants like people that they declare enemy combatants versus the [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1030.16s)]
*  civilian casualties as collateral. In previous circumstances that used to be like a one to five [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1037.44s)]
*  ratio let's say now it's like a one to one hundred ratio and it's fucking insane and all of that [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1045.6s)]
*  stuff is completely indefensible and obviously genocidal but this is a clear cut, clear cut [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1051.6799999999998s)]
*  violation of international human rights law. Denying humanitarian aid and food, like denying [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1061.4399999999998s)]
*  humanitarian aid from going into the Gaza Strip is exterminationist in principle. That's precisely [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1070.24s)]
*  the reason why the former head of the Human Rights Watch if I'm not mistaken who is a Holocaust [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1076.48s)]
*  survivor himself I think even he said like I was pro-Israel at first and then when I realized that [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1082.88s)]
*  Israel is denying aid into the Gaza Strip that's when I realized this is a genocide. He had said [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1090.72s)]
*  he had said initially before before the like in the aftermath of October 7 he initially said like [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1098.8000000000002s)]
*  oh Israel's all right to defend itself stuff like that. He literally changed his mind on it [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1106.8000000000002s)]
*  because of this because this is a very clear cut violation it's not there is no justification for [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  it. Assuming we have a stable government would you support a booze on the ground invasion of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1118.4s)]
*  Israel of conditions deteriorate further it feels infinitely more justifiable never gonna happen. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1121.2s)]
*  In any case the starvation deaths I believe are still under 100 since October 7th I believe so [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1126.16s)]
*  when Gaza death numbers is relatively low but I expect it soon to increase rapidly so yes [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1130.48s)]
*  the famine numbers are not going to be by the tens of thousands if not millions until it's too late [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1135.76s)]
*  right. That's precisely the reason why through pressure through outside pressure Israel has [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  at certain moments during like the ceasefire for example allowed aid to go in to the Gaza Strip. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1152.4s)]
*  This has for a little bit allowed the Gazans to get food again but that food has run out now [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1158.56s)]
*  because it's been eight weeks since Israel has allowed any humanitarian aid to enter [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1165.92s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. This is completely unacceptable there is not you will never be able to find [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1171.1200000000001s)]
*  a single person that isn't like Adolf Hitler okay that will turn around and say this is a [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1176.96s)]
*  justifiable thing to do. There is no like this is the reason why I mention this is because it is the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1182.4s)]
*  clear cut that the most dead to rights definitional exterminationist policy that you can point to with [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1188.64s)]
*  no defense whatsoever it is completely indefensible which is precisely the reason why Israel [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1196.32s)]
*  routinely lies about it and will say oh well we let in this much aid we let in this many trucks [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1200.72s)]
*  this many tons of aid into the Gaza Strip and it's just Hamas stealing the aid or whatever it's [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1205.84s)]
*  bullshit. Hamas are terrorists dude thanks man. Jacob Berger DM wants to talk about the flotilla [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1210.3999999999999s)]
*  on stream with you brother do you think I'm gonna be able to talk to Jacob Berger about the flotilla [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1216.48s)]
*  right now? I'm about to in 10 minutes I'm gonna go on a fucking zoom call with Ethan Klein okay [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1221.04s)]

*  Ethan Klein is my former podcast co-host we had a political podcast where I explained to him [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1241.04s)]
*  you know things that were going on in the world called Leftovers we did that for two years and [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1247.52s)]
*  then it ended after October 7th. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1252.24s)]
*  Today aid officials and Palestinian residents in Gaza have been talking about how there were [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1259.52s)]
*  some significant looting incidents involving aid earlier this week five in total on Wednesday [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1266.48s)]
*  and they were at the UN's main complex for UNRWA in Gaza also at some businessman stores and [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1275.04s)]
*  in community kitchens as well and UNRWA has said that there were thousands of displaced people who [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1283.12s)]
*  involved in the raid on its premises and that medicines were stolen from its pharmacy there [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1289.12s)]
*  were some cars damaged as well and the UNRWA spokeswoman has said that you know this while [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1296.2399999999998s)]
*  devastating is not surprising in the face of total systemic collapse those are her words. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1302.56s)]
*  Yulanda what signs are there if any that international pressure is having any effect [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1309.4399999999998s)]
*  on Israel to lift the blockade? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1315.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean it's notable that some of Israel's closest allies have spoken out about this we had [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1319.1999999999998s)]
*  a statement that was from its closest European allies the UK, Germany and France demanding that [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1324.6399999999999s)]
*  the blockade stop and talking about the acute risk of starvation for children we had also [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1331.9199999999998s)]
*  President Trump one week ago so supportive of Israel telling journalists that he had told [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1340.08s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister that Israel has got to be good to Gaza it's got to allow food and medicines [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1346.88s)]
*  in but we have not seen any change in Israeli policy in fact it's so crazy the way that we all [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1353.92s)]
*  talk about it where we just have a straight-up Nazi government doing Holocaust stuff and everyone [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1360.64s)]
*  has to just posture like there's nothing we can do about it it is very shocking to me like [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1367.28s)]
*  because the Nazis engaged in horrific unimaginable amounts of cruelty towards [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1375.52s)]
*  six million Jews and also another you know almost 10 million people that were also branded as like [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1383.92s)]
*  worthy of being killed okay but the reality is while that was happening we didn't have the [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1394.72s)]
*  internet we didn't have like day-to-day access to the people that were being slaughtered [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1401.68s)]
*  okay we didn't just like watch it unfold every single day and it's so insane because obviously [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1406.96s)]
*  times are different you know we didn't have nukes back then we didn't have the internet back then [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1414.72s)]
*  we didn't know what the fuck was going on but it's like it's crazy to me that like a version of that [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1419.04s)]
*  is unfolding in front of our eyes every single fucking day and the global leadership is not [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1426.08s)]
*  only going oh please cut it out as though they're just simply doing their best they're very best to [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1434.6399999999999s)]

*  but it's not just that they go Israel stop like Donald Trump going Vladimir stop they also are [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1450.96s)]
*  actively bankrolling it they're actively bankrolling it to be fair you are saying that as if the United [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1459.8400000000001s)]
*  States did something about Hitler and didn't just do nothing when he was on the Holocaust shit and [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1465.2800000000002s)]
*  doing Liebensraum but like do you not okay you know no disrespect to FDR here but like it did [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1468.56s)]
*  feel like it does it does read as though he was interested in going to war with Germany and [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1476.32s)]
*  specifically Japan as well and also my point was that there was intelligence that came out of the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1481.9199999999998s)]
*  camps that that that was that was damning like people were like I think these guys are using [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1489.2s)]

*  camps were liberated okay like no one in the world fully saw the the horrifying reality until [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1500.48s)]
*  it was too late my point is we're watching it unfold right now and people are still going [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1510.72s)]

*  that facade is breaking apart with the likes of Donald Trump and the the obvious authoritarianism [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1602.8s)]
*  that they're engaging in and the very little defense that we as a society have towards that [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1608.96s)]
*  is is I think showing the reality that we don't have any power against our governments [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1615.68s)]

*  reason Israel has said that is holding off from ending the war in accordance with what Hamas [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmLmscvkCE&t=1663.52s)]
