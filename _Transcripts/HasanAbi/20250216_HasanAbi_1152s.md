# A Government Worker's Message For Elon Musk | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo)
*  I don't like Trump personally, but it's kind of funny how he's most likely unknowingly dismantled [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=0.0s)]
*  the US state and his influence. Yeah. Yeah, no, he is. He is destroying the American empire piece by [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=4.0s)]
*  piece. Okay. Anyway, I do want to watch this. There's a message for Elon Musk. Government jobs [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=11.36s)]
*  have been government jobs. By the way, that's why due to the multiple centuries long dominance [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=24.56s)]
*  of the Ottoman empire, a lot of Christians still carry some resentment. I would say that it's more [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=32.48s)]
*  understandable resentment if you're a Balkan state or if you're like Romanian or some shit, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=40.56s)]
*  like that makes sense, but it certainly doesn't make sense if you're German. Okay. Like I get the, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=46.72s)]
*  I get the resentment that like Armenians or Greeks or any number of like Eastern European, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=54.32s)]
*  Eastern Europeans have towards the Ottoman empire, but it's ridiculous when you got like [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=60.88s)]
*  British people still holding some semblance of resentment against the goddamn Ottoman empire, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=66.4s)]
*  like all the sick man of Europe, like what the fuck? We almost got there, but we stopped at the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=70.88s)]
*  gates of Vienna because of the goddamn Polish, you know, should have, should have let us get there, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=75.44s)]
*  and beyond. Okay. Think about, think about how crazy, think about how crazy that shit would look. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying, wasn't the historical Dracula, one of those Ottoman slaves or his brother, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=90.8s)]
*  they were both, they were both, I don't know, would they be considered slaves? I don't think so. I [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=94.72s)]
*  think they were given, like it's the, it's the, I mean, it was, they were vassals. Vassal is the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  right term. They were hostages, vassals. They weren't slaves. It's, it's more so a political [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=107.76s)]
*  exchange that they, it's like a political exchange program basically to say like, don't fuck with us [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=115.04s)]
*  because we have your children. We have your next of kin. And also, yes, you're right. Vlad Dracula [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  Tepeş was the bad brother and the other brother was the good brother, fake ass, fake ass, learned [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=126.4s)]
*  impaling from the Ottomans too. And then used it against every Muslim he could find. And then, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=135.36s)]
*  and then, yeah, Vlad was a fake friend to Mehmet the Conqueror. I will never forgive and I will [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  never forget. Okay. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. And then he, and he got beheaded [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=147.36s)]
*  later on because he was a, he was a loser. His brother was the, his brother was better. I will [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  never forgive the Ottomans for fumbling the bag so hard, dude. You're literally from Iraq. You have [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=159.68s)]
*  no say in this process. Your ancestors on ironically played a role in the fumbling. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  What the are you saying? Imagine being an Iraqi and saying, I will never forgive the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  Ottomans for fumbling the bag so hard. Yeah. What were you guys doing? What were your grandparents [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  doing? Okay. Yeah, that's right. Collaborating with the fucking British empire. That's what I am [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=185.68s)]
*  card. Oh, it doesn't matter. You're you're a curd from Iraq. What were your grandparents doing? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=191.92s)]
*  That's right. They made movies about it. Listen, if you're, if you're from the MENA region, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=197.04s)]
*  okay. You can't be like, Oh, the Ottomans, they fumbled the bag. You played a role in that. Okay. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=203.6s)]
*  You played a role in that. That's you. You did that. Okay. Congratulations. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=209.44s)]
*  What about Palestinians? It's the same shit. It's across the board. There are a lot of Palestinians [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=214.16s)]
*  who are still on board with the with the caliphate. And then there were some Palestinians [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=219.6s)]
*  who were collaborating. It is what it is. You know, we all make mistakes, guys. It's fine. I, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=225.12s)]
*  I don't, you know, let bygones be bygones. I don't, I don't carry this resentment. He was [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  larving as a day's vault crusader to he derived his surname, which he came up with from the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=236.48s)]
*  disgrace and disbanded order the dragon. His daddy was a part of okay. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=239.76s)]
*  Hobbs have been under the microscope lately with the Trump administration promising sharp cuts to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=243.84s)]
*  the federal workforce. But many of us have little idea what some federal workers actually do. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Hence this report from our Robert Costa. Yeah. Yeah. If you want to know what it's like 500 years [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=256.88s)]
*  of Ottoman peace in Jerusalem, and then 30 years under the British fuckers ruined that shit [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=263.44s)]
*  literally overnight, dude. God damn the British. Holy shit. You sound like a British empire defender [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=268.0s)]
*  when discussing the Ottomans role in the Arab world. I mean, all I'm saying is, do you think [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=274.0s)]
*  the British were better? Yeah. I'm comparing the Ottoman empire to the British empire. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=280.0s)]
*  Look at what they did. We're living in it. What do you mean? Like, yeah, no, it certainly seems [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=284.96s)]
*  better to give all of that to the French and the British so they could figure that stuff out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=290.96s)]
*  Seems very good. Seems like, seems like they did a really good job. Victim blaming is crazy. I mean, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=297.6s)]
*  I'm memeing for the most part. Neo Arab nationalism will rise to defeat neo-Ottomanism. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=304.72s)]
*  Just you wait. Pasha. Yeah. I'm a guys. Yeah. I'm a lesser evil voter. Okay. And as a lesser evil [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=309.04s)]
*  voter, all I'm stating is as a lesser evil voter, there's clearly, there was clearly a lot more [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  stability before the Anglo dogs came back into the equation. Put some Angloids in the region. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=324.88s)]
*  Historically never good. Okay. The crusades put, put Euro, put some Euro cucks in there. All of a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=334.8s)]
*  sudden, shit blows up. You think complete subjugation of the Ottoman empire is better [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=342.64s)]
*  than self-determination? Wait, what? No, of course. Self-determination is significantly better. What [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=346.64s)]
*  are you talking about? I'm joking. To be fair, the Arabs were supporting, uh, Lawrence, T Lawrence, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=350.8s)]
*  who was a weeb for Arab culture and was quirked up white boy who shocked them with Arabic. Yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=362.56s)]
*  That's why it's, there's nothing more dangerous. There's nothing more dangerous than a quirked up [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  white boy who can speak the language. Okay. They are a threat always. Everyone's fascinated by them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=373.92s)]
*  First they go, Oh, look at white monkey. Go look at white monkey. Go. And then before you know it, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=380.72s)]
*  they're like, Oh my God, how did this happen? How the did this happen? We are so cooked. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=384.88s)]
*  You've named the coal mining country of my Palestinian dad thinks the Ottoman empire is the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=389.68s)]
*  reason why the Levanteen Phoenicians got fucked and everything bad that is now happening is now [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=394.48s)]
*  happening because of the Ottoman empire. Classic Levanteen Arab diaspora. That's hilarious. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Morning the deaths of 15 miners and a methane gas explosion three days ago. Rescuers tonight [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=403.76s)]
*  struggled to reach miners trapped by smoke and flames near Orangeville, Utah. Coal mining has [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=409.36s)]
*  always been dangerous. One of the deadliest professions in the nation. 119 coal miners were [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=414.88s)]
*  killed in a mine explosion. The new monument dedicated to the men who died from that tragedy. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=421.04s)]
*  In the 20th century, more than 100,000 workers died in the U.S. mining industry. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=426.88s)]
*  Christopher Mark experienced that risk firsthand. I started the mines in 1976 was almost 50 years [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=433.84s)]
*  ago and I worked underground all together for about two years and I can tell you I was almost [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=440.56s)]
*  killed a couple of times. So this is real for you. Mine safety. Absolutely. Mine safety has been [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=445.68s)]
*  Mark's life's work. In his twenties, he left the coal fields to earn a. I think we should fire this [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=450.4s)]
*  guy. PhD then returned. Man seems like he has an important seems like he has an important role to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=456.4s)]
*  serve in the federal government. Let's see where this goes. As an engineer for the federal government, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=463.76s)]
*  his efforts have helped save countless lives underground. It was still maybe a coal miner [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=470.4s)]
*  every week that was being killed in a rockfall. In 2016, we had our first year with zero, a really [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=476.32s)]
*  tremendous accomplishment. At the end of the day, you work essentially for the worker, not for the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=482.48s)]
*  corporations. That's exactly right. And we were asked to do this by the public. It was the public's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=487.76s)]
*  demand that was reflected in the laws that were passed by Congress. And that's all we've been [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  doing ever since. So for you, this isn't just about a government budget. This is life and death. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=498.48s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. Of course, that's an issue that we met Christopher Mark in the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=504.24s)]
*  historic coal country of western Pennsylvania. He agreed to speak with us as a private citizen, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=508.96s)]
*  not as a representative of his employer, the Department of Labor. His reason? He is deeply [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=515.04s)]
*  concerned about the Trump administration's sweeping criticism of federal workers. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=521.04s)]
*  I still have the most precious American right, which is the right to free speech. So long as I'm [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=525.68s)]
*  speaking in my own personal capacity. So that's what I'm doing today. So you're not afraid? I'd be [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=532.16s)]
*  foolish if I wasn't afraid. I campaigned on the fact that I said government is corrupt. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=538.64s)]
*  And it is very corrupt. It's very, very, it's also foolish. Since taking office, President Trump has [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=543.68s)]
*  enlisted billionaire industrialist Elon Musk as a special government employee. And they have launched [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=551.84s)]
*  a crusade to winnow the ranks of federal workers, encouraging more than 2 million of them to consider [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  quitting and moving to shutter entire agencies. Meanwhile, there are reports that hundreds of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=566.4s)]
*  thousands of recently hired federal employees could soon be terminated. You couldn't ask for [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=573.52s)]
*  a stronger mandate from the public. The public voted for not you, but okay. Do you have a majority [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=579.92s)]
*  of the public vote voting for President Trump? Trump and Musk's campaign has sparked anger. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=590.08s)]
*  We are out here trying, but we need every American to care because this will impact every American. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=597.84s)]
*  It has also forced a reckoning over what Americans want from their government. I think as we speak, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=605.92s)]
*  our country is getting an education of what its government does because it feels it has to. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=614.08s)]
*  Who knew what USAID was three weeks ago? In an upcoming book, bestselling author Michael Lewis [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=617.92s)]
*  poses the question, who is government? Virtually every existential risk we face, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=624.24s)]
*  we don't turn to the private sector to respond to it. We turn to the government. I mean, the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  federal government's mission is to keep us safe. And you don't really know that that insurance [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  policy is not there until it isn't. The book is based on a Washington Post series Lewis edited [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=642.48s)]
*  last year with little known stories of federal workers. Just look at Christopher Mark's life [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=649.2s)]
*  work. If you just removed Christopher Mark from the history of the federal government, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=655.12s)]
*  thousands of coal miners are dead. It's one person. Profiling military cemetery managers [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=659.44s)]
*  and mission specialists for space exploration, Lewis and his co-authors make the case that claims [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=666.32s)]
*  of an impersonal so-called... I don't like Trump personally, but it's kind of funny how he's most [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=673.76s)]
*  likely unknowingly dismantling the US state and its influence. Yeah. Yeah, no, he is destroying [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=678.96s)]
*  the American empire piece by piece. Okay. He is doing it. He's accelerating the demise of [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=686.0s)]
*  the American empire. It's not even wishful thinking. Like there is, it is literally what's [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=694.56s)]
*  happening. I just think that it's not going to stop the pain on the global South. That's it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=699.3599999999999s)]
*  I don't think undermining all of these, undermining all of these very important [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=708.4s)]
*  functions of the federal government and the regulatory bodies is actually going to stop [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=714.8s)]
*  America from successfully destroying the global South. Like I joke about JD pond on or whatever, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  but like notice how he hasn't really touched the DOD. Like sure. He put a weird Christian nationalist [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=727.28s)]
*  psychopath in charge of it. And I'm sure that that will lead to some complications down the line. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  But I just, I think you underestimate the resilience of the empire. He just grew in [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=744.0s)]
*  America's. No, that's what I'm saying. No, that is what that is. My point. Like I joke, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=746.96s)]
*  when I say JD pond on he's like, he's destroying the, the, the state department apparatus for like [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  destabilizing foreign nations or whatever. But the reality of the matter is there is obviously [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=758.32s)]
*  great utility, great use for those tools. So he's not going to actually cast it aside in its entirety. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  He's just going to, I think, change the trajectory of American empire and make it more violent, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=771.44s)]
*  most likely. Deep state are off base. And that while there may be places for trims and updated [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=779.28s)]
*  systems, they argue the federal workforce is largely individuals dedicated to the public good. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=787.76s)]
*  Is this an intentional crippling of American empire for a specific purpose, or is this really [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=796.16s)]
*  truly just pure stupidity on Donnie's part? I think it's not pure stupidity on Donald's part. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=799.84s)]
*  I don't think it's Donald Trump doing this alone. I think it's pure stupidity of the entire [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=805.2s)]
*  capitalist apparatus that is salivating at the prospect of undermining the federal government, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=810.72s)]
*  because this is the libertarian dream. I think it's stupid in the sense that it's short-sighted, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=818.0s)]
*  because it will lead to tremendous, tremendous profits for the private sector in the short term, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=824.96s)]
*  because someone has to do these jobs. Who's going to do these jobs? Oh, that's right. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=831.12s)]
*  Private enterprise. And obviously when the private-public partnership turns basically [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=835.9200000000001s)]
*  all of these other government operations into a money sink, when private capital gets to paywall [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=844.32s)]
*  incredibly important things like the National Weather Service, for example, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=853.9200000000001s)]
*  what are you going to do? Not know the weather? How are you going to do like you need it for [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=858.96s)]
*  everything you need? Like the National Weather Service is a great example of this. Okay. This [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=864.32s)]
*  is something that psychopathic Rothbardian libertarians and just libertarians alike have [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=868.48s)]
*  fantasized about. Okay. When they're not thinking about like the marketplace of babies, they've [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=875.0400000000001s)]
*  wanted to do this for a long time. And why do they want to do this? Because it is a profoundly [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=882.24s)]
*  important, it's a profoundly important thing that needs to exist, a service that needs to exist. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  It literally works with the GPS. Okay. It is incredibly important for commerce. You need to [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=893.6s)]
*  know what the fuck the weather is. Okay. You need to know the weather patterns. So while he's [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=898.72s)]
*  talking about DI or the fakeness of climate change or whatever, and that's the reason why [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=904.96s)]
*  they're going to dismantle the National Weather Service, the real goal there is to basically make [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=909.12s)]
*  that a private enterprise. When it becomes a private enterprise, that you can basically paywall [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=913.6s)]
*  the service and charge it, like charge whatever price you want for it, for all of the other [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=919.84s)]
*  companies, for everyone that needs it. Whoever takes on the National Weather Service that, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=926.8s)]
*  once it's inevitably privatized, will be able to make tremendous profits off of it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=933.28s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. Their goal is basically to privatize everything. Yes. We are doing to ourselves what [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=939.36s)]
*  we have done to the global south in perpetuity. We are applying shock doctrine to America. Okay. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=944.64s)]
*  And we're doing it for incredibly nearsighted, incredible focus on short-term profits. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=953.28s)]
*  It's people who have been attracted to a problem. The government is there to solve lots of problems, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=959.12s)]
*  usually problems that the market doesn't want to solve. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=964.72s)]
*  Some people say government should run like a business. Are they right? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=967.6s)]
*  No, they're wrong. I don't see how you would run the government as a business because [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=972.32s)]
*  the kind of problems the government is addressing, they're addressing it because you can't make money [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=976.5600000000001s)]
*  addressing it. The modern federal government took shape almost a century ago in response to the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=981.0400000000001s)]
*  Great Depression. FDR's New Deal, followed by World War II, expanded government's reach into most [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=987.84s)]
*  every aspect of life. And since then, many conservatives have been pushing back. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=995.76s)]
*  The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and- [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1001.68s)]
*  Devil. Shaitan. Shaitan. The devil. Okay. Look at this devil, man. This fucking demon, dude. Oh, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1009.12s)]
*  oh my God. And I'm here to help. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan helped lay the foundation [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1019.84s)]
*  for what Trump and Musk are doing today. There is an ethos in Silicon Valley, move fast, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1028.16s)]
*  break things, disrupt. You've covered leaders in that sector for decades. Does that approach, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1034.96s)]
*  though, work when it comes to the federal government and the stakes are different? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1041.6s)]
*  It doesn't work very well. If you take the kind of Elon Musk approach to the federal government, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1046.16s)]
*  walking in, as he did at Twitter, and say, all you people are useless, we're going to get rid [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1050.96s)]
*  of half of you, operating with kind of fear and chaos, I don't think any big institution [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1056.0s)]
*  is going to respond well to the like move fast and break things approach. When asked for comment, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1061.76s)]
*  a White House spokesman said the president is confident in Musk and his ability to shake things [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1068.64s)]
*  up and said criticism of his method is fear mongering. Trump people don't necessarily say [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1074.8s)]
*  there's a federal worker. That's right. They say that's a coal miner. That's my friend. That's [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1081.2s)]
*  someone who works on mine safety. They're not thinking about you necessarily as part of the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1086.0s)]
*  federal government. That's right. That doesn't help the federal government. Another thing is [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1090.72s)]
*  that the federal government doesn't have money to advertise itself. That's right. You know, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1095.44s)]
*  people can say whatever they want about us and we really can't respond. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1099.44s)]
*  For mine safety engineer Christopher Mark, there is little he can do to stave off the wave of [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1104.32s)]
*  changes from Washington. But he says he'll carry on his head up as long as he can. If you could [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1110.8s)]
*  bring Elon Musk down to the mines, what would you say to him? Well, I would say, you know, there's [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1119.12s)]
*  a lot of people that have to work in these mines and they deserve to be able to come home at the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1125.2s)]
*  end of the shift to their families safely. And we're a part of making that happen. You can't take [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1130.48s)]
*  us out of the equation and be sure that they're going to return home safely to their families. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1135.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, mine safety engineers are an unnecessary redundancy. Yes, we're about to be working [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1139.52s)]
*  Victorian child conditions. I mean, you have [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vE0mVJ3gjo&t=1144.3200000000002s)]
