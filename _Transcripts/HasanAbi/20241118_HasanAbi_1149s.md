# Revealing The Truth Behind Adpocalypse | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0)
*  I took off the election tag and guess what happened? My money came back. So sorry, drama [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=0.0s)]
*  frogs who are like, this is an apocalypse. No, it's not. I don't know how to explain [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=5.24s)]
*  this basically, but yeah, anything that is like even remotely political remotely considered [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  political is now automatically, it seems qualifying you as like a political content creator. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=15.56s)]
*  Let's get started. Before we get to some serious news, let's get started with a brief update [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=27.6s)]
*  on, on the adpocalypse, the impending doom on twitch.tv. If you've been following for [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=32.56s)]
*  the past couple of months, there has been a bunch of communities that have been actively [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  trying to get some news coverage and some momentum surrounding this platform that we're [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=45.32s)]
*  on being really ironic. Ironically enough, they're on YouTube and on kick for the most [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  part. Oh shit. Here we go again. I mean, it's not, it's not, Oh shit. Here we go again. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=55.08s)]
*  I'm just like going to briefly go through it and explain some stuff. There has been, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=60.92s)]
*  there's been a deliberate effort to, to basically go to every, there is a deliberate effort [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=67.0s)]
*  to go to basically every single advertiser that advertises on Twitch. Please, you know, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=74.92s)]
*  advertising on this platform. They've been doing this for quite a while to limited success. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=82.92s)]
*  And this is also alongside the initiatives to go to ADL directly to try to get the ADL to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=89.72s)]
*  add new restrictions on what you can and can't say on this platform, including, but not limited to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=97.4s)]
*  content classification labels that were implemented. I use them right now. That's why it says sensitive [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=101.96s)]
*  content when I talk and also the, the new additional qualifications for each, including, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=106.76s)]
*  but not limited saying, you know, saying Zionist. Now you can still talk about Zionism and the new [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=115.48s)]
*  restrictions, but you can't, you can't say, you know, Zionist insert animal, for example, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  like that's something you cannot say. Okay. Now that's it's, you know, it's a, it's a clear cut [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=129.72s)]
*  caving into capitulation to outside organizations, but you know, it is what it is. I'd love for you [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=137.64s)]
*  to talk to pirate software about this. He's been getting fooled by Lacey misgive clips. Yeah. So [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=144.84s)]
*  what's interesting about it is that there were some content creators, including, but not limited [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=150.36s)]
*  to the stock guy and Lacey and many other people like phase Lacey phase, Ronaldo, the stock guy, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=154.36s)]
*  and, and numerous other content creators who had said that they were noticing like a severe revenue [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=165.88000000000002s)]
*  loss. Right. I think Moon Moon had said something about it as well. And some of these guys were [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=170.68s)]
*  basically, some of these guys were basically a memeing, like they were just meta chasing, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=176.44000000000003s)]
*  which is what happens. And then there was also very real, there were very real instances of people [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=181.48s)]
*  losing all of their advertising revenue, like case on who's also another phase member case on his [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  Iranian. I had a conversation with them directly, if you remember, and he had Iranian as a tag, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  he had Iranian as a tag on his, on his Twitch profile for the longest time, because he's Iranian [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=198.76s)]
*  and he wants Iranian people to come and watch him. And basically they had just, or no Iran [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=206.2s)]
*  as a tag. Sorry. Basically Twitch just removed all of their advertising revenue and didn't serve [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=212.44s)]
*  any ads on his, on his page specifically because it Iran is a tag. Same with Venezuela, which I [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=219.56s)]
*  think is really, you know, it's really fucked up overall. But the point is all of this is happening [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  because Twitch is caving to outside pressure coming from, you know, these organizations like [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=233.0s)]
*  the ADL and, and hoping that like advertisers don't just like run away from the platform [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=239.08s)]
*  because these guys are pretty aggressively pursuing that. And all everything, everything is coming [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=244.68s)]
*  from like an incredibly cynical place. Obviously these are like kick streamers that are conducting [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=251.24s)]
*  this mass brigading campaign. Ironically enough. And as I say, this is someone who is a quote, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=257.24s)]
*  unquote woke, right? Who has been on every platform from Facebook to YouTube, to Instagram, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=263.88s)]
*  to tick-tock to Twitch, that Twitch of course has the most restrictive terms of service out of all [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=271.08s)]
*  of these other websites. They do a fantastic job with that, which is why it's ironic that these other [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=279.64s)]
*  platforms where there is no real rigorous application of terms of service can turn around [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=284.52s)]
*  and be like, these guys are actually the real anti-Semites. I promise. Don't look at us, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=289.64s)]
*  look at them and pull your ads. So it's a weird, you know, it's a weird situation overall, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=293.32s)]
*  but I think a lot of people were a little confused. And originally the stock guy had said [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=300.84s)]
*  that he had seen a severe loss of revenue and he didn't understand what was going on, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=305.56s)]
*  but it turns out the severe loss of revenue came from the fact that he had an election tag from [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  his stream because he was covering the election. I went to my tags and my tags were, you know, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=313.88s)]
*  my normal tags, but I had a tag that said election because I had covered the market's reaction to the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=320.76s)]
*  election, not politics, not personal politics, not, not policy, just the market's reaction. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=327.08s)]
*  And so Friday before stream, I decided to take that tag off. I took off veteran as well, just in case. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=332.84s)]
*  And guess what? It came back. Yeah. So there's not a f**king adpocalypse. I never said there was an [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  adpocalypse. I said that I'm being affected by other people's s**t. And so what did I do? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  I took off the election tag and guess what happened? My money came back. So sorry, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  drama frogs who were like, this is an adpocalypse. No, it's not. No, it's not. It is a advertising [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=354.36s)]
*  thing that is happening with a specific subset on the platform. And I took it off and guess what? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=359.88000000000005s)]
*  I'm back. I so are there any real reports of people, the LGBTQ tags losing ends as well? I [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=365.0s)]
*  haven't seen that, but the Iran Persian tags also lower the revenue. If you remember Saeed from no [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=370.36s)]
*  pixel RP had his ad revenue lower from three K a month to one K. Then he removed them today. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=375.64s)]
*  Tomorrow's revenue should be better. There's an example. If you want to use, yeah, it's, it's, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=379.4s)]
*  it's basically, it's basically people, it's basically people just like trying to navigate [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=383.96s)]
*  this space to the best of their ability. When I don't know how to explain this basically, but [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=390.76s)]
*  yeah, anything that is like even remotely political, remotely considered political [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=399.0s)]
*  is now automatically, it seems qualifying you as like a political content creator. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=403.8s)]
*  And if you are in that political content creator category, it seems like they still haven't, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=409.24s)]
*  because it's a new category, they automatically don't have ads on that category. They will [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=414.28s)]
*  eventually have ads on that category as well, but because the new category, they haven't started [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  serving ads to that category. But right now, as it stands, there's no ads. If you are doing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  political commentary now, of course it doesn't, it, you know, this doesn't bother me at all because [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=431.4s)]
*  knowing that this is, this was always an inevitable possibility. I have always worked on [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=439.88s)]
*  ensuring that I have that, that my primary revenue source is subscribers. You guys, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=446.52s)]
*  I don't work with advertisers that I don't feel like I want to work with. I don't work with [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  advertisers usually anyway. And this is, you know, a part of that. So I'm a firm believer that the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=457.4s)]
*  political tag should not be monetized by ads because this channel could be ad free. Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  Overall, I think it's really, I mean, it's really frustrating in general, but this is part of the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=468.84s)]
*  reason why for years and years I have maintained the position that it's like a much better way to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=474.68s)]
*  have editorial control and have more freedom with what you can and can't say if you are to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=481.56s)]
*  work with a base of subscribers rather than rely on, you know, running ads. Thank you. Majority [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=488.68s)]
*  report for the rate. Hope you had a good stream. It's, it's very frustrating though, for smaller [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=495.4s)]
*  content creators who are up and coming, who are in this space, who want to, you know, generate income [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=499.64s)]
*  for themselves or have been relying on the income for themselves. I think it's like, it's really [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=505.4s)]
*  messed up that those guys end up getting over by this process. It, as is the case with everything [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=511.32s)]
*  else, like this only harms smaller content creators, but of course, seemingly no one gives a shit [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=519.3199999999999s)]
*  about them. And it's very, very, very frustrating. But overall, you know, advertisers don't really look [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=524.2s)]
*  at anything super seriously. They don't want any sort of, they don't want any sort of motion. Like [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=533.32s)]
*  they don't, they're not going to like, they're not going to assess the situation and be like, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=539.24s)]
*  is this cynical or is this serious? They're not going to do that. Right. This doesn't mean there [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=544.6s)]
*  isn't a concerted brigade effort cynically mass spamming emails, the advertisers urging them to pull [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=549.48s)]
*  ads. There very clearly is one, ironically enough, it's being led by kick streamers who happen to have [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=552.92s)]
*  a contract with kick. Very interesting predicament. So that is the case here. That's what's going on [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=556.92s)]
*  here. But yeah, so far there hasn't been any like real, so far there hasn't been any real [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=562.52s)]
*  evidence as to this being like a mass adpocalypse. But I mean, look, I'm not, I know how advertisers [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=569.4799999999999s)]
*  work, right? I'm, I'm familiar with how advertisers work. I worked in advertising. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=576.76s)]
*  I know that when they hear any sort of drama or any sort of controversy, they're going to be like, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=582.12s)]
*  Oh, I don't want my brand associated with that. I don't even give a shit what it is. Right. Nobody [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=587.16s)]
*  until it's like black lives matter, a protest happening all around the, all around the nation, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=591.8s)]
*  you're never going to see a marketing campaign that, you know, puts politics in the forefront. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=598.84s)]
*  Okay. So for that reason, I think the CCL designation isn't necessarily bad. Like the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=606.12s)]
*  new content classification label for politics is not bad because I think it partitions off [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  political commentary in a separate space on this platform. I think it's bad in the interim period [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=616.84s)]
*  and it's bad because like, of course, when they apply something like this, randomly people catch [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=622.12s)]
*  strays like case on and like some others, but overall making sure that this kind of content [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=627.96s)]
*  still exists, as long as it does not violate clear cut, you know, hate speech boundaries, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=635.88s)]
*  this kind of content existing in a separate category that is sheltered from the rest of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=644.36s)]
*  the advertising that's running on the platform is a good thing. Okay. It's, it's not a, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=650.9200000000001s)]
*  it's not necessarily a bad thing at all because I don't want content critters on this platform to, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=657.32s)]
*  I don't want content critters on this platform to like lose out on revenue opportunities for [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=662.84s)]
*  themselves. Right. I don't, I want them to keep making money and make a career out of this sort [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=667.16s)]
*  of thing. And I think it's ridiculous that, I think it's ridiculous that like there are [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=674.36s)]
*  people who are championing this cause. So yeah, Trump has declared a national or said he's going [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=681.4000000000001s)]
*  to do a national emergency. Is there anything Twitch can do vis-a-vis people representing [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=686.36s)]
*  kick like a co-founder or a contract to talent on their platform regarding Twitch advertisers in this [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=690.44s)]
*  way? I think Twitch just needs to do PR, right? They need to do more PR to, to combat this like [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=693.72s)]
*  ridiculous narrative, but I don't know, you know, I don't know what they're doing overall. Is the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=701.8800000000001s)]
*  apocalypse both a subsequent issue because of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism? No, Islamophobia [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=708.44s)]
*  is not a reason for the apocalypse. I don't think it's a reason for the apocalypse of anything. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=713.32s)]
*  Asmongold being banned primed his audience to maybe take action and join the cause [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=718.2s)]
*  and join other communities that were already brigading. But there is no real like, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=723.64s)]
*  as far as I know, as far as I understand so far, there is no real adpocalypse. Okay. A lot of the [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=728.76s)]
*  content creators that said that they reported loss of like massive loss of revenue have either [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=734.6s)]
*  openly admitted that they were farming, joking, or whatever the f**k. There was a clip from, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=740.36s)]
*  there was a clip from specifically, Max Faze, PlacBoyMax, who was talking about how like Lacey [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=746.36s)]
*  and Ron are just clip farming and they shouldn't do that because they shouldn't do that because [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=755.72s)]
*  there's people like Kason who are legitimately experiencing like a loss of revenue because they're [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=761.0799999999999s)]
*  catching strays. Here it is. Yeah. Literally got demonetized because of who he is. Soda X. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=767.0s)]
*  Now Twitch, fix that too. See, because I don't want to start no problems and it's not that big of a [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=772.52s)]
*  deal to start problems. But, and when this rage bait type s**t happens, when this happens, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=777.8s)]
*  it causes people to take Kason's situation less serious. When it's actually something serious, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=782.76s)]
*  he didn't get money for no reason. So please be aware of that. Okay. Ron, I don't know Ron s**t, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=786.76s)]
*  but this is, he's rage baiting. Okay. This is not serious. Ron rage baited too. That's also not [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=792.76s)]
*  serious. Please don't take these n****s serious. And it kind of make it be little Kason situation [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=797.4s)]
*  or if X go through it when it is serious, they didn't get paid. You know, like Kason, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=801.4s)]
*  dead a** is going through that. So yes, please, please Twitch. Kason, little- [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=807.4s)]
*  Yeah. Ron wasn't clip farming. Twitch had the political tag on his stream because he was [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=812.3599999999999s)]
*  watching the election. Oh, okay. Anyway. Did you see Ludwig's video about this? I thought it was [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=815.64s)]
*  more serious than it is after watching this, watching his video. Yeah. I didn't watch Ludwig's [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=820.84s)]
*  video on this at all, but I also know more than he does on this issue. I'm on the platform. I [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=825.48s)]
*  talked to other content creators on the platform and I'm also very like, I am probably the other [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=831.88s)]
*  than like destiny and, and Dan Saltman, the people who have conducted this campaign and maybe to a [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=837.96s)]
*  certain degree, Ethan Klein, I am probably the most knowledgeable party on what is actually [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=843.96s)]
*  happening. So yeah, no, I don't see any reason of it. I don't see any reason to watch Ludwig's video [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=849.48s)]
*  where it very clearly is like uninformed, especially considering that he himself was, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=855.5600000000001s)]
*  was duped by a misgiv clip farm that he, I guess, deleted as well from his YouTube video. I was like [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  learned about yesterday morning. So, you know, no disrespect. I love Lud, Ludwig is the goat. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=870.12s)]
*  And I find it very funny that people find it in their heart to hate on a guy when he is basically [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=877.0s)]
*  a golden retriever. Straightforwardly, he is one of the most mathematically likable people on the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  planet. So whenever people get mad at him, I'm like, that's insane. Like you have to be so far [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=889.24s)]
*  off base to just be like hating on this fucking guy. Like he is, he's a dork. He's funny. And he [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=895.64s)]
*  is a well-natured person. It is wild to get mad at him. It just feels weird. So that's neither here [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=903.8s)]
*  nor there, but I think it says a lot about people. I also work in advertising with the council, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=911.48s)]
*  spend millions a month. You're right that execs won't do any due diligence and touch platforms [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=915.8s)]
*  that have any sort of controversy. Exactly. But I think like, I think like the platform taking [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=919.0s)]
*  actions to just say like, no, this kind of content exists on the platform, but in a totally separate [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=925.64s)]
*  vacuum is an appropriate thing to do because then they can go back to advertising and be like, yeah, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=929.8s)]
*  this kind of stuff is whatever. It's neither here nor there. We don't, here's our terms of service. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=935.24s)]
*  We don't allow any sort of like extremist sentiment. And also even then we have different [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=939.8s)]
*  content classification labels. There's like international standards for this sort of stuff, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=945.48s)]
*  some of which is very, some of which is very strict and is like straightforwardly anti-free [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=949.48s)]
*  speech. And I think, I think for them, they're just doing their very best to, to work through [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=955.48s)]
*  this process. There's the same conversation that happened with smush streamers. Yeah. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=966.84s)]
*  Yeah. Except that didn't really, that didn't, they didn't take it to that level with the [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=971.32s)]
*  difference between the difference between what's going on right now versus like hot tub streamers [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=978.9200000000001s)]
*  is that there wasn't one group of people. There wasn't one group of people that were like clipping, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=985.1600000000001s)]
*  you know, Amaran streamer or whatever, and sending it to every advertiser to be like, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=991.0s)]
*  Oh Doritos, your ads are running against these, you know, these, these hot tub streamers. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=995.64s)]
*  Do you feel like it's appropriate? You know, do you feel like it's appropriate to, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1002.4399999999999s)]
*  and then lie basically to like in this circumstance, they would have to lie as well and [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1007.0799999999999s)]
*  claim that they're doing nudity or whatever. And not just like in a hot tub, if they were to do that, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1011.3199999999999s)]
*  then I'm sure there would have been a similar level of motion to that as well. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1016.04s)]
*  Yeah. And Congress people were not, you know, writing with the congressional letterhead, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1019.72s)]
*  letters to Twitch talking about an Amazon talking about like Amaranth's Amaranth's hot tub streams [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1024.76s)]
*  must be put to an end or whatever. Are you thinking of taking a break from Twitch? All [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1031.4s)]
*  this controversy must be exhausting, especially after being on Twitch for so many years. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1035.4s)]
*  Fuck no. I love how everybody think you got Lovery to remove a part of his video, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1038.44s)]
*  though you never even watched it. Yeah. That part is that part of the conversation is somewhat [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1041.96s)]
*  tangentially related to what I'm talking about here as well. But that is just an unfortunate [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1048.76s)]
*  byproduct of easily brigatable subreddits that still play somewhat of a formative role in the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1054.76s)]
*  way that people understand what's going on in the platform. Everyone is busy. This is a principle [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1060.84s)]
*  that I've held on held on to for a very long time. Everyone's busy. So they don't have time to like [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1065.48s)]
*  investigate this stuff thoroughly. And so when enough people can go and brigade a subreddit, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1070.28s)]
*  where like people can just like quickly try to figure out what the fuck's going on, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1076.28s)]
*  and every single comment is like aligned in a certain perspective, then yeah, of course, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1079.4s)]
*  people are not going to look into it a little bit. They're not going to look into it any further. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1085.72s)]
*  They're just going to take it for granted that like I hold the purse for Twitch. I hold the, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1089.72s)]
*  I'm the puppeteer of Twitch and also simultaneously am the reason why there is an [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  apocalypse happening because I'm a lover of terrorism and also massive anti-Semite. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1101.24s)]
*  Now, of course, all of that is untrue, but it doesn't really matter. I speak for eight to [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1110.1200000000001s)]
*  10 hours a day. You can clip me out of context to make it seem like I'm on board with anything, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1114.2s)]
*  really, at that point, I talk about a litany of different issues. So it is what it is. But I do [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1119.96s)]
*  think that, you know, even people who could have had like direct access to someone like myself to [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1126.44s)]
*  ask me what they think is going on, like Ludwig, can sometimes get duped by mischief, clip farming, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1132.8400000000001s)]
*  and trying to get a upvoted Reddit post on LSF. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V88BKe3zt0&t=1141.72s)]
