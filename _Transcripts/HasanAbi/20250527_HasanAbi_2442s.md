# SpaceX Starship Flight 9 Launch Is WILD | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4)
*  Thank you. Now, I want to preface one thing, okay? If you see the vacuum raptors shutting down [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=0.0s)]
*  while the satyrs are still ongoing... I think it's crazy that I can get real-time footage from a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=7.36s)]
*  goddamn spaceship out in goddamn space, okay? And we have that level of internet, but my stream [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=13.36s)]
*  with regular frequency in the heart of Los Angeles. It does not make sense. Space check, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=23.84s)]
*  space testing, spaceship again after the booster and the ship failures, the cryogenic propellant [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  cold. They do have some time. And again, this is the moment when they're in the control room [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=36.32s)]
*  and they're doing these checkouts of the ship. They're looking, they want to make sure everything [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=41.44s)]
*  is green. This thing up. I mean, you say that jokingly, but that was the unironic reaction [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=44.96s)]
*  to this statement. I mean, I know. I know. Up to T minus one minute. Why are you using this hold [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=48.24s)]
*  T minus 40 to do additional checkouts of booster, boosters, will it fail again? Gamba. These raptors [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=55.52s)]
*  are going to be flying for a second time. You might want to make extra sure that they're going [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=61.84s)]
*  to be good to go in the final moments leading up to launch, which we're coming up 10 seconds away [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=66.88s)]
*  from that. We will see. Sorry. 28. Yeah. One for a third time. Thank you, Adrian. Which is awesome. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=71.28s)]
*  I appreciate being nitpicked in that way because I would do it to you. Oh yeah, absolutely. So we're [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=80.8s)]
*  in a hold now. We're in a hold. We're in a hold. That's fine. Starship is not like Falcon 9. As [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  we've said, it does use a sort of densified propellants a little bit, but it's not the same [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=92.48s)]
*  as Falcon 9. There's so much propellant mass. There's so much volume there that they have a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=98.16s)]
*  little bit more time before they can, before things start to warm up to a point. Let's go to the future. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  There's the T minus 40 seconds optional hold that is taken. Yeah. And as of right now, the vehicle [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=108.8s)]
*  and the ship, they're fully loaded. They're doing those final checkouts. And this is really important [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=115.84s)]
*  for those raptors because they're eventually going to go to 35. And we want to make sure, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=119.52s)]
*  I mean, they got to make sure, like you said, 28 of these are flown twice. Go ahead. We'll see [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=125.12s)]
*  if they reach 35. I want to say one thing though. Be on the lookout because if they clear the hold, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=130.88s)]
*  it can be very quickly. Remember it's 40 seconds, right? Be on the lookout because sometimes the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=138.4s)]
*  information from SpaceX might be delayed. Even 10 seconds of delay, that's already a quarter of the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=144.8s)]
*  way to T zero, right? So we should be on the lookout as well for what is happening at the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=150.4s)]
*  launch pad. If we hear certain vents or the, yeah, the ternation system activating and things like [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=154.8s)]
*  that, that is an indication that they have cleared, right? And so just making sure, because 40 seconds [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=161.36s)]
*  might seem like an eternity, but it's very quickly. It's a very certain vent we are here, like Alex is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=167.76s)]
*  listening for right now and I'm listening for it now. Yep. Here we go. Good luck. There we go. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=175.28s)]
*  Guys, T minus 30 seconds. You're going to see the fire suppression system, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=181.84s)]
*  then the deluge, and we're going to stop there. Go for launch. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=186.4s)]
*  Hold. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=205.84s)]
*  All right. No big deal. Again, they have the ability to hold a little bit. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=212.4s)]
*  Yeah. So do they recycle? Here's a question. Do they recycle it back to the T40? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=217.2s)]
*  If it is before deluge activation, yes. If not, then that will be the S word, but I'm not going to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=222.32s)]
*  say it. Right. It does look like the deluge has not activated. Yeah. It doesn't look like it activated. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=227.68s)]
*  They could still try today again. Did the detonation suppression system activate? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but they have multiple tries for that one. Okay. They have multiple charges of that. Okay. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=240.16s)]
*  Cool. Cool. Yeah. In theory, they should be able to be good with that. So again, you're watching [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=243.83999999999997s)]
*  live launch coverage of Starship Flight 9. Both booster and ship are fully loaded. They held at [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  40 seconds. The clock continued to move. They're gone. Ground site issue. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=255.44000000000003s)]
*  We are awaiting the activation of the water deluge system and the fire suppression system [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=262.88s)]
*  underneath the OLM. Yeah. They're working on whatever that exactly means, but they're working [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  on a ground site issue. That could be, for example, I'm just spilling things here. For example, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=274.72s)]
*  the ground site of the Raptor start because they ground site start some of the Raptors. That could [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=280.32s)]
*  be one of the ground site issues here. It could be some last minute of the QD issues. That's the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=286.4s)]
*  kind of ground site things we are talking about here. That could be potentially an issue here, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=293.68s)]
*  but we are probably getting more information at some point. Remember to breathe, everyone. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=298.88s)]
*  Thank you for that. Yeah, thank you for that. My face is turning red. Remember. Go ahead. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=304.24s)]
*  Go ahead. No, I was going to say SpaceX calls the ground support equipment stage zero. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=310.56s)]
*  It's just as important that that work every time 100% the way we want it to. That is just as [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=315.44s)]
*  rapidly reusable going forward as the ship and the booster itself. So this is very important [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=320.96s)]
*  as they look at this issue. This is not a ship issue. This is not a booster issue. This is a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=327.04s)]
*  stage zero. This is such a gross oversimplification, but if you have ever made a model rocket and set it [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=331.84s)]
*  off but it doesn't go off the little launch pad thing right and kind of just goes sideways or [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  just sits there and doesn't do anything and the parachute pops out all set, you don't want that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=343.52s)]
*  You want the ground support equipment to work properly. Yeah, I mean, we have all been to a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  Fourth of July or have seen a firework that you hit the launch button or light the fuse, the fuse [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=356.0s)]
*  disappears and you're sitting there like, oh, now what do we walk up to it? So they're working [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=360.48s)]
*  these issues and we are just like you on the edge of our seats. We are waiting for word from SpaceX [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  that they're going to recycle to a 40 second hold. They have some time or keep going. We're looking [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  for the fire suppression system and the deluge system. Go ahead, Jack. What do we have left in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=380.48s)]
*  the window like 55 minutes? How long is the window, Adrian? Yeah, we have. Yeah, I was going to say [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=385.52s)]
*  but now that they have loaded propellant, the hold time is like 15-20 minutes. It's not that long. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  Got it. Oh, wow. They're still looking at all of the systems and everything. Is this the longest [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  they've ever held in a Starship count? Maybe. No. Maybe only because I'm always on the field. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=406.96s)]
*  We had like a 10 minute hold somewhere. I'm trying to remember but I think we are, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=414.48s)]
*  one of the earlier flights, we had like a 10 minute or so hold. Again, they have some options here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  Let's not, we are not yet in a... Yeah, they've got time. They've got time. And of course, this is the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=430.8s)]
*  obligatory point in the launch broadcast where I say you'd rather be on the ground wishing [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  you're in space than being in space or in the air, wishing you were on the ground. Of course, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=444.16s)]
*  we all want to see the thing happen at the designated time but ultimately rocket science is [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=450.16s)]
*  super, super complicated. That's why they call it rocket science. It's not brain surgery but it is [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=456.24s)]
*  rocket science. So you want to make sure what is essentially your giant fuel tanks and very fancy [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=461.68s)]
*  plumbing is going to work properly. And if it's not looking it's going to work properly, then [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=467.12s)]
*  you need to fix it. Okay, clock rolling. Clock's rolling? Yep. So now we watch for the DSS. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=474.24s)]
*  We're going to watch for the... Yep. Watch the bottom part of the stack. There it is. There it is. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=480.72s)]
*  Fire suppression. There it is. Watch for the deluge. Let's see. Oh my god, here we go. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=486.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=500.56s)]
*  Is it wobbly? I feel like its direction seems off. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=504.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=534.16s)]
*  That thing's sipping on lean. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=558.64s)]
*  Get your expert brother on here news boy. He's busy bro. He's busy building rockets. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=565.44s)]
*  Is this man? I don't think so. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=580.24s)]
*  No, it's a test launch, right? Is Oprah on this rocket? No, no one's on it. Dude, oh my god, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=588.24s)]
*  it'd be sweet if Elon was on it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=596.0s)]
*  You can see 33 healthy Raptor engines as flight nine takes off and it's on its way uphill. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=605.92s)]
*  A beautiful launch guys. Absolutely amazing audio as we are through max Q and approaching [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=612.32s)]
*  stage separation. Keep your eye on it. You'll see the stage separation through the amazing tracking. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=618.88s)]
*  Is this DOS? I'm assuming this is DOS with this amazing tracking wave. Based on the angle, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=625.6s)]
*  I think it's either DOS or gauge. I'm not sure. I would be willing to wager DOS. But you're right, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=629.2800000000001s)]
*  Gene. 33 healthy Raptor engines. That's so important to point out as so many of these are [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=634.08s)]
*  being reused. And that's the first thing I noticed on liftoff. They look good. I see a bright [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=639.12s)]
*  circle there with no dim spots. What you're gonna see now is most- The big ticket items are coming. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=643.52s)]
*  The big ticket items are still coming. You might notice the rocket is in a different attitude now. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=648.96s)]
*  It has rolled for the hot staging and the directional flip. Here we go. There's most [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=655.44s)]
*  engines cut off. There we go. Space X-Treme a little delayed. It's fine. Yep. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=661.28s)]
*  There it is. Wow, you could even see them throttled down before Miko. That was cool. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=669.28s)]
*  Hot staging. There's the flip. Oh, that goes up. It is going up. And goodbye booster. Also, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=675.12s)]
*  six healthy engines on- Yep. 13 for boost back as well. 13 healthy engines for boost back. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=683.68s)]
*  Guys, this is gonna be a rough ride for booster 14-2. Just pay attention. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=689.92s)]
*  We need- Look. Engine bay cam! Yes! Yes! Healthy engines taking starship. Wait, did they label [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=693.92s)]
*  the Raptors without serial numbers but with what engine number they are? No, they have both. They [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=702.48s)]
*  have both. Okay. Okay. Yeah. We come back to our tracking of the boosters. It's going down now. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  God, they're nutty. Okay. This is gonna be a steeper trajectory or- That made bros wet, dude. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=712.0s)]
*  Like shutdown of the boost back burn. It did. There goes the hot staging here. Look at that. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=716.48s)]
*  They're gonna be testing this booster like crazy so we might see some fireworks as it comes down [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=722.0s)]
*  and hits the atmosphere. We don't know what to expect. It's like, ugh! SpaceX hasn't really done [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=728.0s)]
*  anything like this with a booster since they started catching them or maybe even at all. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=732.32s)]
*  So all eyes are on booster 14-2 right now slowly heading toward its noble demise but [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=736.64s)]
*  hopefully providing some awesome data in the process. I'm really interested to see the engine [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=743.76s)]
*  out test. And we also keep an eye on the ship. Don't worry. You're worried. We have everything [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=748.48s)]
*  here monitored and again the ship issues the last time happened after the booster both did [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=754.32s)]
*  their touchdown. So basically the moment this booster is out of frame is when we put every [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=761.36s)]
*  attention we have on that shit. Right. What was the timing of the anomalies on seven and eight? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=766.48s)]
*  Was it like seven or eight minutes into flight or am I brain just broken? It's like right after [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=771.76s)]
*  touchdown. It's like eight minutes-ish. Every time people start celebrating on the stream, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=777.44s)]
*  Alex and I went like, uh, but. Yeah. Ooh, hot staging ring. Check that out. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's so cool. You can distinctly see it separate from the booster. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=787.36s)]
*  So curvil. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=793.36s)]
*  I mean booster looks fine so far, right? So far. Yeah, I mean, but it's not in the atmospheric [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  really where it will do some crazy atmospheric things. Right. Also, please ship 35 do good. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=804.24s)]
*  Please ship 35. Come on, 35. Come on, 35. Come on. Here comes the booster. Okay. You can see the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=811.36s)]
*  back end. Those are events. Those are purge events, right? Yeah. See from the bottom of the [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  booster. The fact that this booster is still in frame, by the way, is is remarkable. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=825.84s)]
*  And we are going to hear audio of that engine. We always do, even though it's out over the golf. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  Remember, no catch. They're going potentially simulated catch, but look at the angle of it's [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=838.08s)]
*  totally different. Should be coming up on that. There we go. Look at that. Amazing. That thing is [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=844.1600000000001s)]
*  really coming in fast. Oh, the bottom section just heating up from Aero forces. There's some [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=851.44s)]
*  a blade of cork underneath. Isn't it supposed to start as a booster being replaced by hitting [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=859.36s)]
*  the boosters at some point to stop its descent. Looks like the booster is descending into the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=864.96s)]
*  Hayes. Is there a FTS has been saved. So no FTS active on this booster anymore. That's normal. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=872.24s)]
*  That's good. That's so it's as late as possible. It's out over the golf [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=878.64s)]
*  and it's coming up on that linen burn for the booster. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=883.84s)]
*  Oh, oh, come on. Oh, that looked like a rat. Yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=889.92s)]
*  Oh, we said very much. Yeah. Yeah. And back to the ship. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  Now that's the big ticket. We knew that could happen with the booster. Don't don't [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=903.44s)]
*  don't panic about this. Don't don't. This was expected. This is the big ticket item. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=907.36s)]
*  Six six engines. How are we looking so far? I see six. Yeah, the booster is not was planned [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=913.12s)]
*  out to be reusable, but it failed inside of the engine bay that are. Yeah, but they could be part [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=920.16s)]
*  of new purge system that is placed in the attic to also like protect the section there. So so far, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=926.8s)]
*  I would say finally the speed. Yeah. Thank you. Now I want to preface one thing. Okay. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=935.5200000000001s)]
*  If you see the vacuum Raptors shutting down while the satyrs are still on, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  I think it's crazy that I can get real time footage from a goddamn spaceship out in goddamn [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=947.7600000000001s)]
*  space. Okay. And we have that level of internet, but my stream F's with regular frequency in the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=955.5200000000001s)]
*  heart of Los Angeles. It does not make sense. I'm sorry. How are we getting real time footage [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=964.32s)]
*  from the ass cheeks of a goddamn spaceship all the way up there, but I can't get uninterrupted [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=973.2s)]
*  broadband in the middle of West Hollywood. God, I thought I hate it. I hate it so much. No, I don't [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=980.6400000000001s)]
*  need Starlink because I'm sure that Starlink would not give you uninterrupted access here. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=988.32s)]
*  Starlink is cooked when it's actually cloudy. What are you supposed to do? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=993.2s)]
*  Hezbollah has better internet than me. Yes. Oh no. See that. Okay. Terminal guidance. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=997.44s)]
*  She's in terminal guidance. It's adjusting. It's fine. A few seconds of the burning. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1004.72s)]
*  I saw that too at the very top. Yep. A bit of flame. Come on ship. I'll pull through. You're [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1009.2s)]
*  so close buddy. You're so close. 35. Come on buddy. This dress is killing me. Should be close to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1015.76s)]
*  your back. Shut down. Given the previous ships. There we go. Outrack shutdown. Outrack shutdown. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1021.28s)]
*  Okay. 1000 kilometers per hour away from Seiko. You can do it. Come on buddy. Now purge the stew [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1028.08s)]
*  out of it. Come on buddy. Just be chill. Just be chill. You have it. Come on. I think they got it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1037.6s)]
*  Yes. Let's go. They did it. I'm seeing additional hot spots but who cares. They got to Seiko. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1044.16s)]
*  Yes. Give me a second. I need to release something. That's amazing. That's absolutely amazing. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1054.64s)]
*  He said I need to release something here. He means his nut. He needs to release his nut. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1063.3600000000001s)]
*  It looks like there's some interaction between some of the ice that's being shed. It's like [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1067.68s)]
*  it's stuck back into the... There are vents at the bottom of the aft. Is it tumbling or do you [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1071.68s)]
*  think it's reorienting? He's releasing his nut. There's a lot of venting going on. There's only [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1077.1200000000001s)]
*  one way to find out. Yeah. Real. Yeah. What a beautiful machine. I'm so glad they got through [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1081.3600000000001s)]
*  Seiko. I'm sure they got tons of really valuable data. I really want to know what some of those [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1088.72s)]
*  things we saw were. What's that red stripe on the side? Is that fine? That's fine, right? That's [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1095.1200000000001s)]
*  probably just gap fill for the GPS or something. Yeah. Yes. I'm going to say it's fine. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1100.96s)]
*  Yeah. One of the things to take into account when these ships fly, they are not carrying 100 tons [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1108.0s)]
*  of propellant. They have still leftover... Excuse me. Not 100 tons of propellant. 100 tons of cargo. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1115.3600000000001s)]
*  They still have leftover propellant and what they're doing right now is dumping that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1120.88s)]
*  That's a similar thing that we've seen in previous flights and those vents at the bottom, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1125.76s)]
*  for example, that we saw venting, those are normal. They are in fact there. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1130.4s)]
*  I just saw achieved a carried through across all of our sites. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1133.44s)]
*  Is this paid enthusiasm? Have you ever not... No, this is not paid enthusiasm. This is the most [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1136.96s)]
*  genuine, authentic, autistic enthusiasm you will ever encounter, dude. Are you kidding me? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1146.4s)]
*  So far for Starship's ninth test flight, we lifted off a little bit after 6.30 PM after a couple of [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1153.8400000000001s)]
*  holds that were triggered at the T minus four second mark, but we were able to clear those [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1159.28s)]
*  one on the Raptor, one on the tower, and we were able to lift off successfully from Starbase. 33 [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1163.76s)]
*  out of 30 Raptors... Nerds in the chat acting like they don't act just like this. I know. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1169.68s)]
*  Like when you finally secure the holy grail of the 40K figurine that you were looking for [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1175.6s)]
*  this whole time. So coming up at about T plus 18 minutes, 26 seconds, we'll have the first [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1181.12s)]
*  deployment of simulated Starlink satellites planned from Starship. That will be followed [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1186.8s)]
*  at about T plus 37 minutes and 49 seconds by the relight of a single Raptor sea level engine in [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1191.9199999999998s)]
*  space. This is going to help us gather data on our ability to do a deorbit burn for future Starship [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1197.9199999999998s)]
*  missions that will go orbital. And then of course, one of the... Sex hammer. Thank you for the 10 [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1203.28s)]
*  give to subs. ... modifications to Starship. And that'll start with re-entry into Earth's atmosphere [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1208.08s)]
*  at about the T plus 45 minute mark, which should take about 16, 18 minutes to complete. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1213.92s)]
*  And now today's re-entry is going to test that heat shield like we said, specifically how Starship [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1220.24s)]
*  will hold up to 100 missing heat shield tiles on its thermal protection system. Now we purposely [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1225.8400000000001s)]
*  took the... Please stop engaging in... You are... Please stop. You're engaging in anti-stem axion. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1232.4s)]
*  Yes, them lords are vital to our society, but subjecting normies to listen to them nerd out [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1237.2s)]
*  is creating so much anti-stem hate in your community, including me. Yeah, no, that's why [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1242.0s)]
*  I've been doing it. That's why I've been doing it. I want people to feel the way that I do about [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1246.16s)]
*  space autists. As you might know, I am related to one. Actually, NASA engineer here, absolutely [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1253.12s)]
*  fucking hate Elon Musk and don't think his plans for Mars are realistic. Thoughts all of my own, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1259.52s)]
*  but this is definitely cool technology and his progress towards some cool science we conduct [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1264.24s)]
*  to better understand people and our planets. Yeah, I don't do anti-Semitism, but I do engage [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1267.6s)]
*  in anti-stem-itism. Yes, I am anti-stem, stem medic. No quarters for stem lords. I'm also a [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1273.1999999999998s)]
*  NASA engineer. I sabotaged a rocket. It's going to blow in two minutes. Yeah. You're in what the [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  fuck? Wait, maybe that chatter was right. What the hell? Great update from Chris. This view. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1287.36s)]
*  I was just about to make fun of the F T I was about to make fun of that chatter. And then, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1292.08s)]
*  you know, the footage freaked out for a second. Big fan of you, but that anti-stem-itism joke is [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1296.72s)]
*  ass classic classic stem Lord immediately. It's like I'm in the cross-airs. I don't like it. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1304.08s)]
*  Bro felt attacked. Yeah. All right. Let's get back to it. Europe changes the rules on long-range [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1310.24s)]
*  missiles that from now on, Ukraine can use the weapons that have been donated to it. The missiles [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1315.28s)]
*  by the West at unlimited ranges. And that's quite a big point until now. Ukraine has been fairly [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1320.72s)]
*  limited in the ranges it can use these weapons at. But now that restriction has taken off. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1327.76s)]
*  And there are three main types of weapons that we're most interested in this respect. One is [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1332.0s)]
*  storm shadow. The British weapon is also a French version called scalp. It's exactly the same weapon. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1336.32s)]
*  That's air launch and very capable. Another one is the Atkins, which is the American weapon launched [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1341.76s)]
*  from the ground to ground-based weapon ground to ground. And the third one, the one that we're most [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1347.28s)]
*  interested in Hassan on me. Thank you for the 50 gift is subs. I will be purchasing attack homes [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1351.6s)]
*  with the, with the money. Your financial contributions not only help me maintain editorial [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1358.24s)]
*  independence, but also allow me to purchase attack homes, which is perhaps the most American [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1363.68s)]
*  name you can give an American missile system. Attack homes really is the tourist missile. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1372.08s)]
*  Now, Ukraine probably doesn't have any of these yet, but it may be getting them very soon. Not [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1379.52s)]
*  confirmed, but distance limits have been lifted time for Ukraine to strike the white house to [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1383.36s)]
*  get the U S serious about getting a peace deal. I don't think any of those have that range, but, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1387.2s)]
*  but that looks like the probability and the tourist missile has a better range [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1393.12s)]
*  and a much more sophisticated war. I'm giving, I'm giving the Houthis attack homes with your [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1397.1999999999998s)]
*  financial contributions than storm shadow or scalp. And the reason that these weapons are so [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1401.6799999999998s)]
*  important in the next phase of this war is the range that they can cover inside Russia. If we [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1408.3999999999999s)]
*  look at a map of the ranges that these weapons may cover, think in terms of a firing point, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1414.9599999999998s)]
*  somewhere around the Northern frontier of Ukraine, somewhere around Sue me, that's just a guess on our [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1420.9599999999998s)]
*  part, but you can see there how much of Western Russia might be covered by these weapons. And [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1426.16s)]
*  there's something else here. Whereas Atacom's has got a fixed range, it's ground to ground, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1431.44s)]
*  Taurus and storm shadow are launched from aircraft. So their range is extended by wherever [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1436.24s)]
*  the aircraft goes. If a Ukrainian aircraft went into Russian airspace and released any of those [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1441.6000000000001s)]
*  weapons, then they go even further. And that's why these weapons would have a big effect potentially [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1446.64s)]
*  on the next phase of the war, because the Ukrainians could target the fixed areas of [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1453.04s)]
*  Russian reinforcements, the logistics hubs, the underground bunkers, the airfields, and even the [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1459.6s)]
*  concentrations of armor and troops, as we believe the Russians are preparing for a new offensive [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1464.0s)]
*  in the north of the country and in the southeast of the country. And that's why the Russians are so [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1469.2s)]
*  angry about this statement. They're making all sorts of frightening statements as they always do. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1474.3999999999999s)]
*  They normally talk about the danger of nuclear escalate. I love missile time on QVC. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1479.6799999999998s)]
*  Get ready. There's more of them. There will be more of them. I'm surprised that they don't say [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1485.52s)]
*  that in the next 24 or 48 hours. Don't take it too seriously. But that's where we are for now. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1489.4399999999998s)]
*  Ukraine needs Western targeting data and operators to do long range strikes. Deep strikes in the [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1494.48s)]
*  Russia will be directly done by what Ukraine cannot target anything. They have literally zero sets. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1499.04s)]
*  Yeah. Also, this will this will create in this same retaliation towards Ukraine as well. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1503.84s)]
*  But then again, I don't know what the fuck you do about it. You know what I mean? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1512.6399999999999s)]
*  Like insane retaliation, because there were suspicions that I don't know how true this is, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1516.8799999999999s)]
*  but there were suspicions that Ukrainian drones almost targeted. Like there was there was some [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1524.1599999999999s)]
*  rumors swirling about the Ukrainian drones almost targeted Vladimir Putin's helicopter on its way [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1531.6s)]
*  back from Kursk. And then that was why they bombed the fuck out of Kiev. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1537.52s)]

*  things would have already happened to Russia. And I mean... Dude, what is this? Dude, he's a child. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1553.6799999999998s)]
*  This is a child. A child is running the country, the most powerful country on the planet. Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1559.6000000000001s)]

*  He's going to release the brave soldier, Ryan Ruth, and his 1000 NATO trained Afghan soldiers and [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1572.16s)]

*  fire. That fire might come in the form of new sanctions, according to sources talking to CNN. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1583.92s)]

*  that would have... Starship failed? I cannot believe you guys did. You mad lads. Just another [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1605.04s)]
*  way you can support what we do. Also, I'm sure the team out in the field is working on metal print. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1613.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay. Okay. I have something to tell you here. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. He said it was [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1622.24s)]
*  very critical because in case they lose a heat shield tile at a critical point on the ship, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1631.92s)]
*  that tells me this is a test of their... Fighting day so far. There's more terror in the next few [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1637.52s)]
*  minutes. What a great update from Chris. This view, is that from the FTS box? Wait, that one [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1643.12s)]
*  chatter was not wrong. He actually works at NASA and he sabotaged the operation. What the fuck? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1651.92s)]
*  The timeline matches up. What the fuck? Dude. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1658.72s)]
*  Dude. What the fuck? Yeah. Space Force is about to come knocking down your door, chatter. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1662.24s)]
*  What the hell happened? Light termination system box. It might be. It looked like it was looking [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1676.16s)]
*  up, right? Look at those colors. Is that plasma? No, that's sunset. Sunset. It's going into sunset [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1682.72s)]
*  now. I know I keep saying this. What a gorgeous machine. Yeah. Wait, did it actually fuck up or [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1694.16s)]
*  no? I'm so glad it made it. It made it. These guys are still nutting. So do we think it's going to [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1704.72s)]
*  make it through entry? I said it again. 100 missing tiles? Well, it's now on a path at least [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1710.96s)]
*  to get to the entry interface. Another whole thing is whether it survives afterward. Right. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1722.24s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know. He said it was very critical because in case they lose a heat shield tile at [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1728.08s)]
*  a critical point on the ship, that tells me this is a test of their, they want to see if it can make [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1737.28s)]
*  it or not. 50 at that point. You got to figure if you have a crewed vehicle, like a Starship coming [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1743.12s)]
*  back in. Hey, look at that. I wanted this. I wanted this for the deployment. Please. Please show us the [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1751.52s)]
*  door open and the payload deploy. Oh my God. Okay. Door off to left, door off to right. You can't nut [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1758.96s)]
*  hard, dude. It is fucked up. I don't know. I'm actually not. No, I don't know. I can't tell. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1767.04s)]
*  I think door below us because look at the rails, the feeding rails. I think it was to the right [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1774.56s)]
*  or to the left. I'm not sure. Either way, have some respect, sir. If you had a crude vehicle, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1778.96s)]
*  what happened to decency, sir? And you're missing tiles and you know, you're missing tiles. You [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1783.52s)]
*  probably want to know exactly how many you can miss while still being safe. And you probably [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1787.84s)]
*  want to know exactly where you can miss them. Like what if you miss one on this weld line? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1792.0s)]
*  What if you miss one on this? So about 14 minutes from now. Cool. Hey, there's the top of the [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1797.12s)]
*  Margueriteville. Hello. Agent D. Hey guys, you look fantastic. Great tracking. So did it fail or not? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1802.88s)]
*  They look, they look all very like they are just roasted by the sun. Getting plenty of sunshine. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1811.6s)]
*  That they're talking amongst themselves. Oh, payload did not deploy them, but they, we can't know [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1822.96s)]
*  can do more work. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1831.92s)]
*  The door was stuck in their fake payload did not deploy for all the hard work. You guys are also, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1836.0s)]
*  you guys are hopefully checking here. I guess technically it's a, it's a failure show the rack [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1840.72s)]
*  now and all of the equipment that they have to haul up to the roof. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1846.0s)]
*  It's just actually quite hard to do. It is. I've done it many times. It's now we're getting into [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1852.24s)]
*  the summertime, which really like if you've ever been on the roof of anything in the summer, let [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1857.6s)]
*  alone a hotel in on the beach, then you know, being on the roof is no joke. Oh, we got a thumbs up at [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1861.76s)]
*  the end too. Awesome. Ship 35 minutes coast phase. We're waiting on an official report of what [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1870.08s)]
*  happened to boost 14-2. I saw a relight, but it blew up when it really, really, yeah, I think, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1877.9199999999998s)]
*  I think it had too much. So we just, so again, it was an experiment and we are all like, no, but [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1885.52s)]
*  nobody here thinks bumped right now. Right? Like, yeah, this was, this was potentially going to [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1892.56s)]
*  happen. This, this is what they wanted to test. They wanted to test the limit and spoiler, they [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1898.72s)]
*  found one. So yeah. Beach people. They're okay. Yeah. And they saw it. Apparently a shot of South [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1902.96s)]
*  Padre Island and that's what the beach looks like. And yeah, those people went to see a launch. They [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1918.32s)]
*  saw a launch. They saw a successful stage separation and they saw the booster return [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1922.72s)]
*  to a point. And it seems to me that the booster, what happened is that when it said relight, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1928.56s)]
*  it said, okay, I'll light this up. It lit more than the 13 engines. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1933.6000000000001s)]
*  Let's as the ship is coasting, right? It's in its coast phase. Let's go to Ryan Caton [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1944.88s)]
*  for a trajectory update, Ryan. Well, here we go. Not exactly the trajectory, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1948.96s)]
*  but we do have the timeline minutes, 56 seconds. That is when second engine cutoff took place. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1956.64s)]
*  That was a very nice thing to see, but let's move the timeline forward and let's move towards, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1962.64s)]
*  well, then you fall in over here. Let's move towards something that isn't happening. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1966.96s)]
*  The starting demo deployment. I'm going to move that cabinet out of the way for the next flight. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1970.32s)]
*  You can be rest assured of that. But something we do have coming up is the Raptor in space [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1975.36s)]
*  relight. Bro, it's like a whole different person from this angle into flight here. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1979.6799999999998s)]
*  That's actually scheduled for 21 seconds later than it was for the blast flight. Of course, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1983.52s)]
*  the last flight didn't actually get to that point, but an interesting note with the timeline. So [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1988.3999999999999s)]
*  that's coming up at 40 minutes into flight approximately. And then as we move on, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1992.24s)]
*  we are of course going to get to the reentry of the Starship. Entry interface should be occurring [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=1996.8s)]
*  approximately 30 seconds later than they thought it would be doing on the previous flight. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2001.6s)]
*  However, I love these guys, man. Okay. I take it back. That's when Starship is transonic. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2005.9199999999998s)]
*  That's only six seconds. Stemlords are the best, dude. Look at how excited they are. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2010.7199999999998s)]
*  Ship side of things. That's just passing over an hour and three minutes there into [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2015.28s)]
*  that. Y'all are making fun of the reflection in the mirror at this point. Okay. Sub sonic again, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2020.24s)]
*  six minutes later than the previous flight. And if we pause it here again, only five seconds later [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2025.9199999999998s)]
*  for the landing flip. This is one hour, six minutes and 11 seconds into flight here for the [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2031.04s)]
*  ship. And then of course we will get fingers crossed if we make it through reentry, a exciting [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2036.0s)]
*  landing that burns starting 10 seconds earlier than was planned on the previous flight and then [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2042.0s)]
*  splashdown occurring 12 seconds later than was planned on the previous flight. One hour, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2047.6s)]
*  six minutes and 38 seconds after leaving Starbase. Fingers crossed the ship should make it to the [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2052.16s)]
*  Indian Ocean. And one more thing just to check out very quickly, where actually will the ship be [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2058.24s)]
*  landing? Let's take a look at the reentry zone here. Leaving Australia, this is the Indian Ocean. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2062.56s)]
*  We of course have our airspace closures for Madagascar, Mauritius and Australian airspace. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2067.7599999999998s)]
*  The ship will be coming from Africa over clipping the south of Madagascar and then slowly coasting. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2072.56s)]
*  We'll start reentry around this area here. This is where we'll start to see plasma generating [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2078.08s)]
*  on the belly of Starship. It will then reenter the atmosphere and hopefully if it's in the same [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2083.44s)]
*  location as the previous flight, we will see a soft splashdown or at least a splashdown [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2088.16s)]
*  around this area here in Australian airspace. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2093.76s)]
*  Thank you, Ryan, for that. We have a breaking news update. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2102.32s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not, I'm not saying the big alarm yet. I'm like, I have like multiple alarms. I'm [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2105.52s)]
*  pushing the medium-sized alarm. The ship is definitely giving me a bit of like 28 [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2114.6400000000003s)]
*  vibes. It's quite spinny on overall and that's not what I like to supersede. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2121.04s)]
*  Look at the bottom right. We're talking about the attitude indicator there. There you go. Thank you, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2129.52s)]
*  Kevin. That attitude indicator, I mean maybe it's just doing a barbecue roll. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2134.0s)]
*  It's just doing like a thermal management. Oh, can we go full screen? There we go. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2140.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's ship 28 vibes. It's sort of actually more like ship 34 but without the engines. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2146.72s)]
*  It's going to be an interesting reentry. Let's say that. It doesn't look like they're able to get [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2157.68s)]
*  stable video off of it. Perhaps because of, of attitude control issues, clearly speculating here. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2161.76s)]
*  I'm speculating just based on the graphic, but you see how it's intermittent like that. And then [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2167.92s)]
*  the ship will roll to a point where the dish can no longer. You're making fun of these guys. When [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2174.32s)]
*  this is you. Oh my God. Riz Riz. I'm a baby. I'm a little baby. I'm a little, who would have thought [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2179.1200000000003s)]
*  that block two will repeat the same three first flight. I don't know what that has to do with [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2185.6000000000004s)]
*  anything. I have a question. We saw clean engine shutdown sequence. At least it looked like. Oh [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2190.32s)]
*  shit. It might reenter and break up overland. And that's really bad. Cause this. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2197.76s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out what forces on this vehicle would do this event could have frozen [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2204.88s)]
*  and stuck open. Yeah, that's possible. Did that has that happened on a previous flight? That sounds [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2210.6400000000003s)]
*  vaguely familiar to me. It could be something completely different. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2216.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, maybe there's also like, I'm playing the optimus here. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2224.64s)]
*  Or in a little bit of a spin. We did spring a leak in some of the fuel tank systems inside of starship, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2229.2799999999997s)]
*  which a lot of those are used for your attitude control. And so at this point we've essentially [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2236.48s)]
*  lost our attitude control with starship. We are still on a path toward reentry. We are suborbital. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2243.7599999999998s)]
*  So no matter what we are going to enter, however, this lowers the chance for it to be a controlled [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2250.3999999999996s)]
*  reentry. So if you think back to flight three, when we had, they're using nerd language to say [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2257.6s)]
*  it's flipping out of control of the loss of attitude control, we were in a role by the time [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2264.08s)]
*  we hit reentry. So we are going to reenter. We should hopefully still have used the starlink [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2269.2s)]
*  satellites are pretty robust to still maintaining contact. We've got four of those terminals on the [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2276.08s)]
*  vehicle and they're pretty robust to maintaining contact. Even when we are drilling chatters, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2281.3599999999997s)]
*  get your cameras pointed up. So we should hopefully continue to keep live use. It's going to still be [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2286.08s)]
*  dark until we get a little bit closer to entry as we are a little bit, we're coming up on [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2291.4399999999996s)]
*  Africa. I believe we do swing just to the south of that continent. And by the time we start heading [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2298.8s)]
*  out, we'll start heading into a sunrise. So the Middle East, not looking great with a lot of our [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2305.2000000000003s)]
*  on orbit objectives for today, where we were hoping to do the PES deploy and relight an engine and then [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2311.92s)]
*  really importantly get into that controlled entry to really put the heat shield through the ringer. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2317.52s)]
*  Uh, nonetheless, Starship marching forward towards that reentry over the Indian ocean. So we'll [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2323.2799999999997s)]
*  continue to hang with it and the Huthi should course correct by sending one of their like [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2329.3599999999997s)]
*  space missiles in the direction of this one. So we got through Seco, you know what I mean? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2335.12s)]
*  And hit it up top. We made it through second engine cutoff and you know, like Jack said earlier, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2342.24s)]
*  if it was easy, everybody would do it. Oh, God, the patch release jinxed it. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2349.76s)]
*  There's a patch. It didn't. It didn't. It didn't. Don't say that. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2355.1200000000003s)]
*  No, to your point, Gene, we all, I think if you go back and watch the coverage from today in the [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2366.0800000000004s)]
*  lead up to this mission, I think we've hammered home over and over again that the main goal is [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2372.5600000000004s)]
*  getting through Seco. Uh, the most important data is getting through Seco. Second most, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2377.36s)]
*  I think arguably is the reentry data, which they're not going to get, which is not great [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2383.52s)]
*  to be sure. We're going to get some, but it's what, what did we say on this very stream? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2387.92s)]
*  Right. When we got to, uh, to Seco, we said, you know, they did it. Yay. They got it. Progress [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2393.1200000000003s)]
*  is, I believe the exact word that Alex used. Progress has been made. We can be plenty forgiving [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2399.6s)]
*  isn't that cope [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2406.4s)]
*  like, didn't it not only fail to open the door for deploying its fake payload, but it also is [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2412.1600000000003s)]
*  like failing on reentry. So it failed on both of the, it failed on both accounts, right? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2420.48s)]
*  Tell this to the investors. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0DwPzp4dW4&t=2431.92s)]
