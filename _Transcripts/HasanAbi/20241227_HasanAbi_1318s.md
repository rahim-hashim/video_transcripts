# Cybertruck Is So Sick | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A)
*  It also has gone through numerous safety standards. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=0.0s)]
*  The Cybertruck, the Tesla truck, not capable of doing truck like things. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=3.08s)]
*  And I don't even understand how they are. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=8.84s)]
*  I don't even know how they're allowed to be operational on the road. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=12.34s)]
*  All the while, we can't even have Chinese EVs in this marketplace. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=16.34s)]
*  What is this? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=26.22s)]
*  People keep correcting me, telling me that it's Cybertruck and not Tesla truck. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=28.02s)]
*  I don't f**king care! I don't care what it's called! [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=33.62s)]
*  I hate them! I hate them! [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=37.7s)]
*  I need them off the streets! I need them off the road! I need them on the highway! [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=39.7s)]
*  I need them out of my town! I need them out of my country! [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=43.3s)]
*  F**k! F**k! [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=45.7s)]
*  I'm so sick of them! I'm so sick of Tesla trucks! [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=47.2s)]
*  Dude, this is so true. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  It's like, it's not only an eyesore and incredibly uggo. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=52.2s)]
*  By the way, Mishma, thank you for the 50 of the subs. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=56.04s)]
*  That's crazy. Casually just dropped a 50 bomb and I didn't even see it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  And nobody even pointed it out. What's happening in this community? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  Money changed us. Okay. Mishma, thank you for the 50 big ones. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=67.48s)]
*  The thing I was going to say about the, the thing I was going to say about the Cybertrucks in general [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=74.0s)]
*  is that not only are they an eyesore, they are literally illegal to drive in Europe. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=78.56s)]
*  As far as I understand, because there is no way that they would pass any safety standards. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=84.76s)]
*  The fact that, the fact that they have these like jagged sharp edges automatically make them a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=89.56s)]
*  hazard to begin with. And also on top of that, it doesn't seem to have like real crumple zones. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=95.56s)]
*  I don't know what's going on there. I don't understand how this car is allowed to be [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=101.72s)]
*  driven on the roads. I don't understand how we have decided in the United States of America [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=105.4s)]
*  to go back to a Ford Pinto style governance. I don't understand how there was so much back and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=111.48s)]
*  forth in terms of cars that you can purchase that would kill you. Okay. Cars that you can purchase. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=117.48s)]
*  I could kill you was a thing of the past. Okay. And we collectively as a society decided that, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  no, you shouldn't be able to buy a car with the full knowledge that it can just like [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  genuinely devastate, genuinely devastate you. Like it has to have, it has to abide by certain [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=137.8s)]
*  safety standards. And I don't know, I don't know why I'm way more concerned about the F-150 being [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=144.2s)]
*  the most sold vehicle for a decade than a few cyber trucks that at least have better visibility. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they're really bad. Their chassis is ass. It breaks regularly. There's no way that it has [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=155.24s)]
*  any sort of towing capacity whatsoever. It's quite literally welded on to, I believe an aluminum [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=161.0s)]
*  chassis. So they constantly are there constantly, if you off-road it a little bit, they break. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=167.16s)]
*  So it's not capable of doing any number of the different things that it's supposed to be doing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=173.8s)]
*  It's basically a bad truck, at least like, at least overall, the F-150 is a durable vehicle, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  buddy. The F-150 has been through validation and testing on like these dumpster fires. Exactly. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Like the F-150 is ginormous and it should have never gotten to that size. Okay. I agree with that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=191.88s)]
*  If you were to tell me, you know, Ford abuse cafe standards and basically created these monstrous [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=198.68s)]
*  trucks and the, like the smallest truck that you can purchase from Ford is basically an F-150. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=204.6s)]
*  Well, there you got the Ranger and the Maverick, but overall, the fact that like the F-150 is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=210.04s)]
*  ginormous in size. Okay. And it's, and it is a terrifying tank like demon on the road. And it [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=216.28s)]
*  is the most sold vehicle in the United States of America is definitely a problem, but at least it [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=226.76s)]
*  does truck things. You might actually purchase it because you're a soccer mom. You might purchase [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=234.76s)]
*  it because you are the manager or you are a contractor, but you don't actually do any of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=240.6s)]
*  the construction work, but you want to have a sick car when you drive over to the lot. Okay. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=246.44s)]
*  Many people do that. Many people buy it just for groceries. Having said that, however, at least [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  if push comes to shove, it can do truck like things. Okay. It can do truck like things. It [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=256.76s)]
*  can tow stuff. It can, if you want to off-road, it's like, it's a thing that you can do. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=264.04s)]
*  There are truck things you can do with this truck. It also has gone through numerous safety standards. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=271.16s)]
*  The cyber truck, the Tesla truck, not capable of doing truck like things. And I don't even understand [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  how they are. I don't even know how they're allowed to be operational on the road all the while. We [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=284.04s)]
*  can't even have Chinese EVs in this damn marketplace. We can't have K trucks. We can't [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=291.16s)]
*  have a better pickups, Japanese trucks that are significantly smaller, but have literally the same [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=296.6s)]
*  size bed, despite making up half the size of the truck in and of itself. So it's very frustrating. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  It's especially frustrating because like, I've been looking at possibly buying a larger vehicle [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=311.56s)]
*  or leasing a larger vehicle rather, because obviously the Taycan in and of itself is too small. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=317.32s)]
*  That's just it. And my lease is about to be up, but it's frustrating because like, I want to get [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=325.48s)]
*  a, I want to get an SUV or I want to get a truck, but they're so large. They're so damn large. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=333.16s)]
*  And it's very frustrating. So I don't know what to do. I really, really, really want a forerunner. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=339.64s)]
*  I want it so bad. The 2025 forerunners unfortunately have been pushed back in production. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=344.2s)]
*  That is my, that is my dream car, highest trim level off road, baby. You know, bust that shit out. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  Forerunners go to my brother-in-law has one with the golden same size of Kaia forerunners also have [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=357.56s)]
*  a third row as well. If you want that, which is crazy. Cause the Land Cruiser doesn't, I don't know [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=361.48s)]
*  what the Toyota was thinking in the 2025 Land Cruisers. They literally have cooked the Land [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=365.4s)]
*  Cruisers in an effort to sell the Lexus version of the Land Cruiser more. They've basically cooked [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=369.24s)]
*  themselves on that front. I don't know why. I don't know why anyone would buy a Land Cruiser [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=374.52000000000004s)]
*  instead of a forerunner in 2025. So rural cosplayer, you know, it's really funny. Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  They do have a hybrid. The forerunner hybrid is what I want to purchase. What's really interesting [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  about that. What's really interesting about that is, is that, yeah, the Lexus GX two at 2025 is [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  pretty sick too, but I don't really like Lexus. I like Toyota's. I want a land runner or a land [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=394.2s)]
*  cruiser. I want to land cruise from like 1978. Okay. That's what I want. That's my dream car, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=400.12s)]
*  like the FJ. What is it like the FJ something? Those cars are fantastic. I know Lexus are [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=405.47999999999996s)]
*  Toyota's. I just get annoyed that it says Lexus on it and not Toyota. Maybe it's because I am a freaking, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=412.68s)]
*  uh, you know, men a dad. Okay. It is my most metadata quality, even though men, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=420.03999999999996s)]
*  it has love Lexus as well. I just think that, uh, the Toyota sticker gives me a pride and joy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=424.52s)]
*  Okay. I would rather have a Toyota sticker on a car than a Lexus sticker, even if it had the Lexus [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=431.56s)]
*  specs, because obviously it's a much better trim. Watch Doug DeMiro video with a forerunner. He [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=435.4s)]
*  didn't buy one. No, he tried out the, um, the, the, they're not available yet. I trust me. I know. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=439.24s)]
*  I've been watching it. Oh, 400. Oh, this is a 400 horsepower coyote V8 equipped with first [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=444.44s)]
*  generation Ford Bronco. Yeah. This is sick. The rest of modded Broncos are incredible. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=450.36s)]
*  I was thinking about potentially getting a rest. Oh, modded Evie Bronco. The problem is like, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=456.28s)]
*  I don't know. Anyway, whatever. I hate doing the, I hate doing Hassanabi and dog, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=460.76s)]
*  Kaya, Piker's stunning new photo and the Porsche Taycan and LA traffic. I mean, this is literally [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=466.12s)]
*  how it is. When I have Kaya in the car, I do want to get a, I want to get a larger car specifically [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=469.8s)]
*  because like one for Kaya and two, I want to get a larger car because like when I go [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  do stuff, you know, when I go out into the world, when I go to like stream or whatever, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=481.8s)]
*  I want to be able to pack five people into the car. And the Taycan is just virtually impossible [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=487.8s)]
*  to pack five people into the car with or at least four people in Kaya. And Kaya is basically the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=493.24s)]
*  size of a person. So how about an international scout? It's not even out yet. You guys are [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=499.64s)]
*  literally talking about cars that are not out yet. The scouts are sick, but anyway, we'll see [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=504.59999999999997s)]
*  Rivian SUV support your boss. So you want to limit people's rights to bear arms, but you still want [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  to bear arms and no regulations as can be proven by Kaya. Yes. Get an escalate. No, an escalate V [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=515.56s)]
*  would hit. I have seen the escalate EVs. They're kind of sick. I don't even understand how you [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=522.6s)]
*  can have a literal tank be an EV. It has to be like 50 miles. I don't get it. Why do you lease [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=528.44s)]
*  instead of buy the reason why I lease cars instead of buying them is because well, one is a [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  depreciating asset, not to get all econ one on one on your ass. But the real reason is because [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=540.6800000000001s)]
*  electric vehicles have outdated technology and fall out of fashion fairly quickly. So like, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=545.8800000000001s)]
*  because it's in its infancy stage and megaphonics and fango lives, we'll get up my ass for saying [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  this, but it's 100% true. Like new battery technology renders old battery technology [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=558.44s)]
*  virtually useless. So there is, I don't see any reason to purchase an electric vehicle. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=563.8000000000001s)]
*  Like the Taycan that I got was what? Like 120 K the Taycan forest. I leased it. The value of the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=570.2s)]
*  2022 Taycan forest right now is like 40 grand. Okay. It's just like the cyber trucks are going [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=576.76s)]
*  50 K below sticker price at this moment. People bought the first edition, get an electric G wagon, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=585.56s)]
*  loads of headroom. Yeah, I know. I kind of want an electric G wagon, but it's the same exact issues [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=590.92s)]
*  with the electric G wagon. When you buy an EV first edition vehicle, you're paying a 10 K 20 K [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=595.88s)]
*  over the sticker price for no reason. You're paying 10 K 20 K over the sticker price. It's [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=602.68s)]

*  So that's what the problem is. 1980s toy to pick up with an EV swab would be SIG with a John Brown [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=615.4s)]
*  hunting club drip. I mean, yeah, that is something that I, the problem with the EV swaps, I'll just [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  say this, this is the last thing I'm going to say before moving on to the news. Okay. The problem [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=627.0799999999999s)]
*  with an EV swap in general is that if you get a rest, oh, modded car like that, which is something [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=632.2s)]
*  that I really desire, something that I love, I've wanted the Ford F 100 illuminator. As you guys know, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=637.6400000000001s)]
*  it's amazing. It's a concept car at this point. You can only purchase the battery if you want to. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=643.08s)]
*  And the battery, I think itself is like 400 grand or some crazy shit. It's not a real thing, but the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=647.48s)]
*  problem with resto mods in general is that they're janky, they're finicky, they will break. And I am [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=653.88s)]
*  not a car guy trucks in and of itself are already janky and finicky. And they do sometimes break [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=659.24s)]
*  resto mods. Ultimately are a problem. You can't have a resto mod. That's anything but a Sunday [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=665.5600000000001s)]

*  Oh, the Grenadiers are sick too. I know. Do you guys know what the Grenadiers are? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=681.72s)]
*  Hold on. I'll show you the Grenadier. Does Doug DiMiro have a Grenadier video? He probably does. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=685.96s)]
*  He has a video for everything. And it's also for all the specs. This is just like one rich guy. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=690.52s)]
*  This is a rich guy, some rich fucking like chemical petroleum billionaire that literally was like, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=698.36s)]
*  I'm going to make basically like a OG Land Cruiser slash real, you know, look at this. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=703.48s)]
*  Today's video is brought to you by cars and bids my online company, Ineos. Now the founder of Ineos [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=711.08s)]
*  is Jim Ratcliffe. He's a British billionaire who has nostalgia for the original old school [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=719.32s)]
*  Land Rover Defender. And I guess he thinks the new I think the land road, the old school Land [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=726.44s)]
*  Rover Defender is fucking mint. How is that street legal? It looks like a child death machine. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=731.08s)]
*  These are literally smaller than escalates, dude. What are you talking about? The American perception [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=736.2s)]
*  of vehicles are so goddamn warped. Like when you look at, when you, when you look at like any [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=741.96s)]
*  fucking, any like midsize SUV in the United States of America, you, you literally, you literally go, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=747.72s)]
*  this would be the largest car anyone has ever seen in, in on the road. Meanwhile for America, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=755.8s)]
*  it's like small Defender is a little too soft, too gross, disgusting. Look at what they've done [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=762.44s)]
*  to our boy luxury to high tech. So he set about creating a brand new car that had the ethos of [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=769.24s)]
*  the original Defender. And that is the Grenadier. Now, despite the look of the Grenadier, this doesn't [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=778.36s)]
*  share any components with the old school Land Rover Defender. It just has a similar look and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=786.2s)]
*  similar purpose to be an off-road focused basic SUV without all the luxury bits that so many [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=791.7199999999999s)]
*  modern ones have as. Yon new topic, please. How much more of ape men are we going to be [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=799.4799999999999s)]
*  debating cars? Grow up everyone. It's just a subjective choice from getting point A to point B. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=804.1199999999999s)]
*  Brilliant. Brilliant. Take chatter for the name, the Grenadier. Apparently it is named after the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=807.9599999999999s)]
*  pub in London, where the idea of it was conceived the Grenadier pub and hence the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=814.52s)]
*  Ineos Grenadier, a very British story and a few other basics here in the United. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=821.56s)]
*  And anyway, I'm woke of the day. I know classic. You have to buy Toyota Japan loss, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=827.48s)]
*  almost one mill people this year soon. They will be extinct. This song, get it while you can listen. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=833.8s)]
*  You know, my dream car is a fucking 1997 Toyota crown. Okay. I want a 1997 Toyota crown and I [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  want to Hilux. Those are the cars I want. Also no Toyota's not going extinct. Japan might go [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=845.1600000000001s)]
*  extinct, but Toyota will not. When you were in London, did you go to the water rats pub [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=851.4000000000001s)]
*  where Mark's frequented and lived above for a while? No, I did not. Yeah. Toyota crowns in [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=855.8000000000001s)]
*  the West are very different than the Toyota crowns. A crown. Did y'all have that in Turkey? No, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=860.12s)]
*  we have Corolla's. I grew up with Corolla's anyway, seven time at formula one champion. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=864.6s)]
*  Lewis Hamilton sold his Pagani Zonda and is on his classic arc. I support your old school era. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=870.12s)]
*  I think I have a sneaking suspicion that if electric right now, all right, I'm going to make [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=875.96s)]
*  a take it's Hassan Abiy tag time. Are you ready for this? Hassan Abiy take time. Hold on. Let me, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=881.5600000000001s)]
*  let me get it started too. Okay. Hold on. Electric vehicles are on a downtrend. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=887.48s)]
*  While the Chinese EV market is basically capturing the rest of the globe and sucking [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=893.88s)]
*  up the entire car market in general. Here in the United States of America, it seems that people [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=900.92s)]
*  are no longer as invested in electric vehicles. It's now being seen as a former fascination. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=908.6s)]
*  Battery technology is obviously one of the major issues and these cars depreciate quite dramatically. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=915.96s)]
*  Having said that, however, there is one thing that could absolutely dominate the EV market. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=921.56s)]
*  If you wanted to bring EVs back in a big way, what you must do is move away from the futuristic [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=929.16s)]
*  looking duckbill style pill shaped vehicles. What you must do is create electric vehicles [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=937.8s)]
*  that look retro. Retrofuturism is the way. Give me some fucking El Caminos. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=947.4s)]
*  Give me some old school Lincolns. God damn it. Give me a wooden station wagon with an EV. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  Give me a 1970s looking boxy Bronco with an EV kit in it. Give me a Ford 100 illuminator with an EV. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=965.3199999999999s)]
*  Give it to me. Make this shit analog. No more massive fucking iPad screens everywhere. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=976.04s)]
*  You need to have tactile functional buttons in the cars. That is why I love Toyota still. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=983.16s)]
*  Give me old vehicles that are retro from the 80s and the 90s that have an EV battery package in it [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=991.7199999999999s)]
*  and you will bring back EVs in a major way. Also, last but not least, make sure [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=999.96s)]
*  that these cars also have sound. If one wishes to actually make others hear the sound of an engine, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1007.4s)]
*  you can simulate whatever sound you want. That's right. Give me a goddamn EV that looks old [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1016.28s)]
*  That's right. Give me a goddamn EV that looks old and also has speakers outside so people can [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1023.08s)]
*  hear the fucking engine and it's not any of that fucking random alien space and I will purchase it. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1030.04s)]
*  None of that shit. Okay. I want to hear a fucking real engine purr. Now, it's really interesting [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1037.8s)]
*  because there is a car company that is doing what I've demanded basically. It's Dodge. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1044.68s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, I believe Dodge is bringing back its challengers and it will the, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1050.76s)]
*  or maybe it's Chargers. Sorry. Dodge is going to the 2024 Dodge Charger is going to be an electric [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1057.8s)]
*  vehicle. Okay. And not only is going to, is it going to be an electric vehicle, but it also will [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1064.68s)]
*  have speakers so you can actually hear. So you can actually hear the engine, like a simulated engine [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1070.44s)]
*  sound. The problem is it's still very much pill shaped and I hate that. I fucking hate that. I [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1078.28s)]
*  hate like, look at how pill shaped all these goddamn cars are. That is the only benefit [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1084.84s)]
*  that the, with the exception of the scout, even though the scout is also kind of pill shaped as [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1090.52s)]
*  well, the scouts look kind of cool, but they all want to make their cars look so like, I don't know, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1094.28s)]
*  they want to, everybody wants to make their cars look cool. They want to make their cars look [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1100.52s)]
*  futuristic. And I don't care about that. The I-5M looks kind of sick though. I didn't even know that [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1106.92s)]
*  this was like that. But this, this looks dope in terms of futurism. This looks kind of cool too, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1113.5600000000002s)]
*  but overall, overall, wait, Chev Chevrolet Corvette, EV and SUV. Yes. I know. I know the [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1120.3600000000001s)]
*  E series Grandeur is exactly what I'm looking for. This is precisely what I mean. The problem is this [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1129.24s)]
*  is a concept car and it's not going to be out. I don't think this is a real car that you can [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1134.84s)]
*  purchase. Okay. They just made one to celebrate. Hassan Kartag is so shit. I'm dying. How are your [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1139.24s)]
*  car takes as so my shit I'm dying. How are your car takes as base as your political views? It's [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1145.24s)]
*  cause I'm an old man and we're around the same age. And that's probably why you also like the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1150.28s)]
*  tactile feel of analog shit rather than the cheap iPad that is easily replaceable, even though it [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1155.08s)]
*  runs into electrical complications and also can be manipulated with software updates that you might [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1161.64s)]
*  have to pay for down the line, like a goddamn DLC. It is profit seeking all the way down cars [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1166.68s)]
*  throughout most of history have been a thing that you purchase and can wear and tear all the way [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1173.0800000000002s)]
*  down into the ground where you can, you can drive it for fucking 40 years if you want to, if you [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1178.76s)]
*  take good key, if you, if you maintain decent upkeep, okay. The problem is there, there's a [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1183.8000000000002s)]
*  reason why they don't have those buttons anymore inside of the cars. There's a reason why everything [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1190.2s)]
*  is relegated to the fucking iPad, even though it literally makes no sense. You have to look at the [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1193.56s)]
*  fucking iPad while you're driving. That is because it's cheaper. It's cheaper overall, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1197.16s)]
*  because all of those buttons are separate parts that you have to manufacture and purchase [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1202.3600000000001s)]
*  and, and replacing cars and whatnot. Even though screens are obviously very distracting, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1207.64s)]
*  there is a necessity for tactile buttons because you're not supposed to, you're supposed to be [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1213.0800000000002s)]
*  focusing on the fucking road while you're tweaking the buttons. You don't have to touch shit. I mean, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1218.68s)]
*  you don't have to look at shit. You can just use buttons. Tactile feels an absolute necessity. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1222.8400000000001s)]
*  It's like very frustrating. It is incredibly fucking frustrating to me. I don't like it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1229.16s)]
*  And it's something that is something that all the, all the Chinese EVs have too. They love those [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1234.68s)]
*  bells and whistles. They have so much extra bloatware in the Chinese cars. And I don't give a [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1239.16s)]
*  shit about it. I'm sure that like, I mean, the market obviously responds positively to it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1246.12s)]
*  Clearly Chinese EVs dominate partially because of their price, but people do like all the bells [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1251.08s)]
*  and whistles. Like they love that. You know, you have the flashy led, you have the flashy led [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1256.4399999999998s)]

*  shit dude. Give me a car that looks cool. Give me a car that fucking looks cool is old school [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1265.8s)]
*  and has a decent engine in it. And I want like, you know, a level of trim that I am comfortable [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1273.24s)]
*  with that invokes luxury. Like my Toyota Camry sport edition, you know, I just don't care. I [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V372CDeSz-A&t=1279.9599999999998s)]
