# Who Is Truly Behind The Azerbaijan Plane Crash | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc)
*  It doesn't look like a f**king Ukrainian drone hit it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=0.0s)]
*  If anything, even if you were to take that seriously, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  you thought that you were trying to hit a f**king Ukrainian drone, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=6.08s)]
*  and you shot the f**king plane. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=9.52s)]
*  Even then, I don't know what the f**k Ukraine- [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Turn to that investigation into the deadly plane crash in Kazakhstan. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Experts pointing to signs that the airliner- [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=24.72s)]
*  This is so funny. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=27.52s)]
*  Won't Canada be a blue state with a lot of electoral votes? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=28.72s)]
*  That is- dude, peak liberalism is like, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=31.76s)]
*  hey man, I'm trying to see the positives here, okay? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=35.2s)]
*  The silver lining. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=39.2s)]
*  How will this- I know, I know my driver's joking. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=46.72s)]
*  He's not that much of a f**king lib. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=49.2s)]
*  I don't think anyone is that much of a lib. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  How would permanently annexing Canada benefit the Democratic Party? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=53.12s)]
*  Matt Iglesias reporting from Ottawa, soon to be American territory. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=58.08s)]
*  ...may have been brought down by Russian anti-aircraft fire, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=64.32s)]
*  and as Delecata has the latest, and as Good Morning. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=68.56s)]
*  Good morning. With the plane's black boxes have been recovered, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=72.08s)]
*  a commission has been set up to investigate the crash. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=74.96s)]
*  One US official tells ABC News Russia could be to blame, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  but this morning the Kremlin once again declining to comment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=80.72s)]
*  This morning, the investigation intensifying after the deadly plane crash of Azerbaijan [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=84.16s)]
*  Airlines Flight 8243. This cell phone video captures the terrifying moment [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=88.72s)]
*  when the plane is seen hurtling toward the ground, suddenly leveling out, then regaining altitude. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=93.84s)]
*  Moments later, the aircraft quickly descending before crashing in a ball of fire. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=100.24s)]
*  Footage from inside the cabin shows the unsettling moments before the crash, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=104.72s)]
*  with visible damage to the plane's wing. Passengers sit with oxygen masks, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=108.56s)]
*  life vests resting on seats. Shortly after survivors were pulled from the wreckage, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=112.56s)]
*  small holes were seen scattered across the fuselage. Now, a US official and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=117.28s)]
*  Azeri government source tell ABC News there are indications that the plane was likely hit by a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=121.68s)]
*  Russian anti-aircraft system. Certainly there are lots of indicators to point towards a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  down of that aircraft. Andrew Nicholson runs Osprey, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=132.88s)]
*  a company that advises carriers flying in the region. He pointed to photos of the plane's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=135.6s)]
*  wreckage that appear to show what he says is damage consistent with surface to air fire. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=139.68s)]
*  There are no scuffs or bumps or dents that would also indicate, you know, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=144.56s)]
*  aircraft or birds hitting the aircraft fuselage and also the direction of the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=148.0s)]
*  shrapnel, which looks like it's coming from below. The aircraft itself torn apart on impact, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=152.88s)]
*  its tail upside down, but the Kremlin urging the public to wait for the results of the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=159.12s)]
*  investigation. The plane taking off Christmas morning from Azerbaijan's capital Baku, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=163.76s)]
*  initially heading to Grozny before abruptly deviating from its course, flying across the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=168.48s)]
*  Caspian Sea and crashing in Kazakhstan. Of the 67 people on board, 38 were killed. Remarkably, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=173.44s)]
*  29 survived. This morning, people gathered to mourn those lost in the crash as some survivors [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  returned home for further treatment. And the crash prompting comparisons to the 2014 downing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=187.12s)]
*  of a Malaysian Airlines flight, which investigators determined was shot down by Russian forces [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=193.2s)]
*  in Ukraine. Wit. Investigators taking a close look at those similarities and as thank you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=198.32s)]
*  We start with the major developments surrounding the plane crash that killed 38 people in Kazakhstan [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=203.6s)]
*  on Christmas Day. An investigation carried out by Azerbaijan Airlines has now blamed external, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=208.64s)]
*  physical and technical interference for the crash. It comes amid growing questions about whether or [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=215.12s)]
*  not the plane was shot down. The plane was flying from the Azerbaijani capital Baku [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=220.88s)]
*  to the Russian city of Grozny before crashing near the city of Aktau. It had diverted from an [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=227.28s)]
*  area of southern Russia where Moscow has used its air defense systems against Ukrainian drones. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=233.76s)]
*  Experts have said that the pattern of the holes in the plane's fuselage could have been caused by [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=240.56s)]
*  damage from a Russian air defense system. The Kremlin says it's too soon to say what caused [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=245.52s)]
*  the crash. Well, correspondent Alice Porter joins me now. A lot we don't know, Alice, but what do we [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=251.84s)]
*  know? Well, this is a major development from Azerbaijan Airlines based on preliminary findings. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=258.32s)]
*  They say the cause of the plane crash was external, physical and technical interference, which suggests [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=264.24s)]
*  whatever happened on Wednesday certainly wasn't accidental or human error. Now, we know at least [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=270.16s)]
*  38 people were killed and 29 people miraculously survived this plane crash, but there's huge [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  speculation as to who was responsible for the crash in the first place. Quite quickly, as you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=282.48s)]
*  were just saying, that people were pointing the finger at Russia and particularly concerned about [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=287.44000000000005s)]
*  whether Russian drones may have mistakenly shot it down. Now, a spokesman for the Kremlin said that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=292.0s)]
*  they didn't want to give any assessments until an official investigation had made their conclusions. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=297.52s)]
*  They have suggested that the pilot may have attempted an emergency landing after a bird strike, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=303.28s)]
*  but today we've also been hearing from the Russian aviation authority, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=308.4s)]
*  Rosovie Astia, that said around the time of the crash, they're saying that Ukrainian drones [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=312.08s)]
*  were operating in the area of Grozny where the flight was bound for. So they're clearly pointing [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=317.76s)]
*  the finger at the Ukrainians. Clearly, there doesn't look like a Ukrainian drone hit it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=323.04s)]
*  If anything, even if you were to take that seriously, you thought that you were trying [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=328.24s)]
*  to hit a Ukrainian drone and you shot the plane. Even then, I don't know what the Ukrainian drones [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=333.36s)]
*  will be doing in that territory. You know, clearly this plane crash is going to have some quite [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  significant geopolitical ramifications as time goes on and we get more information. But what we [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=346.0s)]
*  do know is that the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=351.68s)]
*  cause of it was external physical and technical interference. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vto45k3E5Xc&t=356.98s)]
