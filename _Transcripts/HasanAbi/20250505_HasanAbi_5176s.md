# Israel Just Announced Its Final Solution Plan | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU)
*  You know how the we have the 22 vets a day number in the United States of America? Some of the some [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=0.0s)]
*  of the heinous shit that the Israeli occupying forces done in Gaza is like an Abu Ghraib every [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=6.32s)]
*  day. So that number is going to be far higher. Like this is going to have inevitably karmic damage [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=13.36s)]
*  to our cosmic damage in the form of karmic justice. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=21.12s)]
*  And what are we doing? Let's freaking get into it. There's a lot to cover today. Israeli officials [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=30.4s)]
*  detailed plans to seize all of Gaza and occupied indefinitely. My ears just exploded. Would you [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=34.8s)]
*  rewatch Hunter Hunter and preferably starting with the 1999 version soon? No. Why are you asking me [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=41.6s)]
*  that Nancy Pelosi's pressuring Jordan to take more children from Gaza and a suppose who was [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  longstanding friendship with Abdullah took matters into our own hands last week had a blunt [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=51.6s)]
*  conversation with Jordan's ambassador with us Dina Kowar about Amman not accepting a sufficient [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  number of sick guys and children. I mean, okay, that's fine. Great. That should happen. Okay. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=58.64s)]
*  That's like bandaid ridiculous that we don't even have the bandaid at this moment, but [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  hello. There is also a much larger problem here, which is, you know, the fact that we have [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=73.68s)]
*  a genocide taking place. Like why are those children starving? Why are those children suffering [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=81.04s)]
*  because of Israel? There's some breaking news. There's a major development in the middle East. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  Israeli officials tell the associated press that a new plan has been approved to seize all the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  territory in Gaza and then occupy it indefinitely. MTS tie up has the latest for you from London. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=95.44s)]
*  MTS. Good morning to you, Gail. Good morning. Well, the approval by Israel's cabinet of the plan [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  about three worlds by obviously the entirety of the first chapter is basically him saying [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  that Iraqis were victims of Zionism and missed their home after they were pushed due to Arab [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=110.72s)]
*  nationalism, but pulled to Israel due to Zionism. He talks about a nostalgia for Baghdad. His [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=114.56s)]
*  grandparents had when they were forced to go to Israel. Yeah. Also Israel was like pretty [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=119.36s)]
*  ruthless to a lot of the Arab Jews initially. Like, um, was it was a Bangurian who said that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=124.16s)]
*  they're like lower than dust or something like they're desert people Ashkenazi Jews initially [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=131.36s)]
*  were not very fond of Ashkenazi Jews weren't very fond of like the, uh, the Arab Jews initially. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=136.08s)]
*  Like that was, there was the same dynamic of like Western, unironic, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=142.08s)]
*  Western white supremacist thought internally within Israel as well. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=146.88s)]
*  This is part of the reason why a lot of the most rabid supporters of the state of Israel are often [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=153.76s)]
*  Arab Jews like it to my bang of ear, also from Iraq, Arab, Kurdish, uh, Jew, HMR Bang of ear. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=160.24s)]
*  I just had Turkish food on your recommendation for the first time the other day. God damn. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=168.08s)]
*  Don't I boo good. It make buck love with the shifts left so hard. Yeah. It's fantastic. All [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=170.8s)]
*  right. Let's see. Let's lock in. Let's lock in. Let's talk about the serious. Um, let's talk about [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  the serious subject matter. Remember in a few years ago when people were screaming that Israel [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=180.0s)]
*  would never want to occupy Gaza since they left in 2005. Yeah. No, it's, uh, it's because they, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=183.44s)]
*  October 7, they have to there's you just force. They had their hands forced. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Matic shift in this already brutal and grinding war and comes as the Israeli military called up [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  tens of thousands of reservists shoulders just this weekend. No critics inside Israel, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=199.76s)]
*  most notably the hostages and missing families forum have lashed out at the plan calling it, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  and I'm quoting here a failed strategy since none of the 59 remaining hostages have been freed [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=211.28s)]
*  since Israel broke a ceasefire with Hamas six weeks ago and resumed its bombing campaign. Now [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=217.2s)]
*  the forum also said the plan to expand military operations in Gaza again, I'm quoting here was [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=222.88s)]
*  against the will of over 70% of the people in Israel. Now, if implemented, hundreds of thousands [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=228.72s)]
*  of already displaced Palestinians will be pushed to southern Gaza, only worsening an already dire [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=235.92s)]
*  humanitarian crisis for two months. Now Israel has blocked all food, water and medicine from [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  entering the Palestinian territory, triggering what aid agencies are calling the worst humanitarian [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=247.6s)]
*  crisis there since the violence began nearly one and a half years ago. Violence, which also saw the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=253.04s)]
*  Iran backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. I think one of the, one of the lesser considered aspects of this [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  conversation from Israel, which is now pushing for the final solution, by the way, they, they want a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=268.88s)]
*  majority child population that they've starved out for the past two months. Okay. Remember, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=276.0s)]
*  this is a majority children population. There's a reason why 70% of their 70% of the people that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=282.4s)]
*  they kill are either children, women, or the elderly, because that's just what the population is. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=290.4s)]
*  Okay. So after starving them, destroying their cities in its entirety and starving them for two [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=298.56s)]
*  months, now they're going to go in and do a full blown military, full blown military occupation. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=305.12s)]
*  And obviously this is Nazi stuff. I mean, this is the Holocaust. This is the final solution. They [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=312.8s)]
*  are doing it in broad daylight and they're doing it within the legal confines that they've created [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=318.08s)]
*  for themselves. Just like the Nazis, what they were doing to the Jews were legal by their own [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  estimations, by their own designs when they implemented the Nuremberg race laws. Right? So [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=328.56s)]
*  it's, it's a, it's terrifying. The one thing I will say, the one thing I will say where you get [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=335.76s)]
*  these numbers though, what do you, what do you think this is a gotcha? Like, what, what do you mean? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=341.52s)]
*  I get them from the health ministry and also numerous other NGOs and also the United Nations. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=347.12s)]
*  Like, where do you anyway? Yeah. They're doing a final solution on Gaza. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=354.4s)]
*  They're doing a final solution on the Palestinians. They're the one aspect that is less [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  covered in this matter. However, is if they even have like, if they even have the military [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  strength to be able to do this, do they have the numbers to do this? I know that there is [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=369.84s)]
*  definitely a lot of appetite for, for people in the war cabinet for sure. Especially the more [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  radical elements within the war cabinet. But I don't know if there is enough manpower at this [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=382.48s)]
*  stage, but I have not checked in. Like I haven't been looking at the, I have not been looking at [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=390.32s)]
*  the, the numbers of like, or the drama that's happening with like forcible conscripts or the, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  the reserve is not returning to duty because at a certain point, at a certain point, they're gonna [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=405.68s)]
*  have a hard time filling the ranks in order to do a permanent military occupation. You have to fill [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=413.6s)]
*  the ranks. And I don't know if they have enough manpower. I genuinely don't know if they have [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=420.08s)]
*  enough manpower to do so, or if they have enough appetite to do so. Cause like there's a lot of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=425.92s)]
*  their, their regular lives. You know what I mean? There's a lot of people who are like, okay, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=429.76s)]
*  I've done enough child murder. Like, can I please go back to my marketing job? Like I miss my family. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=433.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? The impact of all of that violence will also only be seen [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=438.64s)]
*  in a decade. We haven't even gotten there yet. You know how the, we have the 22 vets a day number [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  in the United States of America. Some of the, some of the heinous shit that the Israeli occupying [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=452.0s)]
*  forces done in Gaza is like an Abu Ghraib every day. So that number is going to be far higher. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=457.12s)]
*  Like this is going to have inevitably karmic damage to, or cosmic damage in the form of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=464.96s)]
*  karmic justice to Israel for sure. So there is no, like, I mean, you can bomb these buildings over [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=472.8s)]
*  and over again, these hollowed out buildings over and over again, but like inevitably, if you want [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=482.72s)]
*  to do a military occupation, you need manpower. If you have manpower, there is going to be, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=485.84s)]
*  there is going to be resistance against that manpower. There is going to be a tunnel warfare, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=490.88s)]
*  guerrilla warfare. Once again, Hamas has replenished its ranks, right? And then you got the Al Qassam [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=497.28s)]
*  brigades. You got all of these other like a militancy formations that are going to inevitably [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=504.88s)]
*  take out soldiers over and over again. And I don't think that Israel has the capacity to keep [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=511.04s)]
*  that operation up with straightforward manpower, like just boots on the ground, military manpower [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  without American intervention. So therein lies the question, does America intervene? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  Do we see the United States of America actually invade Gaza? Is that what they're going to do? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=529.2s)]
*  Cause I don't, I don't think we're, I don't think Israel has the capacity. I don't think Israel has [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=534.08s)]
*  the capacity to continue the war. Obviously the cost of Gaza war escalation could top [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=540.64s)]
*  15.4 billion threatening Israeli budget stability. You have a port shutdowns. Obviously you have, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=544.8s)]
*  you're right. I'm a nine 11 era of it. I didn't even see combat, but our friends who died in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  Afghanistan, people like us are anti-American as fuck, but it's not even, it's not even just that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=556.96s)]
*  Like a lot of the breaking the silence guys are on ironically people that have actually participated [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=561.6s)]
*  in sieges in Gaza. And then that made them grossed out to the whole fucking design. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=565.12s)]
*  And that was like their wake up call. But having said that we also have the PTSD side of things, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=570.64s)]
*  like this is signaling societal collapse, especially when you consider that the Israeli [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=575.92s)]
*  population numbers are constantly fulfilling itself, like filling up the ranks with the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=582.48s)]
*  Haredi population. They're having like six to eight kids. Okay. Those guys don't have to serve [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=587.92s)]
*  in the military, but those guys are also not getting the proper education that Israel wants [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=592.88s)]
*  to show to the Western world to show the Western world that they are like, just like France or, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=598.96s)]
*  you know, just like any other normal Western country, we have arts, we celebrate, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=604.72s)]
*  we celebrate education, we celebrate the arts, we celebrate scientific accomplishments and whatnot. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=611.2s)]
*  So like if you're, if the only people that don't have PTSD that remain in Israel, that's like [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=615.12s)]
*  becoming the next generation of Israel are all young Haredi Jews who only get a religious [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  education, then like the societal makeup of Israel is going to dramatically change. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=626.88s)]
*  Do you see what I mean? And you can't, you don't get the benefit from a steady flow of [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=633.12s)]
*  Western intervention and Western aid and Western support and an expenditure of [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=642.48s)]
*  Western political capital in defense of your genocide. If your country doesn't look [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=649.04s)]
*  Western, I feel like they will inevitably lose their favorite client status if they can't keep up [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=654.72s)]
*  an incredibly sophisticated, an incredibly sophisticated influence peddling operation [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=662.24s)]

*  It's more so, I mean, it is a, it is a little bit like getting mad at idiocracy for you, for, for [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=674.4s)]
*  having a eugenicist slant, but it's, it's idiocracy. We're, we're experiencing that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  here in the United States of America as well, but it is kind of like idiocracy where, yeah, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=686.24s)]
*  the guys that are having a lot of children that allow Israel to no longer have, to allow Israel [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=691.36s)]
*  to not have any sort of like birth rate decline, those guys don't serve. They don't serve, they [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=698.08s)]
*  don't go to the same schools. They don't care about education in the same way. They have very [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=703.68s)]
*  different opinions on like women's position in society. And the more Israel becomes a majority [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=708.48s)]
*  her ready population, which is it's not there yet, but the more Israel becomes like a majority [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  her ready population like that, the less likely it is that it can keep up. It's a sophisticated [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=721.04s)]
*  espionage opportunity, sophisticated espionage operations or even sophisticated influence [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=727.04s)]
*  peddling operations in the West as an ex-hariri. I can assure you, we receive little to no education. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=732.88s)]
*  Yeah. It's mostly just like, it's mostly just like religious education, right? So it's, it's, I mean, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  it's just they're cooked, they're cooked regardless, if that makes sense. I mean, the West supports [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=743.92s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and there aren't Western looking in any way, to be honest, if you think that like [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=749.84s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is a weapon to wield against Yemen, okay. As long as it is a, a, a part of the defense [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=754.88s)]
*  initiative that defends Israel's interest in the region, as long as it has a shit ton of oil, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=762.0s)]
*  but Saudi Arabia is not a cl- a favored client state in the same way that [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=767.04s)]
*  Israel is. No country is a favored client state in the same way that Israel is. Saudi Arabia is just [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=771.6s)]
*  an important bulwark against Iranian intervention in the region because Iran is outside of our [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=779.36s)]
*  sphere of influence. The double irony here, of course, is that we are trying to Israelify [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=783.52s)]
*  the United States of America. A lot of our politicians look to Israel's fascism and say, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=788.72s)]
*  we liked that. We want that here. We should do more of that, please. Like there is a [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=792.8s)]
*  truly terrifying number of politicians who I think on ironically look to the design of Israeli [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=797.5999999999999s)]
*  society and where it has gone over the course of the past couple of decades and has decided [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=804.4s)]
*  this is good. We should do this, but for Christianity, Christian Sharia, you know, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=810.56s)]
*  huh? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=815.12s)]
*  Israel is less a client and more the USA's pet. I feel yes. I mean, it's not the, the favored [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=820.4s)]
*  client nation status is just like a designation is official. Does it an unofficial designation [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=826.72s)]
*  block the Yemeni do the piss off so many people. It is, it is not in the sphere of Western influence [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=833.76s)]
*  is in the sphere of Iranian influence. That's it. That's the major issue. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=840.0s)]
*  Launch a ballistic missile on Sunday, which hit the perimeter of Israel's main airport. Prime [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=846.72s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to respond to the attack saying Iran would also face [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=852.4s)]
*  consequences from the strike. Yeah, they have to pull Iran into this and Iran has demonstrated [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=858.16s)]
*  restraint over and over again, or some analysts will say Iran uses the Houthis as a way to respond [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=865.68s)]
*  to Israel as a way to retaliate against Israel. But Iran overall has demonstrated major restraint [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=872.16s)]
*  throughout this, throughout this process. That much is obviously clear, especially in comparison [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  to fucking what Israel is doing. The only time Israel actually shows restraint is when they're [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=882.16s)]
*  trying to retaliate against Iran, ironically enough. But the reality of the matter is [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=887.4399999999999s)]
*  Israel needs to bring Iran into the fold because there are two reasons for that. One, I think it's, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=894.16s)]
*  this is a part of America's grand design in the region. I think this is definitely a part of [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=901.76s)]
*  America's grand design because Iran, if there were two poles on the planet with two hegemonic [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=906.64s)]
*  powers competing against one another, they're going to need energy and China needs to get it [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  from Iran if they can't get plus group. And America's number one goal in the next 20 to 10 [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=920.64s)]
*  year timeline is to take this war directly to China. That's part of the reason why they want [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=928.48s)]
*  to pack up the whole Russia Ukraine stuff. And that's precisely the reason why they are letting [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=934.16s)]
*  Israel go absolute monster mode everywhere in the region so that they can, they can do this big [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=939.12s)]
*  destabilization and then restabilization with the Israeli design, like restabilization, where a lot [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=948.0s)]
*  of these areas are under firm Israel security commitments and Israel control so that they can [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=954.08s)]
*  have some semblance of security and some semblance of stability rather for American national [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=962.96s)]
*  interests and maybe even exert influence, exert pressure over our allies there to cut off the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=969.28s)]
*  energy supply to China. That is the goal. That's why I also say American foreign policy will swing [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=979.12s)]
*  sometimes wildly, but it's often still directionally in the same, it's always directionally in the same [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=985.6s)]
*  agenda towards the same agenda. But there are obviously differences in opinion along the way. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=994.32s)]
*  Oftentimes it's the Republicans that push it even further and further, right? More [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1001.2s)]
*  it to more insane places. And then the Democrats don't do anything to pull it back because they [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1005.6s)]
*  also are in line with the same agenda. So is Pollywood just a modern day Nazi propaganda? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1010.32s)]
*  Is that a little too far? No, it's not far. I, I look, it's up to you guys. You need to be very [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1016.32s)]
*  well equipped when you're talking about Israel, Palestine related things in order not to come [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1023.36s)]
*  across like you're antisemitic, because a lot of the language even on accident can come across [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1028.16s)]
*  like that. And I perfectly understand that, which is why I wouldn't recommend to the average person [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1033.92s)]
*  to make this comparison, because most people still at this stage will be like, Whoa, I don't know [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1039.04s)]
*  about that. That's crazy. But I do not shy away from making the comparison of Israel and Nazi [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1045.04s)]
*  Germany, because I think we have, we have definitely reached that level. But you know, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1050.96s)]
*  the more the, the less, the less incisive language you use is just to say it's fascist, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1055.44s)]
*  because it is fascist, just like the Nazis, it is exterminationist. It is built on supremacist [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1063.2s)]
*  ideology, just like the Nazis were. But, you know, I don't think it's in any way, shape or form [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1068.64s)]
*  inappropriate to make this comparison. Like, as a Jewish person, I always compare Israel to the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1077.44s)]
*  Nazis. Yeah. NATO officials came to Japan recently to beg us to make more weapons and build up to [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1082.0s)]
*  SDF supposedly for Russia. But I think it's the goal of fighting China too. No, it's definitely [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1086.4s)]
*  the goal of fighting China. This is what last night's Israeli airstrikes left in Gaza to be [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1090.0800000000002s)]
*  buried the morning after. The remains of a child so small, they could almost be held in one hand. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1097.8400000000001s)]
*  Now dead before they had lived. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1104.8000000000002s)]
*  We hope that everyone will stand with us to stop this bloodshed and stop this extermination. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1111.44s)]
*  We are people who love life. We are people who hope that the war will stop and that we will live [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1116.0s)]
*  in peace, security and safety. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1120.96s)]
*  This is the human cost of an offensive that is set to intensify if Israel carries out its new [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1125.44s)]
*  plan to seize more of the Strip. The Israeli military already controls around half of Gaza, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1130.64s)]
*  as well as corridors dividing the region. Government officials have reportedly said [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1138.56s)]
*  the new offensive will now capture the entire territory. This would mean pushing the population [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  back south again. This is what we will do. We will for its own protection. The Israeli [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1148.4s)]
*  prime minister suggested the military would not retreat. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1155.92s)]
*  Is he just like, like what's going on there? Is he trying to be like, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1186.0s)]
*  haha, what are you going to do about it? That's me. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1190.64s)]
*  Tolstoy could never imagine particles to this degree. No, it's not Tolstoy, it's Trotsky. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1193.8400000000001s)]

*  that we will have nothing to offer to people and that's why we urge the international community [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1270.24s)]

*  does not ask for ID. I'm not going to lie dude, it blows my mind what is going on because like, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1303.2s)]
*  if there were right now in Gaza, I think the dynamic would look very different. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1309.6s)]
*  Like I think that there wouldn't even be any protests. Like I know that there are people in [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1317.9199999999998s)]
*  Israel, like I think over time standing together, like a lot of the liberal Zionists that are even [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1323.9199999999998s)]
*  in movements like standing together either went full tilt, Kahane's or when in the opposite [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1330.8799999999999s)]
*  direction and became more firm in their conviction against like Israel's genocide, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1335.84s)]
*  but their numbers are nothing in comparison to the broader Israeli society. Like this is, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  this is what I have seen from my own personal experiences from what I've seen in the Western [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1350.3999999999999s)]
*  world, but what I've seen also in Israel as well. And I'm sure some of the Israeli Hassan [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1356.72s)]
*  Abiy heads could confirm or deny this. I don't know, but like after October 7, a lot of the [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1360.72s)]
*  liberal Zionists that were at the peak of like the Israeli liberal coalition that was like, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1367.44s)]
*  Oh, let's do peace. Let's do a two state solution. Let's do, you know, let's hold hands with the [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1373.6000000000001s)]

*  people that have demonstrated over and over again, not talking about the anti Zionists. Okay. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1384.16s)]
*  But people that have protested and demonstrated, which is one of the more popular, one of the [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1388.32s)]
*  larger movements, basically in Israel, a lot of those guys I was checking in were going crazy. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1391.6799999999998s)]
*  They were baying for blood. Okay. They were just going wild. Right. And then it's like over time, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1398.32s)]
*  I think as the depravity of the military operations became clear for some, some got way more [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1405.6799999999998s)]
*  radicalized in the opposite direction and others, and others became, I think more committed to [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1413.84s)]
*  anti Zionism than they ever did before, but those numbers are tiny still they're marginal. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1421.04s)]
*  So without hostages, cause like the big, the mass movements that happen in Israel, the largest [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1425.84s)]
*  category of like anti-government protests that are coming out are coming from hostage families [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1430.32s)]
*  and their friends and people that want a ceasefire specifically to take out the hostages. Those [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1434.1599999999999s)]
*  people have been pulled in the past as well. And when they actually get pulled, they still say like, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1438.48s)]
*  no, just keep the war going after, but just like, get our hostages out. And Benjamin Netanyahu on [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1442.88s)]
*  the other hand, will not commit to, to even doing that, which is why a lot of people are very [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1447.2s)]
*  frustrated. There's the reason why in Israel, in Israeli media, especially with the last ceasefire [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1454.72s)]
*  was taking place, there were family members of Israeli hostages that were writing letters to [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1461.68s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu being like, you are the reason why this deal is not taking place, which was [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1466.24s)]
*  correct. You are bringing up idiotic additional spoilers into the ceasefire negotiation, like [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1470.16s)]
*  not removing military presence from the, from the Philadelphia corridor, the Rafa border crossing [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1477.1200000000001s)]
*  with Egypt, right? Like all of this stuff that they added onto the deal over and over again [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1481.44s)]
*  was specifically done so that Netanyahu could always say, Oh, I don't want to do this. I don't [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1486.16s)]
*  want to actually do a ceasefire. And, and I think I don't know what the dynamic would look like. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1490.24s)]
*  Like Israel's made peace deals with Palestine five times up until October 7th. Yeah. Those [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1495.68s)]
*  aren't real peace deals, brother. What are we talking about? This is like pre-October [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1500.5600000000002s)]
*  seven Hasbro is where we're at now. What do you, what do you mean? Like what's the, what's the [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1504.16s)]
*  logical conclusion of this argument that you're trying to present here that like they did peace [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1509.3600000000001s)]
*  deals with Palestine and they just Palestinians couldn't keep up their end on those peace deals. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1512.96s)]
*  So they must be ethnically cleansed. Is that your argument? Can you say your, your conclusion? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1517.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. See exactly. Because Palestine didn't want peace. Remember chatters. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1522.64s)]
*  The dynamic is always the same. Okay. Here's what happens. There's a siege that takes place. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1528.3200000000002s)]
*  They wipe out like a hundred to a thousand people. They blow up a bunch of buildings. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1535.3600000000001s)]
*  Then they fuck off. Israel does. Okay. And then there is a treaty as a ceasefire treaty. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1540.48s)]
*  Israel then continues doing what it's doing in the West bank, which is of course, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1547.6000000000001s)]
*  ruining the lives of the Palestinians under this illegal occupation, where they keep harming them, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1552.88s)]
*  especially during Ramadan, where they'll actively go out of their way to disrupt travel, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1558.72s)]
*  disrupt travel to the mosque, disrupt the lives of Palestinians that are literally engaging in, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1568.0800000000002s)]
*  of, of just going to the Alex mosque and praying. And that provocation is always like there before [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1575.92s)]
*  that provocation happens, knowing full well that that provocation is going to happen. Okay. Knowing [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1586.48s)]
*  full of that provocation is going to happen. Hamas will release a statement. They will say, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1592.24s)]
*  don't do this. Okay. Do not do this. And then Israel will do it anyway. And then Hamas will [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1596.96s)]
*  turn around and fucking lob a couple of rockets that immediately get intercepted by iron dome. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1604.24s)]
*  Israel will use that as an opportunity to do another siege. This is what this man is talking [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1609.1200000000001s)]
*  about when he says, the, you know, there Hamas always disrupts peace negotiations or whatever. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1614.4s)]
*  It's not true. Okay. Hold on. This guy woke up thinking it's October eight, giving us all the [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1622.56s)]
*  talking points. No, he woke up thinking it's, he woke up thinking it's October six, ironically enough. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1627.76s)]
*  Also, it is pretty funny to say this because if this kind of, this kind of rhetoric was incredibly [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1635.04s)]
*  effective in the Western world for years, Palestinians were no partner in peace. They said, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1641.84s)]
*  right now, I just see one side hating the others, the other, and the other having to defend itself. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1648.32s)]
*  Yeah, that is what's going on. That is actually what's going on. One side is defending itself and [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1652.96s)]
*  that side is the Palestinians and the side that's hating them is Israel. So you're actually not wrong. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1659.44s)]
*  You're just, you've flipped the dynamic and it's on its head because you have sympathies for Israel. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1666.48s)]
*  It's I get it. Like, I know where this comes from. You're wrong, but I understand why you're wrong. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1672.16s)]
*  Anyway, the thing I wanted to maintain, the thing I wanted to mention here is, is more so about [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1677.2s)]
*  propaganda and how it works. Okay. Pre October seven, if you tried to describe how disruptive [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1682.56s)]
*  Israel was in these numerous ceasefire negotiations where they never actually gave a fair deal [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1689.28s)]
*  and they never actually wanted to implement any sort of fair deal whatsoever. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1695.44s)]
*  Okay. If, if you were to describe that to people, they would not understand it. They'd be like, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1699.28s)]
*  what do you mean? Bill Clinton even said that it was, you know, Palestinians that were just no [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1704.8799999999999s)]
*  partner in peace. But now you, every single person in this community, at least has seen [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1709.36s)]
*  the exact ways in which the, the depra repugnant American administration lies at the behest of [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1717.9199999999998s)]
*  Israel and how Israel behaves throughout the ceasefire negotiation process. So now you know, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1723.84s)]
*  because you saw it over the course of the past year and a half, you saw exactly how Israel operates [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1728.4799999999998s)]
*  in these negotiations. And you saw exactly how the American government runs cover for Israel [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1734.16s)]
*  throughout these ceasefire negotiations. So looking at what has unfolded over the last year [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1739.68s)]
*  and a half will give you a very, will give you a better understanding of the reasons as to why [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1746.88s)]
*  previous ceasefire negotiations or, or any sort of pathway towards peace was completely cast aside [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1752.5600000000002s)]
*  by the responsible party, Israel. Do you understand? This is also why it's like a lot of the old [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1760.32s)]
*  Hasbro doesn't work. A lot of the old Hasbro doesn't work anymore. And it's not just because [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1767.28s)]
*  people can see directly what Israel is doing, but a lot of the old Hasbro doesn't work anymore [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1773.6s)]
*  because people have just become more aware, like people have become more aware of the way that [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1778.08s)]
*  Israel has operated throughout the past year and a half. And that completely eviscerates all of the [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1784.1599999999999s)]
*  carefully calculated, ah, historical ways in which this process has been taught to those who even [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1792.96s)]
*  care to learn about it in America. I saw it, I'm scared. You figured it out and you're loud about [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1803.04s)]
*  it. I'm scared for your safety. No, but this is the irony is this is what I've been saying for years. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1807.36s)]
*  This isn't new. It's just a lot of people have only recently figured it out. That's it. That's [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1813.44s)]
*  it. I've heard Israel's fake and AI voice noise in Syria to put throughs against the Syrian government. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1820.56s)]
*  Is Israel's justification for the plan to seize Gaza that is necessary to save the hostages? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1826.96s)]
*  No, ironically enough, they've completely given up on even entertaining that idea. They've given up [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1831.68s)]
*  on even doing propaganda in that, in that direction. They completely dropped it. They openly said [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1838.8s)]
*  last week, Benjamin and Yao came out and said, hostages are secondary to our much larger, much [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1847.76s)]
*  more consequential plan of complete extermination of Hamas. Hostage negotiations are a hurdle. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1854.24s)]
*  And he actually said it literally a day after Ethan and Sam argued against one another [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1860.96s)]
*  after Ethan was like, Oh, well, if Hamas released all the hostages, then you know, Israel was stopped. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1869.28s)]
*  Yeah. He then is about to go live. I'm a fallen fan. I can't believe Ethan actually won the debate [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1873.84s)]
*  against Sam Cedar. And you is shocking. It's not shocking. Thank you, tiny person. It is shocking. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1878.08s)]
*  Many things are shocking to you. I think if you, if you feel that way, like, Oh my God, why is there [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1884.0s)]
*  a big ball in the sky that comes out every morning? That is scary. Is that fire? What is fire [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1890.8s)]
*  shocking? Yeah. I mean, this basically came out like a day after Sam and Ethan had that conversation [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1897.28s)]
*  in any house is destroying Hamas more important than free hostages, which any attention, if you [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1903.12s)]
*  were paying any attention to the dynamic at all, you would have recognized that you would have [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1908.0s)]
*  recognized that months ago, we are finally going to conquer Gaza. We are no longer afraid of the [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1914.16s)]
*  word occupation. Finance minister Bezalos Montes told a pro settler conference in an online [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1919.52s)]
*  discussion. Israel may seize all of Gaza and expanded operation. Officials say summary door [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1924.32s)]
*  open for ceasefire talks as Trump heads to the region. Military will hold territories. It seizes [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1929.92s)]
*  Israeli officials say blockade remains on aid for now. Tens of thousands of reserves will be called [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1933.6s)]
*  up. Humanitarian agencies condemn Israel's new aid plans. See, there is also an incredibly nefarious [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1938.24s)]
*  side of this, which is that they are going to do something that is totally illegal that they wanted [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1943.2s)]
*  to do in the past as well under the Biden administration. Apparently, according to reporting [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1951.6s)]
*  that I read on it, at least that even the Biden administration was like, ah, you can't do that. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1954.9599999999998s)]
*  They want to distribute aid with the military. They want to control who gets aid in the Gaza strip. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1959.1999999999998s)]
*  That in and of itself is insane. I mean, this is this is literally this is literally Russia shit. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1967.52s)]
*  Okay. This is what the American government was like yelling to Russia about over and over again. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1975.52s)]
*  I mean, it's it's it's not any like even the Russian annexation occupation was was a bloody [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1980.8s)]
*  affair. It was incredibly deadly. But like, at no point is there is there not regular commerce [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1987.9199999999998s)]
*  happening, right? No, it's not even American shit. No, no, it's not even American shit. This is worse. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=1994.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm telling you, this is worse than Russia shit. This is worse than America shit. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2001.36s)]
*  This is this is straight up like picking and choosing who gets to eat food. Like it's [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2005.52s)]
*  absolutely worse than Russia shit. It is absolutely worse than America shit. This is [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2012.0s)]
*  stuff that I mean, it is it's Nazi shit. Yeah. Israel's government here. Israel's government [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2017.76s)]
*  has approved a sweeping plan to seize all of Gaza indefinitely occupied its territory and [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2023.9199999999998s)]

*  the territories escalate attacks and block Hamas from accessing humanitarian aid. The plan also [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2041.52s)]
*  includes moving the Gaza population to population south for its defense and intensifying bombing [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2045.9199999999998s)]
*  campaigns. There's no timeline for withdrawal. I also want to mention something. I didn't really [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2050.4s)]
*  cover this as much. I didn't really cover this aspect as much, but like the Israeli military [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2054.7999999999997s)]
*  by way of infiltration and sabotage has armed criminal elements within the Gaza strip. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2060.88s)]
*  Okay. They've given him like NATO weapons in the Gaza strip to go and run rampant on the aid. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2067.84s)]
*  Hamas as of I believe last night actually executed publicly executed numerous criminal gang members [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=2075.6800000000003s)]

*  is the united states of america and donald trump is not going to do that and biden was not going [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3557.2799999999997s)]
*  to do that either and didn't do that and we have no reason to believe the reality of the matter is [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3564.72s)]
*  we have no reason to believe that kamala would do anything different considering that she [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3570.72s)]
*  routinely said that she was lockstep into with the biden administration okay she said there's [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3574.56s)]
*  no daylight between her and biden and biden did the exact same shit on the optic side maybe biden [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3581.44s)]
*  and uh massage the narrative a little bit say oh i'm so mad at benjamin and yahoo but on the on the [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3588.2400000000002s)]
*  reality side they didn't care so the only options in this circumstance are to apply pressure [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3595.92s)]
*  militarily from other regional actors that make it as costly as possible for israel to continue [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3603.52s)]
*  this initiative uh internal struggle from anti-zionist all the way to hostage families [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3610.08s)]
*  that keep protesting against the israeli government and try to get people to refuse to go back on [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3616.48s)]
*  reserve duty as they are doing a call to arms and also potentially china european sanctions could [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3623.2s)]
*  help but i don't think i don't think european sanctions would uh i don't think european sanctions [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3630.88s)]
*  would help without american inter like europeans will not sanction israel without america i would [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3638.96s)]
*  be shocked if they did that like legitimately shocked if europe would actually take action [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3644.4s)]
*  against israel without america's go-ahead the reason why i say that is because [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3650.48s)]
*  germany is the responsible party for the international criminal court okay germany is [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3657.28s)]
*  not only the manufacturing engine and the the industrial engine of the entirety of the european [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3664.48s)]
*  union germany is the country that has basically designed the entirety of the european union [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3669.52s)]
*  they are the de facto controllers of the eu and the reason why i'm bringing up germany is because [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3676.4s)]
*  it's in their constitution that they must abide by the international criminal court because of [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3683.6s)]
*  you know the whole nazi stuff right and even then germany has been inconsistent in its messaging [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3689.04s)]
*  about whether or not they would arrest benjamin netanyahu and yoav galant once germany came out [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3696.2400000000002s)]
*  and said that it was over that means that they're getting their notes from the united states of [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3702.56s)]
*  america on this issue and they will not stray away from the united states i'll give you one [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3707.36s)]
*  additional example they don't probably give it they don't really give a shit about what israel [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3713.76s)]
*  does right european countries don't care about like the european politicians don't care about [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3719.84s)]
*  what israel is doing to the palestinians they don't care at all because you know they're killing [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3725.52s)]

*  russia they are legitimately fearful of russian like further russian occupation in the ukrainian [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3737.52s)]
*  territory and maybe even like russia spreading its invasion right they're afraid of that that is a [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3746.64s)]
*  legitimate fear that european politicians have and yet despite the despite all of their claims [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3754.24s)]
*  of how they are going to help ukraine separately from the united states of america if the u.s won't [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3763.3599999999997s)]
*  help ukraine we box all of this posturing took place they haven't actually stepped out of line [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3767.8399999999997s)]
*  with the interests of america at all in this process if you noticed the reason as to why they [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3774.3199999999997s)]
*  haven't is because they are still in my opinion very firmly within the the sphere of western [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3779.2s)]
*  influence the sphere of american influence so if they're not even stepping by the way germany do [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3787.12s)]
*  not control the eu eu as a parliament and commission do not speak about the eu if you're [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3792.3199999999997s)]
*  not from any eu country i'm from eu things are voted in the parliament okay thanks yeah germany [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3796.56s)]
*  has been very consistent they've said repeatedly that it would be unconscionable for an israeli [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3801.52s)]
*  state official to be arrested on german soil indirect like that is a direct violation of of [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3804.8s)]
*  the german constitution as far as like abiding by the international criminal court standards [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3809.44s)]
*  abiding by the international criminal court's arrest warrants that is insane okay stating that [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3814.0800000000004s)]
*  means that they care more about american interests and following america on this issue then then their [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3819.6000000000004s)]
*  own fucking constitution so that's something to consider as a middle-income american what can i [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3828.0800000000004s)]
*  do my day-to-day to make conditions and gaza better like i participate in bds list protest [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3833.92s)]
*  and donate where i can wondering if you have any options on action items yeah just doing that and [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3837.12s)]
*  continue to do that and continuing to try to get people to understand what is actually taking place [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3841.2000000000003s)]
*  in gaza is the best possible thing you can do change does not happen overnight it's marginal [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3847.6s)]
*  but as someone who has been as someone who has been an advocate for palestinians for the past [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3852.96s)]
*  decade and a half okay i will tell you that a lot of change has taken place in terms of the [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3859.12s)]
*  public sentiment in terms of the public attitude that has dramatically shifted so just you have to [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3866.08s)]
*  keep up the pressure that's it so as i was stating the discourse in germany is dead berlin announces [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3870.96s)]
*  city partnership with teleview today our new government is completely hopeless yeah look look [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3875.92s)]

*  the reason why i brought up the european partners in this process is because someone in the chat [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3885.2s)]
*  brought up the maybe europe maybe the eu would turn around and actually apply pressure to israel [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3890.16s)]
*  and i'm telling you that that is very unlikely if they actually decouple from american foreign [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3897.04s)]
*  policy interest in the region if they actually did that they could at least they could apply a lot of [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_0tUtt0ZSU&t=3902.72s)]
