# Trump Is Still Terrible | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI)
*  I pointed them out also and I was right on all of it, but they'll still do an investigation just to check it out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=0.0s)]
*  But I think that's yeah, they'll still do an investigation. Don't worry guys [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  I mean even though what I said is correct and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=8.8s)]
*  There probably doesn't need to be an investigation because what I said is correct, but they show they'll still do one [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=11.48s)]
*  Don't worry guys, but I got it. I got it me and rules me the president. I got it. I figured it out [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=16.96s)]
*  It's black people [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  And that's what he's saying things in fact if you look is black people it's the mentally is the intellectual disability [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=26.2s)]
*  Talented people is the it's the intellectually disabled overlooking runways [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  Oh, he's finally live [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  To forestall your implementation of tariffs tomorrow no [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=48.0s)]
*  Not right now [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=53.1s)]
*  Negotiating tool no, it's not [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=55.18s)]
*  Economic we have big deficits with as you know with all three of them [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=57.86s)]
*  And in one case they're sending massive amounts of fentanyl killing hundreds of thousands of people a year with the fentanyl the two cases [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=62.300000000000004s)]
*  They're making it possible for this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=69.38s)]
*  poison to get in number one and number two we have big deficits and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=72.18s)]
*  It's something we're doing and well we'll [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=77.38s)]
*  Possibly very substantially increase it or not. We'll see how it is, but [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=81.22s)]
*  It's a lot of money coming to the United States as you know we have about a 200 billion dollar deficit with [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=86.46s)]
*  With a candidate getting close to 200 billion dollars. It's they've treated us very unfairly [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=93.42s)]
*  And I say why should we be subsidizing Canada? They you know true king. Why should we? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=99.5s)]
*  We'll just see what happens. We'll see what happens that with Mexico. It's the same thing we have a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=110.5s)]
*  250 billion dollar deficit and we have a lot of people coming into the border and now we've largely stopped that but we stopped [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  That ourselves and I think they've done a fantastic job. You've seen the numbers have dropped almost zero [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=124.5s)]
*  But we've suffered under the past administration for years and years [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=130.62s)]
*  Millions of criminals coming into our country criminals people from jails from all over the world [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=135.7s)]
*  They come through Mexico, and they come through Canada to a lot of them come through Canada and a lot of fentanyl comes through [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  Canada and China makes the fentanyl you know China makes the fentanyl gives it to Mexico puts it through Canada puts it through [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=146.98s)]
*  different different places mostly Mexico, but also a lot through Canada and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=153.7s)]
*  So all three haven't treated us very well [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=159.26s)]
*  What did you talk about and do you think you need to ban more of the chips that they're selling to China? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=165.06s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, and I hadn't met him. He's the biggest in the world in terms of chips and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=169.54s)]
*  I [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=176.45999999999998s)]
*  Can't say what's gonna happen whether we had a meeting. It was good meeting [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=178.5s)]
*  But eventually we're gonna put tariffs on chips [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  We're gonna put tariffs on oil and gas that'll happen. Oh [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  The audio is on okay, I'm gonna hit it on mono don't worry hold on I'm gonna fix it [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=190.34s)]
*  We already have tariffs on steel and we've saved our steel industry [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=199.18s)]
*  But that was relatively small compared to what it'll be but we're gonna be putting tariffs on steel a little bit [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=202.9s)]
*  So it's good. I fixed it [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  Copper will take a little bit longer [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=211.18s)]
*  And that'll happen pretty quickly. It'll mean it'll be a great boost for our steel industry it'll [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=213.58s)]
*  Make our steel industry very strong [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=219.78s)]
*  If I didn't put the tariffs on years ago and steel which actually Biden left because it was so much money that they couldn't [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=222.46s)]
*  Do anything about I fixed it we would have lost we wouldn't have one steel mill in this country if I didn't do that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  We saved the steel industry [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=233.62s)]
*  so it was an honor to do it and I [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=235.94s)]
*  Think the people that love me most in the whole world the people that make steel [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=238.9s)]
*  But we're gonna be putting [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=242.82000000000002s)]
*  sometime [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=245.58s)]
*  This month next month, we're gonna be putting tariffs on steel and aluminum and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=246.94s)]
*  We'll give you an announcement as to what the exact date is [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=253.42s)]
*  but it'll be a tremendous amount of money for our country tremendous amount these are big numbers and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=256.7s)]
*  In addition to that and and you see the power of the tariff [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=262.3s)]
*  I mean the tariff is and nobody can compete with us because we have by far the biggest piggy bank and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=265.96s)]
*  And [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=272.1s)]
*  So that'll take place very quickly, but also we'll be doing pharmaceuticals [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=273.38s)]
*  To bring our industry back. We want to bring pharmaceuticals back to the country and the way you bring it back to the country is by [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=278.46000000000004s)]
*  Putting up a wall and the wall is a tariff wall. We were the richest country in the world [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=285.06s)]
*  We were at our richest from 1870 there's my favorite [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=289.82s)]
*  tariffs my favorite word and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=294.74s)]
*  Then they went to an income tax concept and you know, how did that work out? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=297.42s)]
*  Fine. It's okay. But yeah, I [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=302.1s)]
*  Said this like barely early on but I think he's using tariffs as a way to offset [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=305.18s)]
*  Taxes like they want to cut taxes in its entirety and then use tariffs as a way to make up [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  For [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  make up for the the revenue loss, which is crazy because it's just a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=323.46000000000004s)]
*  Significantly worse a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=330.06s)]
*  Significantly worse regressive sales tax on the working poor [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=333.86s)]
*  I'll be was a very close friend of mine what happened to him was so sad one of the saddest days [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=338.1s)]
*  But they're coming in to speak to me. I look forward to it. Mr. President on the crash [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=343.66s)]
*  Do you have any concerns that your commentary about things you have described as common sense for your observations? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=348.06s)]
*  Could in any way interfere with the thorough investigation of the crash. No, I think they'll do an investigation [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=355.3s)]
*  It'll probably come out the way I said it. I like to put it up front [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=361.82000000000005s)]
*  I'm so tired of listening to things happen to our country and then people say we'll do an investigation [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=365.54s)]
*  Three years later. They come out with a report that nobody looks at [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=371.18s)]
*  Especially not in all cases. Can you do that? But in this case, you know, you had a [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=374.94000000000005s)]
*  You had a helicopter that was the black hawk was too high [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  It was above the 200 limit by double [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=382.7s)]
*  Shouldn't have been there and there were some other mistakes made too and I pointed them out also and I was right on all [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=386.38s)]
*  Of it, but they'll still do an investigation just to check it out. But I think that's yeah, they'll still do an investigation [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=391.42s)]
*  Don't worry guys [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=396.98s)]
*  I mean even though what I said is correct and there probably doesn't need to be an investigation because what I said is correct [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=397.86s)]
*  But they should they'll still do one. Don't worry guys. This was what I got it. I got it me [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=404.42s)]
*  Me the president I got it I figured it out it's black people [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=409.82s)]
*  Is black people it's the mentally is the intellectual disability [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  talented people [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=422.82s)]
*  It's the intellectually disabled [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=424.7s)]
*  You better get them in their fast because we don't have people there that are qualified and you knew that because [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=428.58s)]
*  Planes were landing very very late. They were circling all over the place [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=434.34s)]
*  We had people that didn't know what the hell they were doing and so there are [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=438.06s)]
*  Everywhere and and there are other [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=442.26s)]
*  They [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=446.42s)]
*  We have to have the best people the smartest people the sharpest people as [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=448.42s)]
*  control tower [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=453.34s)]
*  Experts and that's what they have to be they have to be experts and they have to be very smart and we didn't have our best [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=454.9s)]
*  And if you read the quote that I read yesterday at the news conference it talked about people that were [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=461.38s)]
*  Psychologically injured were okay and people that had lots of problems were okay. I'd read it again [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=466.82s)]
*  If you'd like me to but I don't think I have to waste your time [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=472.34s)]
*  I'm concerned though, sir with planes in the air all around the country people relying on that as safety. Are you? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=474.97999999999996s)]
*  Suggesting there's an ongoing risk. No, I think there's very little risk [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=480.94s)]
*  But I think that we have to make sure that this never happens again very very little risk and we're taking [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=484.58s)]
*  Actions that this can't happen again the helicopter as you know was out of its own [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=490.38s)]
*  Shouldn't have been out of its own. It was at the same height as the airplane [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=496.62s)]
*  Now the airplane was coming down on its track. It was perfect [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=500.62s)]
*  It was in perfect shape coming down and something was in its way [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=504.06s)]
*  You can't let that happen and it won't be happening again. And this was all because of weak rules in the Biden administration and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=507.06s)]
*  We're just not gonna let that kind of thing happen again and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=514.14s)]
*  Again, I could wait and I could you know, give a report in two years like they always do and sometimes it's obvious in this case [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=518.58s)]
*  Today, it was very obvious that I think I've been proven [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=525.5s)]
*  Proven to be very correct. Yeah [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=528.82s)]
*  Expect a lot of good things [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=536.7s)]
*  From all meetings. I expect good things [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=538.62s)]
*  Marco Rubio, as you know, is going to make a tour of various countries in South America [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=541.3s)]
*  He's going to be meeting in Panama where Panama's treated us very badly [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=546.7s)]
*  They gave him rather them rather foolishly a thing called the Panama Canal the most expensive project [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=551.18s)]
*  We ever built if you look at today's numbers most expensive ever built [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=558.52s)]
*  We lost 38,000 men in that case all men just about all men [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=562.58s)]
*  38,000 to the mosquito [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=568.6999999999999s)]

*  costly event [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=577.66s)]
*  We built the Panama Canal 110 years ago. Think of it the most expensive [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=579.9399999999999s)]

*  Not so good, but they've treated more importantly the Venezuelan people [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=695.26s)]
*  Very badly. We have tremendous Venezuelan population. I got 92% of the vote the Venezuelan vote [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=699.58s)]

*  But if they fired some people over there, that's a good thing because they were very bad [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=981.28s)]
*  They were very corrupt people very corrupt and they hurt our country very badly with the weaponization [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=985.52s)]
*  they used [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=991.6s)]
*  They used the justice department to go after their political opponent [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=993.36s)]
*  Which in itself is illegal? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=997.28s)]
*  And obviously it didn't work [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1000.0s)]
*  Are you going to impose tariffs on the European Union? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1002.32s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1005.68s)]
*  Well, you're asking me a question [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1012.72s)]
*  Because i'm sure you didn't hear [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1015.04s)]

*  Do you want the truthful answer or should I give you a political answer? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1021.52s)]
*  What does that mean? You're the fucking president answer normally. What is happening? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1025.52s)]
*  The european union is treated as so terrible [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1029.52s)]
*  Oh my god, you promised americans to try to reduce costs and so many of the products that would be [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1031.84s)]
*  tariffed when they come into the country the outgoing country is not paying the tariff the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1037.4399999999998s)]
*  buyers in the united states pay that and then [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1043.12s)]
*  That's passed on to consumers in most instances sometimes [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1046.8799999999999s)]
*  How would you expect to have prices come down if you have such a broad plan for tariffs? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1050.32s)]
*  And what do you say to the voters who want to see you reduce everyday costs? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1056.48s)]
*  Well, let me just tell you that I got elected for a lot of reasons. Number one was the border number two was inflation [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1060.24s)]
*  Because I had almost no inflation [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1065.6s)]
*  And yet I charged hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs to countries [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1068.0s)]
*  And think of it. I had almost no inflation and took in [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1072.8s)]
*  600 billion dollars of money from [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1078.38s)]
*  and [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1082.16s)]
*  Tariffs don't cause inflation. They cause success [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1083.76s)]
*  Cause big success. So we're gonna have great success [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1087.1200000000001s)]
*  There could be some temporary short-term disruption and people will understand that I had that one [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1089.8400000000001s)]
*  I negotiated some of the good deals for the farmers and unfortunately those deals have been [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1094.88s)]
*  Let us stray by biden and his people because they didn't enforce the deals [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1100.72s)]
*  We have a deal with china, which is phenomenal for the farmers, but there was nobody to enforce it in the biden administration [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1104.72s)]
*  They let them get away with murder. So that's another thing we're going to be bringing [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1110.72s)]
*  They committed to buying 50 billion dollars worth of farm product and they did it [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1116.56s)]
*  When I was president as soon as I left they stopped doing it because there was nobody in biden to [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1120.64s)]
*  enforce it [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1125.52s)]
*  But the tariffs are going to make us very rich [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1126.64s)]
*  And very strong and we're going to treat other countries very fairly [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1129.3600000000001s)]
*  But if you think about it other countries charge us tariffs, we don't charge them tariffs [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1134.64s)]
*  And it's about time that that changes sir. Are you concerned about the market reaction around tariffs? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1140.96s)]
*  No, I know tariffs the word tariff is a very misunderstood word word. I've you've heard me say I say it kiddingly but [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1146.4s)]
*  It's one of the most beautiful words [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPznyJ7M2tI&t=1155.2s)]
