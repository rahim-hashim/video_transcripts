# Only Resistance Ever Made Israel Back Off | HasanAbi Archive ft Eric Hovagim And Noah
**HasanAbi:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE)
*  It's all Israel's way. What do we think about the Tony Blair Institute coming in? Oh the Gaza thing? Yeah [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=0.0s)]
*  What did they do? I didn't see that. So there's an FT story. Just Google FT Tony Blair Institute [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=7.04s)]
*  Which by the way Tony Blair Institute the acronym that they use for it is TBI [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=13.68s)]
*  like I [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=19.64s)]
*  Tony Blair staff took part in Gaza Riviera project with Boston Consulting Group [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=21.56s)]
*  It's cocktail wait update wake up the latest trip to Doha ceasefire talk still not right shocker [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=30.32s)]
*  way, I can't believe when when Benjamin and Yahoo came to get his laundry done and have Donald Trump still like [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=36.04s)]
*  Jenny fleck to him. I will confess I got triggered in the car yesterday [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=42.28s)]
*  My dad and I were driving and the radio came on it was like a BBC update about [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=45.56s)]
*  Like the state of the negotiations and it got to like Hamas has agreed to terms for a ceasefire that involve a major concession [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=49.92s)]
*  The concession is that the ceasefire does not necessarily mean an end to the conflict and I was like well [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  Then it sounds like the ceasefire negotiations are not going well at all [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  And that like what Hamas has agreed to is not what it like it sounds like is that's not a ceasefire [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=66.92s)]
*  Like it just sounds like every other time we get this far in the process [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Which is that like Lucy yanks the football because it turns out that it's like a ceasefire [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=74.64s)]
*  Except the fire doesn't cease. It's so goofy [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=79.16s)]
*  Yeah, I I don't [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=82.92s)]
*  Don't even know what they're trying to get out of this at this point [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  I guess like I guess like their goal is to basically go through the process of attrition and to create so much [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=88.12s)]
*  instability and so much anger and resentment that people are just like dude just just [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=94.04s)]
*  It's fine if Israel is like, you know ten days later [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=97.68s)]
*  But like give us ten days of peace or sixty days of peace. I think eventually that's like that is what seemingly they're gonna [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  They're gonna push for [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  Jeremy's Gahel Hamas disputes us and is really claims about ceasefire progress [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  Us and Israel claimed Gaza ceasefire talks are yielding results. This was all [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=114.28s)]
*  Predictable from anybody who'd been reading the headlines of the past week. They were clearly putting lipstick on it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=117.64s)]
*  I haven't even I haven't even like paying them. There's no reason to have been I actively told people who like asked me about it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=122.28s)]
*  I was like don't disregard. Yeah, I mean it's the main reason being that like there is yet to be a successful [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=128.0s)]
*  Ceasefire implementation in a meaningful way and the second is that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=134.88s)]
*  There's like a lot of incentives for Western press and Western leaders to publicly [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=139.28s)]
*  Claim that we're close to something when we're not at all. Yeah, because the pressure valve is built at this point. Yep [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=144.88s)]
*  And they get to point to say it's weird [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=152.2s)]
*  It's weird is like also on the other hand like they are also accelerating the censorship regime and like places like the UK [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=154.2s)]
*  Palestine action getting prescribed as a organization [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  So they're trying to burn the candle on both ends like on the one hand [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=163.72s)]
*  They're trying to release this pressure valve by being like oh, but we're trying something and maybe Hamas will get on board with it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=166.48s)]
*  This time or whatever while trying to like mystify the process even though it's the exact same thing that they've done over and over again [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=171.88s)]
*  They're hoping that people are not knowledgeable enough and not paying attention [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  Which is the Anthony Blinken Joe Biden route? Yeah, that's exactly what they did every single time or for the old heads [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=181.12s)]
*  It is the Bill Clinton route unironically this was like he was the OG with the so-called peace process where they would [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=188.12s)]
*  I feel like they they would come to to come to the table make like the Israelis would make like ridiculous [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  demands and Arafat would have like [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=203.04s)]
*  incredibly normal like bare minimum of functioning society needs and then [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=206.2s)]
*  It when it when it went nowhere Israelis would say oh Arafat had like crazy ideas and then Bill Clinton would also say yeah [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=213.48s)]
*  It was actually [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=220.0s)]
*  Arafat that up [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  Because there's I mean it it ends up being I think the way that I would put it is that like there's no [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=223.04s)]
*  I mean I go back to like Lucy in the football like Arafat bit in the 90s with Oslo that like at a moment [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=230.0s)]
*  When he had something resembling leverage and like I think that like White House pressure could have been applied [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=237.16s)]
*  You know not saying that there's like some like major path not taken there [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=241.92s)]
*  I don't want to I don't want to claim that but it does seem pretty clear that like it was a there was something more interesting [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=245.12s)]
*  Going on at that moment and instead we got the Oslo process [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=250.04s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that now it's like this many years past it like I think you just have to be pretty deluded [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=252.88s)]
*  to not look at like this the last 35 years and see a consistent and straight line which is again like a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=259.2s)]
*  Process by which like Palestinians if they make any concession in any direction [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=266.24s)]
*  It's like only you know it's held up as a process by which like actually drove [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=270.36s)]
*  You know like like they like like they held out and they you know refused to go further and they refused to seal the deal [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=275.8s)]
*  or anything like this and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  all that's end up you know like the consequence of it is the Palestinians and made a concession and it wasn't framed as such and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  So it just keeps spiraling downward and downward until we got to eventually a situation where you know in October 7th happens a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=289.24s)]
*  moment of massive like security paradigm shattering resistance takes place against Israel and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=296.2s)]
*  Now they're forced you know because they were just it was a matter of like kicking the can down the road and now now [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  They've they've gotten to that point, and it's just that was the answer in the always in the end obviously [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  Because we're not living through this process [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  It's impossible to understand truly how like the regular civilian public feels [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  About experiencing a genocide beyond like the people that I've interviewed that have survived this but [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=324.76000000000005s)]
*  How can anyone look at the back-and-forth that took place with Iran a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=330.5s)]
*  nation state that has sovereignty a nation state that has a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=335.09999999999997s)]
*  missile striking capability of like the capability of punishing Israel and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=339.85999999999996s)]
*  See how that it unfolded [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=344.29999999999995s)]
*  the back-and-forth there and how Israel was [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=347.73999999999995s)]
*  Absolutely forced to concede after 12 days [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=352.41999999999996s)]
*  How can anyone look at that and still think like oh you can't do militant resistance against this ruthless force [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=355.08s)]
*  They do not respond to the Yemeni, but I was going to say the Yemenis are still fighting. Yeah, it's not [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=360.76s)]
*  To that point like the Iran stuff [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  I think is like it would behoove people in general to just kind of watch as that stuff unfolds because I think that it still [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=370.4s)]
*  feels like [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=376.76s)]
*  It's done exactly [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=378.35999999999996s)]
*  Over it's so like it's so fluid and on top of which like it's you know [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  Did I do believe that there is even though like Iran like didn't exactly you know, like deal a bunch of like [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  Crazy meaningful blows to Israel the idea that there is now some like position though of like invulnerability that Israel occupies [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=392.36s)]
*  It's been like proven like not like if Iran wanted to get empty of emptied [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=399.92s)]
*  It's like Israel's batteries of air defense could have been meaningfully tested not just Israel's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=404.04s)]
*  American Patriot defense [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=409.52s)]
*  American Patriot missiles and like the the THAAD launchers failed there were times when like THAAD launchers that that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=411.52s)]
*  interceptors actually deployed in current Israeli targets there were [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  There is only a finite amount of I'm not a missile autist by any means but this is something that I [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  These were news that there were major articles in the Wall Street Journal [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=430.08s)]
*  Especially the Wall Street Journal was where the biggest one was that was talking about how these supplies were running thin [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=432.88s)]
*  I mean, there's there's no [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=437.8s)]
*  Israel cannot take a like like Israel [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=439.48s)]
*  It's interesting because like the deterrence capacity that Israel has is what allows for it like my friend Dylan Saba [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=442.28s)]
*  Who's he's made this point? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=449.56s)]
*  He wrote a great article for Jewish current years at Jewish currents years ago that makes this point about like Iron Dome is an offensive weapon [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=451.2s)]
*  How is that because the like deterrence the the like sphere of deterrence that Iron Dome creates is the space in which? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  Israel can like do its bloodlust [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=464.28s)]
*  Yeah, and so Israel can only get away with [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=466.28s)]
*  Punishing its neighbors as long as his neighbors can't actually bring back that violence to the Israeli public correct [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=469.76s)]
*  They have to maintain a country where they are they have like laptop jobs a country where you can eat truck it drink your matcha [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=475.35999999999996s)]
*  Latte or whatever and and LARP as though you're like this [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=482.35999999999996s)]
*  Western aligned Western nation in the middle of this like barbaric neighborhood, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=486.2s)]
*  And you can't do that when all of a sudden you're experiencing albeit a fraction of the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=491.04s)]
*  violence that you have dished out in the in the region not even a fraction it's like a [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=497.08000000000004s)]
*  minor percentage of that but all of a sudden that breaks through the the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=501.24s)]
*  the security veil that you have created for yourself and now it feels like the entire public is a [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=506.32000000000005s)]
*  experiencing what it truly is to be in war and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=513.08s)]
*  therefore [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  The militant resistance that has been born in the region as a direct consequence of like Israeli incursions Israeli is [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=518.12s)]
*  Has shown itself to be the only proven method of forcing Israel to stand down time and time again [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=526.2s)]
*  And it's also like Israel's doing like itself no favors in the next generations of this stuff [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=532.68s)]
*  You know, for example, like Egypt, right is like a society being kept in check by a very, you know [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=537.52s)]
*  By a military dictatorship underwritten by the West or whatever and like that's not a country that is like in a particular [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=542.3s)]
*  Great place and you know economically in terms of development [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=547.6s)]
*  Like it has to get bailed out by Gulf states in the IMF or whomever [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=551.2s)]
*  Yeah, they get I think they get more economic aid overall than even Israel does yearly not like the last two years [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  No, but it's it's you're right [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=561.2s)]

*  Generations that were raised on just like experiencing these like successive humiliations with no meaningful promise of improvement for their own lives [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=567.44s)]
*  Like it's or or at least like for their society. I mean and you know, like Israel's not the only stressor being put on these countries [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=574.6s)]
*  I mean like Egypt's worried about the dam that they just built in Ethiopia for example [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=582.36s)]
*  like there's a like there's a world in which it's also like Israel's undone because like the complexity of the regions that it's in can't [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=586.0400000000001s)]

*  You know put pressure on Israel in ways that Israel's resisted until now because America has always been there to say no off Egypt [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=597.2800000000001s)]
*  No off Syria. No off whomever like you have no rights here. It's all Israel's way [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=603.28s)]
*  What do we think about the Tony Blair Institute? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=607.72s)]
*  Coming in the Gaza thing. Yeah [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=610.8s)]
*  What do they do? I didn't see that. So there's an FT story certain just Google FT Tony Blair Institute [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=613.36s)]
*  Which which by the way, Tony Blair Institute the acronym that they use for it is TV. I like I [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=619.9599999999999s)]
*  Tony Blair staff took part in Gaza Riviera project with Boston Consulting Group [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they so but the thing is that you that's worth like in this article like the headline kind of tells a little story [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=631.98s)]
*  but they [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=637.5s)]
*  The thing you got to get though in the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=640.22s)]
*  Statement the the journalists had proof they had proof [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=644.58s)]
*  You type in archive diet, yes [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=652.02s)]
*  Alright so [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=658.62s)]
*  The plan so as they put together [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=661.22s)]
*  Okay [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=664.02s)]
*  the plan outlined in the slide they seen by FT was led by Israeli businessman and used financial models developed inside Boston Consulting Group to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=664.54s)]
*  reimagined Gaza is a [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=672.18s)]
*  thriving trading hub [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=673.7s)]
*  Okay [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=675.7s)]
*  So while the Tony Blair Institute did not author or endorse the final slide deck [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=676.54s)]
*  Two staff members at the former UK Prime Minister's Institute participated in message groups and calls as the project developed [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=680.78s)]
*  One lengthy document on post-war Gaza written by a TBI staff member was shared within the group for consideration [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=687.9s)]
*  This included the idea of a Gaza Riviera with artificial islands off the coast akin to those in Dubai [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=693.98s)]
*  blockchain based [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=700.86s)]
*  Deepwater port to tie Gaza into the India Middle East Europe economic corridors and get ready low-tax [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=703.26s)]
*  Special economic zones dude now everything [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=709.9s)]
*  Everyone to be this is the important part [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=713.3399999999999s)]
*  This is the important part when first approached by the FT regarding its role in the project a TBI [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=716.4599999999999s)]
*  Spokesperson said your story is categorically wrong TBI was not involved in the preparation of the deck [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=722.74s)]
*  Which was a BCG deck BCG is a consulting group the consultancy and had no input [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=728.38s)]
*  What's so they also wash their hands of this now, right? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=733.3399999999999s)]
*  Like what is context the FT then provided details of a 12 person message group used for the project including to be to TBI staff [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=735.38s)]
*  BCG consultants and the Israeli businessmen and an unpublished TBI document shared within the group at this point the TBI [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=744.3000000000001s)]
*  spokesperson said we have never said TBI knew nothing about what this group was working on or [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=751.46s)]
*  That they weren't on calls in which the group discussed their plans [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=756.94s)]
*  TBI said that when meeting groups to discuss post-war plans [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=760.98s)]
*  It is essentially in listening mode the internal TBI document looked at proposals being made by various parties [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=764.46s)]
*  It was one of many such internal documents like we saw the the constitution camp Holocaust like Auschwitz revamp as well [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=771.58s)]
*  It would be wrong to suggest that we were working with this group to produce their Gaza plan [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=778.94s)]
*  all right [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=783.94s)]
*  this is I love the Financial Times reporting in the story because [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=784.18s)]
*  There's a lot of times when a newspaper will give like somebody [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=787.58s)]
*  Like five paragraphs of a response and like a PR reply and it's just it's it's pablum. It's stupid and it's a waste of everybody's time [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=791.3000000000001s)]
*  This is the time when the PR response is so insane and stupid and that they have to like cover up for lying [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=798.0600000000001s)]
*  At first blush to journalists that it's like you this is like the noose being dripped out. It's amazing [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=805.62s)]
*  Yeah, TBI said Blair saw a better Gaza for Gazans for the past two decades. Oh my god [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=811.74s)]
*  I hate these animals so much. Yeah, let's turn everything into like little Miami's dude cryptocurrency pedophilia [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=816.1s)]
*  Do it all slavery the real everything bagel. Yeah, the UAE is looking at that fantasizing [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=822.58s)]
*  They're like they're delighted their mouth is watering. I think BB used to work for BCG, right? Yeah, he did. Yes. Yeah [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=828.9s)]
*  Where hasn't that work bro BCG CIA? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=836.82s)]
*  I mean Billy boy where where he's he's a husband everything he's an MIT. He did it all [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=840.5s)]
*  Have you heard about the stories of Cyprus Israelis taking over? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=846.9s)]
*  I mean, I know Israelis historically like they have ties to Cyprus because like for example [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=850.86s)]
*  If you're an Israeli and you don't want to get married [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=856.34s)]
*  Yeah, you have to go to Cyprus to get gay married. Well in general or interfaith or just civil because the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=858.34s)]
*  Like it's all religious it's religious courts that control the institution of marriage in Israel [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=864.22s)]
*  So like if you just don't even if you're Jewish and you just don't want to get like some [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=868.94s)]
*  So you don't want to have like a rabbi have to bless your marriage. Yeah, Cyprus [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=873.26s)]
*  So they're like it's like just to give an example of like how interwoven they are already in a lot of ways with the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=877.34s)]
*  Yeah, with the island, but now they're just like people are scared [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=882.14s)]
*  apparently that they're taking over more and more swaths of land in Cyprus or something and [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=885.5s)]
*  I don't know if it's like just basically people doing tourism and being annoying as Israeli tourists are known to be [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=889.98s)]
*  Or if it's like legitimately like becoming people are off. People are doing the like they want to be in both places [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=895.82s)]
*  I don't think people can outwardly I don't think Israeli society and like the structure permit large numbers of people publicly saying peace out bye [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=902.0600000000001s)]
*  However [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=909.66s)]
*  Anecdotally, I can tell you I know a lot of people who are in Israel who may have made sure that they have two passports [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=910.94s)]
*  That they have a home in another country, you know, like and by the way, not just like Jewish Israelis [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=916.54s)]
*  I'm talking about like often, you know [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=920.38s)]
*  Palestinians from Nazareth places within you know [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=922.38s)]
*  Like the 48 borders who have his people of Israeli citizenship and who like have essentially written off the idea of a future in the country [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=924.94s)]
*  And there are people who are in you know, people who are professional class middle class invested in Israeli [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=931.98s)]
*  If you're an academic if you're an academic and you're not like Benny Morris or something and even Benny Morris [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=936.94s)]
*  Like like what life do you what future do you envision? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=942.2199999999999s)]
*  That you will have in a place like Israel with everything that's going on if you're like even remotely aware [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=945.26s)]
*  I'm not saying you have to feel bad about the child murder the child holocaust that is happening 50 miles down the beaches of Tel Aviv [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=951.26s)]
*  but like [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=959.02s)]
*  Even if you're aware of like the instability in the country, like you would probably have the capacity to leave [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=961.02s)]
*  You're gonna leave I think that they they also there's a [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=967.9s)]
*  Part of this is that like at the same time, right? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=971.0999999999999s)]
*  Like we're describing a subset of people who do want to leave because the Israel as it is becoming is not just like [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=973.9799999999999s)]
*  Out of whack with values or whatever of these subjects but also like it's economically unviable and so on [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=980.06s)]
*  Yeah, the people who are ascendant in Israel right now like the coalition coming to power that is like [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=984.9399999999999s)]
*  Driving a lot of like the most intense genocidal lust for the people who are in Israel right now [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=989.42s)]
*  That is like driving a lot of like the most intense genocidal lust right are people who actually are kind of winners in this new paradigm [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=994.22s)]
*  Within Israel even if it's like we view it as like winning as like they've got they get to rule over the the shrinking ice flow [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1001.02s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1007.1s)]
*  And in this case, it's obviously it's the ultra-orthodox of the religious who have gradually consolidated over control over a variety of institutions [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1007.66s)]
*  But that that is that is moving the country away from like the the western style country that it wanted to be [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1013.8199999999999s)]
*  And that's how you lose a lot of the the western pr [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1020.78s)]
*  Like if israel if all the arab jews that lived in israel [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1024.46s)]
*  Slowly but surely over the course of the past couple of decades became like less arab [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1028.38s)]
*  And therefore couldn't do as much like infiltration and operations as they initially were able to do successfully [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1031.9s)]
*  The same goes for like western pr if you don't have like the old school ashkenazi [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1038.14s)]
*  connection to like the western countries and whatnot and you become more and more like [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1043.66s)]
*  uh, illiterate hareddys with a nuclear arsenal [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1048.94s)]
*  then [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1052.94s)]
*  None of the people that want to be in intelligentsia is going to want to remain there because they're gonna be like this is gross [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1054.14s)]
*  Like they're spitting on me because i'm gay now there's you're you're absolutely right [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1058.78s)]
*  But the thing that like the thing I would [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1062.3s)]
*  Emphasize is that people view this as like something that has like a tipping point effect that there's going to be a moment [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1064.44s)]
*  And this may be true in the sense that like there is such a tipping point in the future [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1069.26s)]
*  um where there's like a critical such a critical mass of these kinds of people have left that like the state as like [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1073.26s)]
*  As you know like a as as an entity able to [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1079.74s)]
*  Effectuate its own interests or whatever like it has lost that power that it does not have like that that elite that was essential to doing that [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1083.08s)]
*  I actually don't believe that like that kind like I believe that that kind of scenario is a bit of a fantasy most generally [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1089.6599999999999s)]
*  Like I think in south africa for example, right? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1097.1s)]
*  Like apartheid south africa's government ended because the people in charge more or less decided to throw in the towel [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1099.6599999999999s)]
*  And they did so in a way that was able to preserve an enormous amount of power [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1105.26s)]
*  Even as the apartheid system was dismantled and black south africans were given meaningful rights and so on [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1108.94s)]
*  I think in this situation though, like like these [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1114.7s)]
*  I don't think that this particular like group of people whomever like [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1117.9s)]
*  Even if like like this thing will go down rather violently and even if these kinds of critical mass of people leave like [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1122.3s)]
*  the state will like [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1128.46s)]
*  Continue to exist and it will just be a way more bloody and even more primitive and even more violent version of the thing that it [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1130.3s)]
*  Is now whether that can a lot, you know, like surgically conjoined at the hip to american strategic interest [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1135.5s)]
*  I kind of doubt [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1141.98s)]
*  Even you know, even though it has been like past, you know what is defined the last half century. It won't it it won't be able to [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1143.58s)]
*  it will turn into a pure vassal or or maybe even like a [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1150.78s)]
*  Like a more advanced version I guess of like how america treats its regional actors regional allies like the kurdish militias and [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1155.3400000000001s)]

*  Like it because it can't maintain [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1167.82s)]
*  the the very successful influence operation that has had a stranglehold on like american institutions if [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1170.94s)]
*  uh, if you don't have that intelligentsia if you don't have the academics if you don't have like the [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1179.42s)]
*  The the constant commerce like you don't have people who can you don't have people who can go on american media networks and not sound [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1184.46s)]
*  Satanic. Yeah and not sound like you're you are literally just justifying child murder. Yeah, like that's that's like a like and that was like [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1191.56s)]
*  You know the house, who's gonna do that eat him or bang your ear like that? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1199.02s)]
*  There's you're you know people watching this can look up. There's a figure named abba ebben [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1202.54s)]
*  a bba eban who was like considered the most erudite sort of like like the exact kind of person whom israel lacks now and if [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1206.14s)]
*  You are a liberal zionist you are like like the kind of person, you know [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1214.06s)]
*  And who still loves israel in you know, in spite of like the the atrocities it's committing like that kind of person is like wishing [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1217.4199999999998s)]
*  Nostalgically for something like abba ebben to be around somebody who you know coins, you know bonn motz [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1224.04s)]
*  Like the palestinians have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity and so on like there's a kind of [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1228.22s)]
*  Like a person that they imagine that like well if they just had this now [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1234.7s)]
*  It would be helpful and it's like that would be true if you had like thousands of them and that like you hadn't just like [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1238.46s)]
*  Completely made like being a supportive of israel something that is like the province of like, you know [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1244.22s)]
*  Again, like people who love child murder exclusively and who can't be convinced by like npr effective Israeli spokesman anymore [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1248.94s)]
*  Like that era is gone. Yeah, and on the other side [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1255.98s)]
*  Uh, there is a I think I mean you could speak to this better than me [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1260.0600000000002s)]
*  I think but I feel like there is a there's a severance, uh in the younger generation of jews that israel relies on to also [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1264.22s)]
*  Keep up the the propaganda initiative like you get into like young zionists [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1273.02s)]
*  are are [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1278.6200000000001s)]
*  primarily, uh going to turn into like a rabid base of evangelical christians in the country as opposed to like having [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1279.96s)]
*  uh, like brilliant academic jews that have like uh, secular loyalty to israel because it's like zionism has become like a secular religion [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1287.1000000000001s)]
*  uh for all of the uh, all the jews that don't like really care about keeping kosher but like [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1294.6200000000001s)]
*  Want a sense of community and a sense of shared purpose that's gone for the most part [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1299.58s)]
*  And the only jewish people that will maintain that will be like dudes who are not going to college who are you know? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1304.1399999999999s)]
*  Already super conservative and maybe there's a catch though [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1309.9s)]
*  There's a catch though [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1312.22s)]
*  Which is that like we're talking about people and like power and like the power establishment is composed not just of people but also money [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1313.02s)]
*  And like the major institutions of the american jewish life like parts of the major american jewish establishment [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1319.5s)]
*  And are you know organizations like the american jewish committee the federations [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1325.68s)]
*  Organizations that help that do everything from like, uh, you know some welfare provision [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1329.8400000000001s)]
*  But to a lot of you know supporting existing synagogues and so on but are also instrumental in like, you know [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1334.16s)]
*  Not being aggressively nakedly like like like we don't think of them as like apac even though they are also part of the israel lobby [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1339.44s)]
*  like all the [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1347.28s)]
*  And some are more hardcore all the guys that yelled at uh, john ossoff [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1348.56s)]
*  Yeah, like that list of people which was like jewish children's foundation [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1352.56s)]
*  and so there's gonna be I think like [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1356.96s)]
*  Those organizations like they're they're moneyed. They are financed and you will always you know, like the money will always like [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1360.0s)]
*  Honey attracts flies, you know, like it will always end up being able to uh, or I guess honey attracts bees [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1366.0s)]
*  But shit attracts flies [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1372.48s)]
*  um the like they will always be able to [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1374.08s)]
*  Like maintain and be you know punch their weight or whatever [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1378.0s)]
*  I think what's gonna happen and like this is what my anxiety is that like the association of and like the increasing like [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1380.48s)]
*  Narrowness of like oh like there's no daylight between what israel does and like what these these organizations advocate [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1387.5s)]
*  Will lead us to a place where it's like yeah [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1393.3600000000001s)]
*  like the people who publicly identify as jews and jewish life and who breaks through in elite political life will just be jonathan greenblatt and [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1395.28s)]
*  Everybody else's perspective won't count and the largest base of foot soldiers for all this shit are going to be as you pointed out [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1402.06s)]
*  Like christian zionist christian zionist and you know [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1408.48s)]
*  Yay [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1412.88s)]
*  great [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1414.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that also I mean, I don't know [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1415.68s)]
*  I I don't think I always joke philip says this too, but like americans are not well read enough to be like euro style anti-semites [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1419.2800000000002s)]
*  Because there's too much reading involved with that level [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1427.92s)]
*  I don't know [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1431.2s)]
*  I think that like a lot of what i'm learning about the the quote unquote noticing that's going on on social media [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1431.76s)]
*  about the jews is like this like I like this really [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1437.6s)]
*  kind of uh [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1441.9199999999998s)]
*  like it's it actually kind of dovetails with like the like the like the like the the most stupid people's uh, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1443.84s)]
*  conspiracy politics of the present which is just like oh have you noticed so and such as jewish and so is so and such and like [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1449.8999999999999s)]
*  These people are already like kind of running at like the limits of reason and so it does feel to me that like [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1456.1599999999999s)]
*  Base anti-semitism even if I don't think it'll end up being like a crazy material threat to jewish people in america [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1462.1599999999999s)]
*  And like a systematic or grand scale like there is just going to be like it's hard to deny that like oh, yeah [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1468.08s)]
*  We're gonna have a rise in it based on like how people are socialized now to just like be like, oh, yeah [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1473.6799999999998s)]
*  This person knows this person therefore. They're in an evil conjoined association. And by the way, they're jewish and like that [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1478.6399999999999s)]
*  That'll just continue and that combined with the fact that like the institutions in public life that do identify as jewish [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1484.9599999999998s)]
*  And claim to make the rules about what's anti-semitic and what's not are like largely doing so just because of israel [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1491.36s)]
*  It's like a perfect storm to like make people to like [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1496.32s)]
*  manufacture anti-semitism [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1500.3s)]
*  Have you guys talked with like your normie friends about? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1502.16s)]
*  What they think about anti-semitism right now because at least in my own experience [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1505.52s)]
*  I feel like in talking with folks who aren't perpetually online or aren't you know, particularly well read just normal working-class folks [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1509.04s)]
*  it seems like the average person has developed a [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1516.56s)]
*  considerable amount of some resentment towards and I think that's [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1521.1s)]
*  Kind of terrifying because you always have to kind of talk them down and be like, well actually, you know, chill out, please [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1525.76s)]
*  you know, just be normal and [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1530.64s)]
*  I don't know. I mean even this past weekend. I was talking with friends and [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1532.72s)]
*  They have historically been extremely, you know, like fine not racist [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1537.04s)]
*  But they were starting to express like oh, you know [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1543.1200000000001s)]
*  I could understand why someone would feel that way sort of thing [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1545.44s)]
*  I will say it's hard for me to have those conversations because i'm like [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1548.16s)]
*  I radiate juke like i'm just like really jewish and like outward like it's I don't like it's just hard for me [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1552.16s)]
*  He has it with me. I'm the guy [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1558.48s)]
*  Well, it's like it's like hard for me to have a convert to like get to that [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1559.92s)]
*  It's hard for me to get to a convert to a conversation where we're talking about jewish people like that [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1563.2s)]
*  And like it hasn't come up yet that i'm jewish [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1567.92s)]
*  So i'll have to like take your perspective on it on that friend [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1570.4s)]
*  I mean like it's I because I just don't think that like also the way people understand racism is that even [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1573.68s)]
*  Like even a guy in a clan robe in 2025 would like try to find a way to explain that he's not racist [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1580.16s)]
*  Like it's it's just the weird like tick of this like so I could never be the person to be like [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=1587.04s)]

*  Uh made by the visegrad guy [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2658.3599999999997s)]
*  Very common. Okay pro israel influencer visegrad 24 in an interview with adl co jonathan greenblatt inside adl's headquarters ask greenblatt if the adl [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2661.3199999999997s)]

*  Greenblatt won't even give him a crumb [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2671.24s)]
*  Accusations against the adl is that it does [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2674.9s)]
*  focus on on [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2678.2799999999997s)]
*  Groups that claim to represent the interests of white people [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2679.88s)]
*  Uh-huh. Do you do you think there's any truth to that that you do perhaps focus more on? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2683.88s)]
*  White people more than anyone else. The reason I ask this question is I think israel has done [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2689.7999999999997s)]
*  And and by extension the jewish people have done several things right and that is they have managed to preserve themselves [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2696.2s)]
*  as [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2702.68s)]
*  as a as a group of people [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2703.48s)]
*  Without a state they've managed to successfully do that for a very long time [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2706.12s)]
*  It's a wonderful saying that goes for as long as the jews have kept the shabbat the shabbat has kept the jews [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2710.2s)]
*  They've managed to retain a respect for their traditions and values [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2715.64s)]
*  He's literally earnestly saying israel is awesome at being an ethno state [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2719.7999999999997s)]
*  and it is maintained like [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2726.04s)]
*  a jewish ethno state perfectly [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2728.12s)]
*  And why can't white people like he's going to turn around and be like why can't white people do that? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2730.44s)]
*  Even the unreligious jews have a broad respect for they've managed to have especially in israel israel is the only [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2734.12s)]
*  Only western country with an above a replacement level demographic rate. They've been very good at having strong borders [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2741.7200000000003s)]
*  They've stuck together [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2748.6s)]
*  Right and the fact of sticking together the reason that they managed to survive without a state for so long is because they have stuck together [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2749.88s)]
*  If for example, there is a group of white americans who wants to put the interests of white americans first and says, okay [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2756.6s)]
*  We are a group that is currently [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2762.8399999999997s)]
*  Smaller and smaller as a percentage of the entire united states and and and the demographics shifting [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2765.56s)]
*  Is that something that is? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2771.24s)]
*  problematic [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2773.46s)]
*  Um, it's an interesting question. I mean, I think look the fact of the matter is I have no [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2775.16s)]
*  Dude, dude, no, it's so funny. He [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2780.52s)]
*  he is [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2784.52s)]
*  He literally is like [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2786.04s)]
*  Trying to come to terms with like being open to white nationalism [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2788.92s)]
*  Because it's identical to what israel is doing it's the richard spencer dynamic as I was saying earlier like [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2794.12s)]
*  Richard spencer likes israel because he wants to do what israel is able to do for jewish people [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2800.44s)]
*  but for white people here in america for white christians [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2805.56s)]
*  and [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2809.24s)]
*  And there's a there's a honesty there from the visegrad account because he's not like attacking jonathan greenblatt [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2810.68s)]
*  he's simply saying like [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2816.92s)]
*  don't you think like we can have our own thing, which is funny because he's polish but [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2818.6s)]
*  I mean it is and he would not be considered a part of the white it is [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2823.24s)]
*  There was I forget if it was spencer himself [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2826.52s)]
*  but I remember like years ago, there was an encounter at texas a&m where like richard spencer and like a like a [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2828.92s)]
*  Like somebody was doing like an on-campus event. I think it was spencer and it was like a campus rabbi or somebody got up [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2835.72s)]
*  Like a rabbi and was like pointing this out like, you know, you sir anti-semitic [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2841.08s)]
*  And the guy and spencer like told him straight up like I love jews [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=2845.56s)]

*  And don't encroach on my ability to lead a full, you know life [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3006.46s)]
*  Based on again my values and beliefs [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3010.94s)]
*  So I think typically the organizations [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3013.58s)]
*  Uh who espouse a kind of white nationalism [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3016.86s)]
*  Tend to have a view that's quite let's just say negative toward non-white people [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3020.7000000000003s)]

*  Let me bounce back on that [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3049.02s)]
*  I don't think the jews have a negative attitude towards non-jews even though they put their own interests first [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3050.3s)]
*  I do you see that it doesn't it's not necessarily exclusionary, right? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3057.42s)]
*  You can put the interest of the group first and say the reason i'm doing this i'm i'm half polish [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3061.1800000000003s)]

*  I'm a proponent of strong borders [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3070.7000000000003s)]
*  For a variety of reasons and one of those reasons is is I I don't necessarily want to see the demographic fabric [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3073.3399999999997s)]
*  I would like the people to come to be people who respect I hate this shit because it's just tautological [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3079.4199999999996s)]
*  It's like I don't want to see I just I just like the demographic [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3084.3799999999997s)]
*  I just like the fact that the few white people in the country because I don't want to see demographics change [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3087.66s)]
*  Okay, why don't you want to see and it's like yeah, you can never like you just don't want to what's the bad thing? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3092.46s)]

*  How do they change the culture in a bad way? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3101.42s)]
*  Oh, it turns out that like actually like they almost always profess and live out the like same traditional values that we espouse [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3103.9s)]
*  except in like far more honest ways of integrity than like yeah we do is like while also simultaneously like improving the [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3109.1s)]
*  The cuisine and doing all of the jobs that we refuse to do while we exploit them for it [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3115.34s)]
*  It's just but it's funny to be a polish guy like half polish half english [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3119.74s)]
*  And and not realize that like they think you are that in england brother [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3123.42s)]
*  Like they let it you could wear the ascot all day, but like a big part of brexit [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3130.3799999999997s)]
*  Revolved around these polish migration. I will say is get these jokes in right now [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3135.8199999999997s)]
*  Because like poland is going to be richer than the uk in like five to ten years [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3141.1s)]
*  No, no, i'm not even i'm not i'm not doing the anti-polish stuff because like polish subreddit gets no but it's yeah [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3144.7s)]

*  Yeah, like a big part of brexit happened because they were very mad [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3160.78s)]
*  That lower wage polish workers were coming in to take jobs [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3165.98s)]
*  At a at a lower rate than like the natural born british workers were taking they were not taking those jobs at all this is real [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3170.7000000000003s)]
*  It's the same shit. It's the same shit with like, you know, all mexicans are coming in and taking our jobs. It's like [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3178.38s)]
*  Um, so they are the mexicans of of western europe, so I don't know what the team he thinks he's on here [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3183.66s)]

*  I don't think that mass migration will necessarily help retain those things [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3195.98s)]
*  Do you see I don't know if that's a white policy. No, that's just uh, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3200.54s)]

*  That use that agenda to you know [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3405.34s)]
*  Degrade and and undermine [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3409.02s)]
*  Uh black people like there's it's there's a real history there. So like when you talk about something like strong borders [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3412.1400000000003s)]
*  Look, I think we all want strong [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3419.9s)]
*  Well, maybe I shouldn't say that I think it is totally defensive. Wait, wait, wait bro. Bro thought he was in israel for a second [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3422.3s)]
*  I realized we all want strong but I meant no, we don't want strong borders [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3429.34s)]
*  Just israel has strong borders and I like that strong borders to keep out the people who are from israel. Yeah, israel was israel god. Yeah [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3433.82s)]
*  It's just i'm kind of with him. I feel like he has some good points [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3443.1000000000004s)]
*  It's simple civil civil rights hero. Jonathan greenblatt a reasonable position. That's him to want uh, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3447.5s)]
*  strong borders and immigration policy [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3453.9s)]
*  That number one allows the government to have some degree of you know, effective control over who's coming into their country [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3456.86s)]
*  Number two make sure that as people come into the country [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3463.58s)]
*  They are obeying the laws and that they are assimilating into the country to a degree [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3466.54s)]
*  Why do you like what are you saying? You're like you're a civil rights guy [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3473.02s)]
*  What do you mean you you run a civil rights organization? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3477.26s)]
*  But they're now they are like the adl is in the middle of like a pretty big pivot away from it [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3480.14s)]
*  There's they've never had more money and yet they're like laying off people from all of like the civil rights stuff because they're no longer [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3485.02s)]
*  The pretense no longer matters. They no longer have to hide [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3491.1s)]
*  yeah, but they're all about but I don't think they I don't think it works that way is what i'm saying because like [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3495.02s)]
*  the the reason why uh israel is uniparty aside from it being a [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3500.46s)]
*  A really important part of american foreign policy at least according to the people who are making these decisions [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3506.54s)]
*  I don't think it should be but [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3512.38s)]
*  but there's also a lot of advocacy in liberal circles that [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3515.2599999999998s)]
*  that keeps up [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3519.02s)]
*  The the idea that it's like a moral nation and there's gay rights happening there as opposed to all these other like barbaric [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3520.62s)]
*  Islamic countries islamic style countries where they kill you right like women have rights that sort of shit [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3526.54s)]
*  When when the adl and other jewish advocacy groups and like institutions actually completely [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3531.82s)]
*  Drop the the notion that they are in any way shape or form liberal [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3537.1s)]
*  That truly limits their opportunity and it turns it into like a partisan issue [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3540.94s)]
*  This goes though back to what my point earlier about like people versus power [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3544.54s)]
*  It's like yeah, like they've given up on the generational struggle [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3547.66s)]
*  But they have a gazillion dollars and they'll be able to like have enough people who will happily hump the pile of money forever [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3550.46s)]
*  That they can do that and like I think in the adl's case [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3556.38s)]
*  It's like yeah [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3558.7799999999997s)]
*  They no longer care about being part of like the consensus building project in the way that it was in the past half century [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3559.5s)]
*  Now it's interested in enforcing hegemony from above by spending down all those pro-israel dollars that they've gotten that have like [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3566.2999999999997s)]
*  But like their budget has like gone up many times over as a result of this pivot [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3572.7799999999997s)]
*  I just don't think that there is uh, there's as much of a lifeline for groups like this [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3577.1s)]
*  But maybe i'm too hopeful like I agree with you in the long run [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3581.58s)]
*  I just don't know how long that is but I agree with you [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3585.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's just I don't think you can square those circles. I agree [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3587.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think the israeli project is like as we understood it in our lifetime is over [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3590.62s)]
*  that is not like wishful thinking I think it's like definitely over in the in the way that like [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3596.06s)]
*  like I [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3601.98s)]
*  It is forever, uh tarnished. It's a good reputation that it built over multiple decades of steady propaganda [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3603.58s)]
*  But there will still be people that are defending it. It's like here, but here's the thesis, right? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3611.9s)]
*  Their thesis like the thing that they like believe in that like justifies that change in tac [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3616.94s)]
*  Is the idea that like we are entering a a a time in which like that by part that idea of like consensus on like a [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3622.06s)]
*  Like being on both side chambers of the house or whatever is like no longer is valuable and that like what matters more [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3630.94s)]
*  Is about like being part of like the you know, I mean granted like by the way [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3637.98s)]
*  I will say I don't think that they're in any danger of like losing their purchase on the large parts of the democratic party [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3642.54s)]
*  For a long while yet what we're describing is like a very long-term shift [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3648.46s)]
*  That's going to be affected once the people in the democratic party who like love israel essentially all die off [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3651.9s)]
*  Because that's that's just that's just what's happening. Yeah, I mean they they're the moneyed interest stuff [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3658.38s)]
*  Definitely works [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3664.62s)]
*  In american congress, they they do have tremendous purchase like literally [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3666.54s)]
*  It's I mean they buy they can buy a lot of stuff a large part of this though goes down to like this is [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3670.94s)]
*  What hegemony is on the level of like if you make if you create like all these implicit punishments [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3675.82s)]
*  Forgoing against the demanded consensus on this shit then like people will just do it. You know, like it's it's all [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3682.54s)]
*  It won't hold but will make it not hold as you were saying will just be that like you can't [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3690.62s)]
*  You can't lie about being everything for everybody when you're just like one thing for one particular person [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3696.46s)]
*  over and over again to the point that you'll like literally get in bed with the guy being like [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3701.82s)]
*  So I think you what do you think the jews have to do for white people? Yeah, like, you know [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZFGp-oJFE&t=3706.14s)]
