**HasanAbi:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY)
*  I also don't believe in this context that it's really, I think it's important. I think these are important stories to tell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=0.0s)]
*  C.A.D. has a lot of connections down there, knows a lot of the people who are living on the street. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  We're going to talk to some of those people. They're very interesting people. Some of them are veterans. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=10.96s)]
*  Some of them are, you know, obviously dealing with disability and we're going to learn more about their lives. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=16.72s)]
*  Bro, you cannot be serious with that fit. Are you going to actually wear that? Bro, look at this man, dude. That's crazy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=22.48s)]
*  The fact that you are even entertaining this shirt is out to me. What do you mean? What did you get? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=35.36s)]
*  Books again? Nerd ass. This is my Nosferatu fit. You're like a child who went and watched a movie and now thinks he's Superman. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Actually, how do you know that? My name is Thomas Hutter. I don't know. Is that a Nosferatu reference? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you would know that if you saw the movie. I did not see the movie. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  Real. Anyway, Lola, what are we doing today? You want to explain to people what we're doing today? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I'll explain a second. I got you something. Oh, God. Here we go from book soup. Oh, my shout out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=65.28s)]
*  Book soup in L.A. This is very special. Ready? Did you get it for yourself? I got it for you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=70.64s)]
*  You have a higher autism score than me. You literally have a higher. You have a higher autism score than me. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=77.12s)]
*  Discovering the new faces of neurodiversity. Unmasking Autism by Devin Price, PhD. Author of Lazy Dis does not exist. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=83.36s)]
*  Thank you. That's for you. This is I got this for me. Have you heard about this? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=93.12s)]
*  No. It's supposed to be very good. It's about it's a rejection by Tony, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=97.76s)]
*  the Lithium Mute rejection. Anyway, I'm going to read that one. Yeah, I know you could read the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=102.8s)]
*  Unmasking Autism book. I never get rejected. So it don't matter to me. You know what I mean? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=109.52s)]
*  OK, so what's up? All right. Wait, should I take this fit off? No, you can keep the fit on. I don't [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=113.68s)]
*  care. Yeah. My man is my man is deep in the Seinfeld pocket, but not in a creepy way. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=119.28s)]
*  Not even not in a way where he's emulating the other stuff that Jerry did in his personal life. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=125.6s)]
*  Which we will not talk about. 1738. Are you hungry? No, I'm good. Good. Because my dad is making me food [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=133.28s)]
*  and I didn't ask him to make you food because I didn't know when you were coming. Thank you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=142.24s)]
*  You're welcome. So what are we doing today? You're supposed to explain it. Oh, sorry, guys. Yeah, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=146.24s)]
*  good. I'm glad I'm wearing this outfit to explain this. Nobody asked you to put the outfit on. You [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=151.44s)]
*  said put your cool shirt on. I like it. You said it looked good. Never said that. But go on. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=156.8s)]
*  So we're going to head. Well, we're going to go get some materials and supplies. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=163.04s)]
*  There are some people who are living on the street or housing insecure people. And a friend of mine, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=170.4s)]
*  Sadie, who works with Waterdrop LA, which is a great organization that we will learn more about [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=178.4s)]
*  today that provides water to the people on Skid Row. And Skid Row is like a whole area in Los [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=185.76s)]
*  Angeles where there are many people living on the street and many housing insecure people. And [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=191.68s)]
*  there's also obviously people who are dealing with drug addiction and problems there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=197.84s)]
*  And I said to Hassan a few days ago, actually before the information came out about the increase [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=202.32s)]
*  in the homeless percentage, I had said, Oh, we should have these friends who work with [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=208.88s)]
*  these organizations on Skid Row. Let's go there. I think it would be good. I thought I said, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it was you. Sorry. It was this on. Yeah. I thought I saw it was his idea. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=218.64s)]
*  We could do something. I thought I said we should do something like that. And you were like, Oh, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=222.88s)]
*  I have a friend. Sure. Yes. I'm sorry. It was this was actually making it seem like not my idea at [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  all. This was all Hassan's original idea. We can look back at the text messages to see who presented [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=232.88s)]
*  the idea first. If you would like to do that, but I'm not going to want to pull them on. But anyway, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=238.32s)]
*  I think it will be very eye opening. I also don't believe in this context that it's really, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=244.4s)]
*  I think it's important. I think these are important stories to tell. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=251.2s)]
*  C.A.D. has a lot of connections down there knows a lot of the people who are living on the street. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=254.88s)]
*  We're going to talk to some of those people. They're very interesting people. Some of them [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=259.28s)]
*  are veterans. Some of them are, you know, obviously dealing with disability. And we're going to learn [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=262.64s)]
*  more about their lives. What's this? Why do you do this to me? What do you mean? Why do you do? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=269.68s)]
*  You're the one drinking out of it. That's you. Why are you exposing your drinking about my drinking? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=273.68s)]
*  I don't do anything. My undying love and loyalty for Joseph Robinette Rogan. Listen, you're all [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=278.08s)]
*  the signs are there. All the signs are here. It's going to happen, guys. It's happening. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=284.64s)]
*  There's nothing you can do about it. Are you bringing them care packages? We're going to get [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=290.08s)]
*  tarps, some clothing for the most part. But I have, I went into my, I went into my closet. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=295.12s)]
*  I went into my closet and basically took like hundreds and I mean hundreds and it's not like [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  maybe one tenth of what I can do right now. But hundreds of hoodies and jackets [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=309.44000000000005s)]
*  that I have that have been sent to me from various organizations throughout the years [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=318.88s)]
*  for free. Many of them have never been worn. Wait, it's what someone, okay. No, sorry. Go ahead. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=327.12s)]
*  So basically I, you asked Sadie if there's any need for clothing and they said like, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=335.44s)]
*  they don't have a lot of large men's clothing. So I was like, that's perfect. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=340.96s)]
*  Large Turkish men's clothing. Yeah. Someone in chat said that I couldn't get DND. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=344.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's not true. Okay. That's a work in progress. He doesn't want to do it. So I spoke [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=351.92s)]
*  to Brennan Lee Mulligan, who if you guys know, sorry, I'm just bringing this up because I'm [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=357.52s)]
*  saying it right now. He is very interested in DMing a charity DND event. And I've also spoken to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=362.08s)]
*  Will about this because Will has like a space apparently where we can do this thing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=372.8s)]
*  And I'm hoping that it'll happen in 2025. But yes, there are, you have to, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=379.2s)]
*  hurting these people is like hurting cats. Okay. It's impossible to get this man to do anything. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=384.64s)]
*  He doesn't want to do this. Okay. What it's true. He's a big time diva. Yeah. As you know, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzxfY5-CnY&t=388.72s)]
