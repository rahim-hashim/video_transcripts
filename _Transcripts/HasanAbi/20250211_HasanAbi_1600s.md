# Elon Musk Joins Donald Trump As He Signs Executive Orders | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM)
*  You will see it America overspending issue is bad. You will think future later Elon not perfect, but he's smart [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=0.0s)]
*  Dog I am NOT saying that the American government is not wasteful or even engaging in fraudulent activities [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=7.12s)]
*  I'm simply stating that these guys are not actually tackling that okay [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Like what do you mean a mine like yeah, there's a limestone mine [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=25.2s)]
*  We restore all the retirement paperwork [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=29.1s)]
*  That look and you look a picture of this at a picture of this might all post some pictures afterwards [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=32.58s)]
*  And this this mine looks like something out of the 50s because it was started in 1955 [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=36.74s)]
*  so it looks like it's like a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  Time warp and then that the speed then the limiting factor is the speed at which the mine shaft elevator can move [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  Determines how many people can retire from the federal? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=51.06s)]
*  federal government [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=54.06s)]
*  Down and sometimes and then you can't nobody can retire [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=55.46s)]
*  Doesn't that sound crazy [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=60.18s)]
*  There's like a thousand people that work on this so I think if we take those people and say like you know what instead [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=61.94s)]
*  of working in a mine shaft and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=67.5s)]
*  carry Manila envelopes to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=70.02s)]
*  You know boxes in a mine shaft [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=72.34s)]
*  You could do practically anything else and you you would add to the the goods and services of the United States [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=74.66s)]
*  in a more useful way [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=81.98s)]
*  So [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=84.10000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, so I think you know that's an example [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  Like at a high level if you say like how do we increase prosperity is we get people to do to? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=88.5s)]
*  shift from roles that are low to negative productivity to high productivity roles [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  And so increase the total output of goods and services which means that there's a higher standard of living available for everyone [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=98.5s)]
*  That's that's the actual goal [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=105.18s)]
*  I [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=107.18s)]
*  Want to including a lot of Democrats I have detractors you do sir [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=115.18s)]
*  I don't believe it say that you're orchestrating a hostile takeover of government and doing it in a non-transparent way [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=119.10000000000001s)]
*  What's your response to that criticism? Well first of all? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=126.7s)]
*  You couldn't ask for a stronger mandate from from the public the public voted [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  You know that we have a majority of the public vote voting for President Trump [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=138.14000000000001s)]
*  Won the house it won the Senate [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=143.26000000000002s)]
*  The people voted for major government reform [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  There should be no doubt about that that was on the campaign the president spoke about that at every rally the people voted for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=151.74s)]
*  Major government reform and that's what people are going to get they're going to get what they voted for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=158.86s)]
*  And a lot of times that you know people that don't get what they voted for but in this presidency [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=163.78s)]
*  They are going to get what they voted for and that's what democracy is all about [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=168.74s)]
*  The White House says that you will identify and excuse yourself from any conflicts of interest that you may have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=175.34s)]
*  Does that mean that you are in effect? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=181.02s)]
*  Policing yourself what are the checks and balances that are in place to ensure that there is accountability and transparency? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=183.02s)]
*  Well we actually are trying to be as transparent as possible in fact our actions we post our actions to the Doge handle [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=189.54s)]
*  On X and to the Doge website so all of our actions are maximally transparent in fact. Yeah totally [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=197.06s)]
*  Virtually everything that they've tackled in terms of like combating [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=205.38s)]
*  Weird spending habits or whatever are just things that the government spends money on that sounds stupid [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=210.3s)]
*  Or is against like the Republican agenda [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=217.0s)]
*  Right or even if it's not something against the Republican agenda the broader Republican agenda they present it as though it is right [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=220.36s)]
*  They'll say like oh, we're giving condoms to Hamas. That's like a great example of this right when that's not the case [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=227.24s)]
*  now that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=234.36s)]
*  That is not going to be like you're not going to be able to put a dent in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=235.96s)]
*  American government spending that way when you're finding like [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=240.6s)]
*  $200,000 or [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=244.84s)]
*  $46,000 that was spent on one thing or $200,000 was spent on another thing the American government is major. It's massive. It's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=246.28s)]
*  incredibly costly [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=253.8s)]
*  Okay, and doing this in the stupidest ways possible without actually hiring [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=255.8s)]
*  Regulators ironically that understand what these programs are like with proper audits with proper auditors and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=262.8s)]
*  Trying to undermine it across the board is of course leading to all of these issues [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  That you have seen so far with like mass layoffs or the threat of mass layoffs that don't make any sense whatsoever [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=275.92s)]
*  Do got checked by the judicial branch and called it a coup checks and balances don't exist with the guy [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  That's what I mean and the last line of defense that barely exists now is the judicial branch saying yeah, you can't just [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=289.8s)]
*  You can't just decide to lay off the entirety of the federal government [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  Labor force like you can't do that. These are [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=302.36s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people that rely on a paycheck from the government. That's so stupid [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=304.88s)]
*  like of interest and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=310.8s)]
*  We watch that also [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=312.72s)]
*  It's a big is this way. We want him doing this. We don't want a [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=314.32s)]
*  An unsuccessful guy doing this now one thing also that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=318.16s)]
*  Elon hasn't really mentioned are the groups of people that are getting some of these payments [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=323.12s)]
*  They're ridiculous and we're talking about billions of dollars that we've already found. We found fraud and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=328.06s)]
*  Abuse I would say those two words as opposed to the third word that I know the condom story wasn't just condoms [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=334.92s)]
*  And it wasn't use it was mosaic because it wasn't just condoms [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=341.48s)]
*  Things there was a broader anti HIV [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  Prove it was a broader HIV prevention initiative that exists in Africa, but we're talking about [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=349.92s)]
*  Tens of billions of dollars that we've already found and now a judge is an activist judge [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=356.04s)]
*  Wants to try and stop us from doing this. Why and why would they want to do that? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  I can't paint on this. I can't paint on the fact that I said government Mozambique Gaza and it is very [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  Frothed no, it's not that's the problem [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=373.48s)]
*  You can't just you can't just declare something to be a fraud because you don't personally like it. Okay [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=376.68s)]
*  The simplest example is contraceptives [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  Let's say that there is enough people within the Republican government that consider contraceptives to be [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  Unchristian like and there are plenty of people who think contraceptives are unchristian like you can't just say oh, it's fraudulent to spend [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=393.36s)]
*  this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  Pre-allocated these pre-allocated funds on contraceptive programs in Africa in an effort to combat sexually transmitted diseases [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=402.56s)]
*  Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean it's fraud [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=410.68s)]
*  It's ridiculous [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=415.44s)]
*  You call that incompetence maybe it could be corruption it could be a deals made on both sides, you know where [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=419.8s)]
*  Yeah, I guess the money he kicked. I think he's a lot of kickback here [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=425.92s)]
*  A tremendous kickback this whole must purges built upon a rhetorical sleight of hand that everything is ideal everything [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=430.08s)]
*  I ideologically disagree with because woken gay is per se waste abuse and fraud and no one in our media highlights this massive category error [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=435.32s)]
*  That is actually kind of important big part of it [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=442.08s)]
*  And I hope that the court system is going to allow us to do what we have to do [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=444.54s)]
*  We got elected to to among other things find all of this [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=450.38s)]
*  Fraud abuse all of this this horrible stuff going on and we've already found billions of dollars [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=454.0s)]
*  not like a little bit billions many billions of dollars and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=460.52s)]
*  When you get down to it, it's gonna be [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=466.08s)]
*  Probably close to a trillion dollars. It could be close to a trillion dollars that we're gonna find. No [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=468.8s)]
*  That part is completely ridiculous. You are not cutting a trillion dollars with the government spending. Okay, I wish [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=474.56s)]
*  Anybody for that but he has certain leanings and he wants us to stop looking [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=484.08s)]
*  How do you stop looking? I mean we've already found it. We have a case in New York where a hotel has paid 59 million dollars [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=489.24s)]
*  Because of because it's housing [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=498.04s)]
*  migrants dude [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=500.76s)]
*  Additionally funny Trump is saying this because he did this with the Trump hotels when he was president. He literally did this [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=502.44s)]
*  He did this exact same thing with [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=508.52s)]
*  Trump properties while he was president [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  He would only hire you would get Secret Service to stay in his own properties to pay [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=514.32s)]
*  exorbitant fees [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=521.12s)]
*  to his own [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=522.48s)]
*  fucking properties [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=524.12s)]
*  In half of two trillion to one trillion and it's really two things [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=526.12s)]
*  competence and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  Caring and if you add competence and caring you'll cut the budget deficit in half [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=532.36s)]
*  And and and I fully expect to be scrutinized you will see an America overspending issue is bad [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=538.0s)]
*  You will think future later Elon not perfect, but he's smart [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=543.48s)]
*  Dog, I am NOT saying that the American government is not wasteful or even engaging in fraudulent activities [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=547.44s)]
*  I'm simply stating that these guys are not actually tackling that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=555.36s)]
*  Okay, if they were looking at genuine fraud they would end up harming a lot of their you know important corporate benefactors [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=560.24s)]
*  So of course, they're not gonna do that. They're not gonna go after for example the military [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=568.52s)]
*  Okay, you want to know how I know that they're not gonna go after the military and fraudulent extra spending for no reason [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  Because Donald Trump has already said he's signing off on additional billion dollars [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=579.44s)]
*  additional billions of dollars in [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=584.2s)]
*  His contracts to the state of Israel, for example [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=586.4000000000001s)]
*  Okay [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=589.96s)]
*  If they wanted to if they wanted to stop [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=591.0s)]
*  I like these picking his nose on cameras hilarious [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=594.44s)]
*  like if they wanted to go after fraud and waste they would not take out the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=597.44s)]
*  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=602.44s)]
*  Okay, how is that taking out fraud that is an agency tasked with has helped consumers [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  They've recovered 21 billion dollars of fraudulent and and wasteful expenses that these fucking criminal [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  Corporations have actually a force upon the American public for the price point of one billion dollars the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has actually [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=619.0s)]
*  Given back to the American public 21 billion dollars. Okay [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=627.88s)]
*  You really think they're tackling fraud or do you think they're making it easier? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=633.4s)]
*  To steal from the American public to make it easier for corporations to keep grafting you when you're looking at something [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=637.88s)]
*  You'll find you're looking for one out of a hundred [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=644.68s)]
*  Here you're almost reversing it you look for one that's good [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=647.04s)]
*  Yeah, and you can look at the title and you say why are we doing this? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=650.8399999999999s)]
*  Why are we doing that and the public gets it? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=654.5999999999999s)]
*  You know the public gets it you've seen the polls the public is saying why are we paying all this money this for years? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=656.8s)]
*  This has gone on [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Trump is moving to reverse medical debt and overdraft protections implemented by the CFPB Wow, how wonderful for the American public? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  I [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=672.16s)]
*  Know this we're finding tremendous fraud and tremendous abuse [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=674.16s)]
*  If only there were people that wasn't if only there were more people and not just like random dumbass twitchdreamers like myself [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=678.56s)]
*  Actively talking about this every time they had an opportunity to talk about this instead of talking about USAID and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=687.24s)]
*  How we must defend USAID and if we don't defend USAID then China is gonna take over [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=694.64s)]
*  Like instead of saying shit like that, maybe they should talk about this. I don't know [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=698.96s)]
*  The only other the only other media outlets that I've ever heard this kind of commentary from is myself [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=704.28s)]
*  Michael from Pennsylvania [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=711.36s)]

*  majority report [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=718.32s)]
*  What is going on? Where is the Democratic Party? This is 100% an abdication of duty [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=719.96s)]
*  Okay, it shouldn't be up to drop site news majority report myself and and some others that are actively saying [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=726.16s)]
*  This is a ridiculous thing that they're doing. It is actually not beneficial for the American public [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=733.48s)]
*  This is a horrible thing to do, especially when you have someone that is responsive to [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  Populous sentiment. Okay, it's crazy [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=744.56s)]
*  It's crazy to me that Hakeem Jeffries is not talking about this every goddamn day [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=747.64s)]
*  Okay, it's crazy to me that the Democratic Party is not going on every news outlet and saying look at what they're doing [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=752.66s)]
*  Look what they're doing. They claim to be on the side of the American public instead. They're just showing their bellies, dude [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=759.22s)]
*  He also Chuck Schumer also said they're not gonna put up a [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=769.5s)]
*  Government spending fight as well, which I think is ridiculous. I think there are they are gonna do that. I suspect that would be insane [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=773.9s)]
*  The Republicans are already shutting down [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=782.82s)]
*  Good chunks of the government [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=786.14s)]
*  And no, this isn't hypocrisy baiting chatter. What are you talking about? This is directly saying [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=788.38s)]
*  This is directly saying that the Republicans are currently actively doing harm to the American public [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=796.0600000000001s)]
*  Okay, do you understand? It's not about like oh look at the look at the hypocrites [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=803.5s)]
*  They said they care about the workers, but here's what they're doing. That's not what I'm saying [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=808.38s)]
*  I'm saying communicate that they're harming the workers. This is more than hypocrisy baiting hypocrisy baiting is when you say that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=811.54s)]
*  Trump's border wall is stupid and you're racist for defending it and then turning around and being like we are the ones who actually [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=818.74s)]
*  Want to build a border wall Trump doesn't want to build a border wall any longer [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=824.9399999999999s)]
*  That's dumbass hypocrisy baiting that makes you look like an idiot [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=829.2199999999999s)]
*  Okay [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=834.18s)]
*  That makes you look like you got caught that Trump was right all along that immigrants do constitute a [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=835.3s)]
*  National security threat and that you got caught and now you're going oopsie [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=840.46s)]
*  I guess we want to build the border wall now everyone can see that you're the hypocrite in that situation [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=844.62s)]
*  You're the dumbass in that situation saying that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is actually [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=849.9399999999999s)]
*  responsible for 21 billion dollars of [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=855.8199999999999s)]
*  fraudulent and wasteful and criminal [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=859.14s)]
*  Expenditures that the American public had to pay for the American consumers had to pay for [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=862.74s)]
*  Okay, and then turning around and abolishing that agency being an overall burden [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=868.22s)]
*  Directly talking about medical debt on your credit card directly talking about overdraft fees things that every single American [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=874.26s)]
*  Things that every single American can understand because at a certain point they have experienced this. Okay, they've experienced these problems [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=882.54s)]
*  They should remind people why they no longer experience some of these problems [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=891.22s)]
*  It is because of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau same with Lena con and all of the initiatives from Lena con [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=895.8s)]
*  taking out Lena con is a [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  massively [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=905.9599999999999s)]
*  Consequential move. Anyway, let's continue listening to this dumbass now [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=907.24s)]
*  and [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=911.76s)]
*  We are we are moving fast. So we will make mistakes, but we'll also fix the mistakes very quickly [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=913.24s)]
*  so [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=918.12s)]
*  I [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=920.6s)]
*  Think that there are some worthy things but but overall if you say what does the bank of the buck? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=921.6s)]
*  I would say it was not very good [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  And there was far too much of what USAID was doing was influencing [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  influencing elections in ways that I think were dubious and do not stand the light of day [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=934.76s)]
*  If you have received billions of dollars in contracts from the Pentagon [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=943.08s)]
*  And the president's directing you to look into the Department of Defense [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=947.76s)]
*  Yes, we definitely need to do it are going to do present a conflict of interest for you [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=950.5200000000001s)]
*  I know because you'd have to look at the individual contract and say first of all, I'm not the one you know [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=954.32s)]
*  filing the contract [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=960.24s)]
*  It's people at SpaceX or some which it will be putting for the contract and I'd like to say if you see any contract where? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=961.2s)]
*  The word it was water to SpaceX and it wasn't by far the best value for money for the taxpayer [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=967.0400000000001s)]
*  Let me know because every one of them was [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=971.88s)]
*  The president said the other day that you might look at treasuries [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  Could you explain that a little bit what kind of fraud or and that question goes to both of you? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=978.6800000000001s)]
*  What kind of fraud are you expecting to see or do you see right now in US treasuries? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think you mean the Treasury Department as opposed to Treasury bills or [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=988.6s)]
*  Well the as I mentioned earlier really the the first order of business is to make sure we're actually collecting a story of this [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=996.24s)]
*  Although my son might enjoy this but it's he's sticking his fingers in my ears and stuff [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1004.2s)]
*  This bit hot here sometimes hey something [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1010.32s)]
*  So [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1014.12s)]
*  No, the stuff we're doing with with the Treasury Department is so basic that you can't believe it doesn't exist already [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1015.88s)]
*  so so [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1022.9200000000001s)]
*  So for example, it's like what type of payment is this? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1024.72s)]
*  You can't just leave the field blank currently many things that the fields left blank [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1029.0s)]
*  We and you have to describe what's the payment for some basic rationalization that also is left blank [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1033.24s)]
*  So this is why the Pentagon wins less on the Pentagon passed an order to make that get ago maybe [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1038.44s)]
*  ever really [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1044.08s)]
*  And we want to just in order to actually pass audits. You have to have financial information that allows you to trace the payments [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1045.8s)]
*  so [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1054.1200000000001s)]
*  You know and once a while the the the Treasury has to test to pause payments [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1056.0s)]
*  If it thinks the payment is going to a fraudulent organization [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1061.16s)]
*  like [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1065.96s)]
*  if [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1067.48s)]
*  What [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1070.7600000000002s)]
*  To get on that payment that I'm doing a payless it means that this is someone who payless it means that this is someone that [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1076.48s)]
*  Is just like dead people [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1082.92s)]
*  terrorists [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1086.2s)]
*  known fraudsters [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1087.8400000000001s)]
*  That kind of thing we should not pay them but currently we do which is crazy we should stop that [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1090.32s)]
*  And by the way hundred team and [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1099.0s)]
*  For the sake of the country [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1103.1999999999998s)]
*  I hope that the person that's in charge and the other people that report to me that are in charge [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1104.8s)]
*  Are allowed to do the right thing namely make sure everything's honest, legitimate and competent [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1111.08s)]
*  But we're looking at just when you look at USAID that was that's one we're gonna look at the military [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1117.32s)]
*  We're gonna look at education [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1124.12s)]
*  They're much bigger areas [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1125.8s)]
*  But the USAID is really corrupt [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1127.8s)]
*  It's good. It's a good the stream. It's all it's decent now and I can't imagine a judge saying well [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1130.96s)]
*  It may be corrupt but you don't have the right you got elected to look over the country and to as we say make America [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1136.96s)]
*  great again, but you don't have the right to go and [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1143.76s)]
*  As we say make America great again [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1146.32s)]
*  but you don't have the right to go and look and see whether or not things are right that they're paying or that things are [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1148.48s)]
*  Honest that they're paying and [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1154.24s)]
*  Nobody can even believe there's other people law professors right away [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1156.36s)]
*  You're supposed to be running the country [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1159.84s)]
*  But we're not allowed to look and who they're paying it to and what they're paying we have [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1161.28s)]
*  Massive amounts of fraud that we caught I think we probably caught way over a lot of billions of dollars already in [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1166.44s)]
*  What two weeks yes, and it's gonna go to numbers that you're not gonna believe and [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1174.2800000000002s)]
*  Much as I said much is incompetence and much is dishonesty [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1180.2s)]
*  We have to catch it and the only way we're gonna catch it is to look for it [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1183.2800000000002s)]
*  And if a judge is gonna say you're not allowed to look for it [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1186.8000000000002s)]
*  That's pretty sad for our country. I don't understand how it could even work [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1190.5200000000002s)]
*  Which one the buyout program the offer to federal workers [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1197.5200000000002s)]
*  It can you personally guarantee that the workers who opt-in to resign now will be paid [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1200.6000000000001s)]
*  But they're getting a good deal. They're getting a big buyout and what we're trying to do is reduce government [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1205.92s)]
*  We have too many people we have office space. It's occupied by 4% [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1211.6000000000001s)]
*  Nobody's showing up to work because they were told not to and then Biden gave them a five-year pass some of them [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1216.0800000000002s)]
*  48,000 of them gave him a five-year pass that for five years you don't have I'm more conservative serious question because I honestly don't know [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1222.92s)]
*  Are liberals thinking what they are claiming to find in USA it is lies [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1229.32s)]
*  No liberals are saying that USAID is a profoundly important aspect of American foreign policy [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1232.76s)]
*  That works to continue American dominance by doing soft power initiatives around the globe [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1240.28s)]
*  Some of those initiatives are actually good for the overall [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1247.24s)]

*  Okay, having said that however, there is a lot of there is a lot of just insanity in the way that they're [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1282.72s)]
*  targeting things like they'll just be like, oh well, they're giving [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1291.32s)]
*  $40,000 to a Guatemalan Transplay and then you look it up and it's actually like a joint partnership agreement to fund the arts [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1294.6000000000001s)]

*  It's a way to believe the propaganda that liberals have put forth [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1337.24s)]
*  Okay, it's ironic [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1341.96s)]
*  Because that means you genuinely believe that the American government is doing things because they're kind [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1344.44s)]
*  You have to be a real dumbass to think that the American government is doing things because they're kind [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1350.2800000000002s)]

*  Eventually utilize the existing relationships that they've developed on the ground [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1365.8s)]
*  For whatever suits their purpose. Also, none of it is fraudulent [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1370.2s)]
*  Okay [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1374.8799999999999s)]
*  As Adam Johnson [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1376.8799999999999s)]
*  Mentions here everything I ideologically disagree with because it's woke and gay does not mean it's waste abuse and fraud [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1379.68s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1387.6s)]

*  So I think it's stupid and bad and abuse and fraud is a ridiculous way to do this [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1394.7199999999998s)]
*  Okay [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1399.76s)]
*  Unintelligent person alive three if you're really implying that USAID is not done out of pure goodness of the American heart then name one [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1400.7199999999998s)]

*  It would be easier for me to name one thing that America has done [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1411.1999999999998s)]
*  That is there's a lot of things that are wrong in the last 50 years [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1414.6799999999998s)]
*  America has done that is there's there's nothing I can name in general that America has done for the [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1417.28s)]
*  In the name of good, okay [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1424.1200000000001s)]
*  Even Ukraine is a great example of what I'm talking about [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1426.24s)]
*  Ukraine is on the right side in terms of morality. Okay, Ukraine has an understandable moral position [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1429.96s)]
*  to rid its national borders of a military invasion [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1436.92s)]
*  America's interest in Ukraine, however, which Trump basically revealed [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1443.0s)]
*  Openly is not so you can't go wrong back in Ukraine [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1447.5s)]
*  That's it [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1451.58s)]
*  You have to you have to look at the situation and truly believe that America is always doing good things around the world [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1452.3s)]
*  For you to assume [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1459.22s)]
*  For for you to assume that their their intentions Ukraine is good. Even if they openly state [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1461.22s)]
*  That their intentions are not pure their intentions are impure [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1466.9s)]
*  It's also short-sighted policy because there's a funding after-school programs for undeserved communities de I and fraud [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1472.2199999999998s)]
*  But the role of that program is a decrease incarceration saving the state money. For example, it can also be self-serving [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1476.9799999999998s)]
*  Yes [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1480.9799999999998s)]
*  a lot of those things a lot of the initiatives like that after-school programs and whatnot seem costly [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1481.3799999999999s)]
*  wasteful and stupid [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1488.9799999999998s)]
*  Like they'll be like, oh dude, they're doing violin [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1490.9799999999998s)]
*  They're doing like musical education lessons in in the south side of Chicago or whatever [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1494.74s)]
*  and it's like yeah, that is an incredibly important initiative because [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1501.54s)]
*  As studies have shown time and time again after-school programs actually [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1505.7s)]
*  Significantly lower [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1511.36s)]
*  At-risk youths likelihood to go and do crimes. Okay, they're not doing it because they're woke and gay [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1513.62s)]
*  They're doing it because it obviously it's obviously beneficial [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1520.5s)]
*  It saves the government more money down the line as well [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1525.78s)]
*  If they if these kids are not doing crime and then getting [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1528.18s)]
*  One doing crime obviously is chaotic. They're stealing cars and whatever are obviously you don't want like property loss in general [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1533.54s)]
*  for the broader public [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1541.14s)]
*  but it's also better overall for the government now that you don't have to like [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1542.74s)]
*  Put a bunch of children in the in the system [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1546.9s)]
*  at an early age [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1550.1000000000001s)]
*  but that requires [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1551.78s)]
*  That requires you to one do a little bit of reading that in order to understand these initiatives [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1554.74s)]
*  And the long-term impact of said initiatives that requires you to imagine [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1560.66s)]
*  a an alternative [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1565.62s)]
*  Instead of simply closing your eyes and going nah, dude. I have these races beliefs that these guys are intrinsically evil and inferior [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1567.78s)]
*  I won't say that they're inferior because of their race [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1576.26s)]
*  I'll say they're inferior because of their culture as a substitute for race and that [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1578.66s)]
*  No amount of violent lessons is going to stop these kids from stealing kiosks or whatever [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1584.42s)]
*  Okay, when all evidence points to the exact opposite that these initiatives are very helpful [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndblAtHWdGM&t=1589.54s)]
