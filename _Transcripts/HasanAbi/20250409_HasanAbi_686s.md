# Trump’s Gamble Is Crashing The Economy To Beat China | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0)
*  Look, look, look, look a lot of what Trump is doing today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, while it is insane and belligerent seemingly and causes a lot of instability in the markets. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=4.88s)]
*  What Trump is doing directionally is the same thing that previous administrations have been [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=12.88s)]
*  trying to do as well, but they don't have the same appetite for the Donald Trump has [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=18.2s)]
*  because Trump believes he can actually tank it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=22.84s)]
*  Anyway, Trump is responding to questions. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=30.72s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=32.36s)]
*  One trillion dollars off trade with the United States. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=33.84s)]
*  That's not right. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=36.72s)]
*  And now I've reversed it for a short period of time, but we made two billion dollars. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  We're making two billion dollars a day. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  And somebody had to do it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=46.96s)]
*  Roger was here a little while ago, one of the great financial people. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=50.4s)]
*  And he said he's been waiting for 40 years for somebody to do what I did over the last month. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=53.64s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=61.0s)]
*  This says this is subtitles. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=62.64s)]
*  Great financial people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=64.8s)]
*  And he said he's been waiting for 40 years for somebody to do what I did over the last month. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=66.04s)]
*  And if you didn't do it, you wouldn't have a country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=73.84s)]
*  It wouldn't be sustainable. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=75.84s)]
*  So I'm honored to have done it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=76.96s)]
*  And, you know, look, nothing's over yet, but we have a tremendous amount of spirit from other countries, including China. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=78.96s)]
*  China wants to make a deal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  They just don't know how quick to go about it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's one of those things. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=89.44s)]
*  They don't have a promise. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=90.6s)]
*  They want to make a deal. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=92.16s)]
*  And they do a proud man. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  I know him very well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=96.28s)]
*  And they don't know quite how to go about it, but they'll figure it out in the process of figuring it out. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=97.16s)]
*  But they want to make a deal. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  And we have other we have we have many other countries, as you know, many more than seventy five, and they all want to come. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=104.4s)]
*  They want to come here or they'll go to commerce or they'll go to Treasury. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=111.68s)]
*  We have our great senators here and congressmen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=115.36s)]
*  They'll call John to somebody. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=119.76s)]
*  They'll go through somebody, but they're all calling. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=121.56s)]
*  How do we do this? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=123.56s)]
*  They all want to make a deal. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=124.84s)]
*  Somebody had to do what we did. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  And I did a 90 day pause for the people that didn't retaliate because they told them, if you retaliate, we're going to double it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=127.52s)]
*  And that's what I did with China. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=134.68s)]
*  You've never seen a like this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=136.12s)]
*  Believe me. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=138.12s)]
*  We'll see how it all works out. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=138.68s)]
*  I think it's going to work out amazing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=139.8s)]
*  I think that our country is going to be at the end of a year or shorter. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=141.24s)]
*  But I think we're going to have something that nobody would have dreamt possible. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=145.56s)]
*  A man like Roger Penske, I don't want to get him in trouble with China, so I won't. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=150.08s)]
*  But he would know that you have to someday you have to cut the bow and you have to do what you have to do. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=153.96s)]
*  Right, Roger? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=159.84s)]
*  And that's what I did. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  And I'm very happy to have done it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  The Prime Minister of Greece just told Breitbart's Matt Boyle that he thinks absolutely the European Union and the United States could work out a trade deal that's win win and, quote, mutually beneficial to both sides. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=165.0s)]
*  What do you think about the Prime Minister's comments? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=176.8s)]
*  And do you think a deal could be struck with the European Union? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  First of all, I know him. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=181.36s)]
*  He's a good man. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  And I appreciate his comments. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=183.0s)]
*  Yeah, a deal could be made with every one of them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=184.52s)]
*  Deal. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=186.8s)]
*  A deal is going to be made with China. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=187.52s)]
*  A deal is going to be made with every one of them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  And there'll be fair deals. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  I just want fair. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  There will be fair deals for everybody. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  But they weren't fair to the United States. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=198.64s)]
*  They were sucking us dry. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=201.04s)]
*  And you can't do that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  You know, we have thirty six trillion dollars of debt for a reason. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=204.6s)]
*  We don't have it there for fun. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=208.48s)]
*  They have it for a reason. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=210.56s)]
*  And people took advantage of our country and they ripped us off for a very for decades. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  I've been thinking about this for decades. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  I've been if you ever saw me on television, I was young like these guys. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=219.64s)]
*  And I was like these guys. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I was talking about it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=228.39999999999998s)]
*  Nothing changed and nothing was done about it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=231.2s)]
*  Then I did it in my first term. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  I did it and did it well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  We took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China and others. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  And I started the process. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  But then we had a fix up from the covid mess caused by China. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=243.6s)]
*  We had a fix up from that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  And we did a good job of doing it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=248.6s)]
*  And when we handed back the reins after a rigged election and when we handed back the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=250.12s)]
*  reins, the stock market was higher than it was before covid coming in. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=254.56s)]
*  So, you know, we did a great job, but we didn't have time to do the big thing, which we're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=259.72s)]
*  doing now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=265.56s)]
*  And it's a it's like a patient is sick. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=266.88s)]
*  You have to do surgery. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=269.12s)]
*  Patient is very, very sick. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=270.2s)]
*  And Joe Biden handed us handed us over a country that was in very serious trouble [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=272.2s)]
*  economically and in every other way. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=279.36s)]
*  They let China run away with things. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  They let other countries run away with things. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  And maybe worst of all, in a certain way is what they did at the border. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=285.16s)]
*  We had people pouring into our country by the millions. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=288.48s)]
*  Many of them were murderers and drug lords and thieves and people from prisons from all [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=292.68s)]
*  over the world. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=298.24s)]
*  And there were people from mental institutions, insane asylums. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=299.64s)]
*  They were taking they were taking their mentally insane and they were dumping them into [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=304.36s)]
*  our country. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=309.84s)]
*  And I'll tell you, Tom Holman and Kristi Nohman doing a fantastic job in removing them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=310.84s)]
*  And now the courts, the Supreme Court just gave us numerous good rulings where we have [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  to be able to get them out. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  You had other judges trying to take over the system and think of it, they take over. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  They want these people coming back. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=329.08s)]
*  Trendy Iraq were from Venezuela to Venezuela jails that cut off the fingers of a man in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=330.56s)]
*  Colorado. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  They cut off his fingers because he called the police looking for help. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=339.24s)]
*  They said, did you call the police? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=341.92s)]
*  He said, yes, I did. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=344.16s)]
*  Put your hand down and they cut off the fingers. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=346.72s)]
*  This is what they want to bring these people back now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=348.68s)]
*  And I want to thank the president of El Salvador for the job he's done because that is that's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=351.44s)]
*  the way it has to be done. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=357.56s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=359.56s)]
*  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=360.56s)]
*  They've been talking about tariffs for decades. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  How come when these Democrat elites want tariffs? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=365.12s)]
*  They're not going to do things hunky-dory, but when President Trump wants tariffs, all [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=367.72s)]
*  hell breaks loose. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=370.3s)]
*  Do you see this double standard? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=371.3s)]
*  I love this guy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=372.3s)]
*  Whoever the hell that is. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=373.3s)]
*  That's really nice. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=376.38000000000005s)]
*  I appreciate that question. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=377.38000000000005s)]
*  No, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, everybody knew you had to do it, but they never had [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=378.38000000000005s)]
*  the guts to do it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=381.70000000000005s)]

*  They were saying about, see, just be cool. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  It's going to work out. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=389.34000000000003s)]

*  And it's working out. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=391.74s)]
*  I can tell you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=393.3s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=394.3s)]
*  Things are so good. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=395.3s)]
*  Things are so fine. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=396.94s)]
*  But I can say it's going to take a little conditioning. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=397.94s)]
*  It's a pretty good transition to greatness. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=402.94s)]
*  Why answer every dumb question when you can teach thousands at once? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=404.94s)]
*  Okay, take a week off. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=407.94s)]
*  And people investing in our country, they're going to do better than they've ever done [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=408.94s)]
*  before. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=413.34000000000003s)]
*  We have more car manufacturers, Roger, coming into our country. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  Now, speaking of cars, we've never seen anything like it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=417.62s)]
*  And they're coming in because of the election, but they're coming in because of the tariffs. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=421.06s)]
*  Let me start talking about a 25 or 50 or whatever it may be. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=425.42s)]
*  They don't want to pay that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=429.3s)]
*  They China and Taiwan's relationship right now in the midst of this conversation instead. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=430.3s)]
*  Building a plant. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=436.26s)]
*  They're all coming into the United States, Canada. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=437.5s)]
*  They're coming in from China. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=440.5s)]
*  They're coming. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=442.18s)]
*  They're coming in from everywhere. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=443.18s)]
*  And that's just cars. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=444.18s)]
*  We have chip makers come with the biggest chip maker in the world from Taiwan coming [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=446.14s)]
*  in, spending $3 billion to build plants and a big, mostly a big plant is a hell of a [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=450.44s)]
*  plant. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=455.52s)]
*  I usually do that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=456.52s)]
*  The kind of money that I just can't do that here right now in this moment. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=457.52s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=461.52s)]
*  You know, you'd say million would be the right number. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=462.52s)]
*  It's not two to 300 billion. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=463.8s)]
*  Million dollars. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=467.44s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=468.44s)]
*  300 billion dollars. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=469.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=470.44s)]
*  If you look at Apple, Apple is going to spend $500 billion building a plant. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=471.44s)]
*  They wouldn't be doing that if I didn't do this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=477.72s)]
*  Just keep building them in China. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's unsustainable. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not a pleasant thing to do. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=483.36s)]
*  But I appreciate the question. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=485.72s)]
*  And you know, interestingly, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy, they they've [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=487.76s)]
*  wanted to do this for years, but they never had a president that had the guts to do it [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=493.92s)]
*  because it does take guts. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=498.32s)]
*  Believe me. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=499.32s)]
*  Look, look, look, look, a lot of what Trump is doing today. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=500.32s)]
*  Well, while it is insane and belligerent, seemingly, and causes a lot of instability [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=505.71999999999997s)]
*  in the markets, what Trump is doing directionally is the same thing that previous administrations [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  have been trying to do as well. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=517.68s)]
*  But they don't have the same appetite for the Donald Trump has because Trump believes [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=520.3399999999999s)]
*  he can actually tank it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=524.1999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=526.72s)]
*  That's the major difference here. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=527.72s)]
*  Trump believes, perhaps foolishly, that he can tank it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=529.4s)]
*  But the goal here is the same decoupling our major, our largest trading partner and forcibly [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  severing ties with China and also rebuilding American manufacturing, not because you want [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=542.12s)]
*  it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  You care about the industrial base, not because you care about the manufacturing jobs coming [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  over here. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  That's why they openly say, I don't give a f we're going to build it cheap. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=556.16s)]
*  We're going to build it with robots. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=558.68s)]
*  OK. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  They say a bunch of fantastic things. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=561.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=564.08s)]
*  The only reason why they care about building a manufacturing base in the United States [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=565.44s)]
*  of America is because building a manufacturing base in the United States of America is because [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  of national security concerns. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=575.36s)]
*  The American government does not care about improving labor. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=577.48s)]
*  The American government does not care about fixing the problems of inequality here. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=580.6400000000001s)]
*  They only care about national security. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=587.0400000000001s)]
*  They only care about national security. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=590.72s)]
*  They want to build shit here so that China can't just turn off the manufacturing faucet [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=592.08s)]
*  and destroy the American empire when we go to war with them. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=599.6s)]
*  That is the point. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  That is the major reason. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=608.64s)]
*  We want to go to war with China and we can't go to war with China when we are so reliant [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=609.64s)]
*  on Chinese manufacturing. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=616.36s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=618.12s)]
*  And a part of that, a part of resetting the global economy that we have designed to rely [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=619.36s)]
*  on goods being manufactured overseas is to change the parity of the dollar, to change [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=628.08s)]
*  the currency exchange rate of the dollar and readjust it and devalue the purchasing power [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=636.48s)]
*  the dollar has. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=642.44s)]
*  That is what he wants to do. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=644.36s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=645.84s)]
*  That's a part of what he wants to do. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=646.84s)]
*  This is always going to be a painful process. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=648.94s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=651.82s)]

*  Wait, hold on. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=657.46s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=658.94s)]
*  I got groceries. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=659.94s)]

*  It was always going to cause market volatility. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=663.5400000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=665.98s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump is getting some of his wishes in the process. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=666.98s)]
*  I don't think he'll be able to actually rebuild manufacturing here. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiG5Yy_Ld0&t=671.9000000000001s)]
