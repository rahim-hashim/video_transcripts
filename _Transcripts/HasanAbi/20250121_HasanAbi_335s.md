# Conquering Dental Pain And Fears | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI)
*  I got cleaned up is crazy. Okay. I still don't know how to obviously laugh like I don't know how to smile. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=0.0s)]
*  So I will never be able to smile on photos. But at least like, you know, this dude when that plaque build-up goes away, dude. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=7.4s)]
*  Oh my God. When that tartar goes away that calcium. Oh my Lord, dude. This is nice. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=16.7s)]
*  How's the tooth old man? Incredible, immaculate, spectacular. I'm feeling fantastic. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=22.5s)]
*  One of the greatest decisions of all time was no longer putting off my dental work and actually getting it done. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=34.3s)]
*  I highly recommend it. If you have the money to do so many chatters will not. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=40.8s)]
*  Initially, the reason why I put it off was because I didn't have money. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=45.5s)]
*  And then afterwards I just kind of gave up on it for a very long time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=49.300000000000004s)]
*  Dental health is yes, very important, very critical for your overall health. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=53.7s)]
*  Okay, so, you know, it's been great. It's been great. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  My teeth are so freaking clean. Like it's not even is not a honey. It's not funny how clean they are. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  I got them shots. I got them cleaned up. I got them cleaned up is crazy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=69.4s)]
*  Okay, I still don't know how to obviously laugh like I don't know how to smile. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  So I will never be able to smile on photos. But at least like, you know, this dude when that plaque buildup goes away, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=80.19999999999999s)]
*  dude, oh my God, when that tartar goes away that calcium. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=89.1s)]
*  Oh my Lord, dude. This is nice. Hi. Hi. I don't know how to do it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=93.1s)]
*  Are you going to take on flossing now? I always I was Mr. Floss. I floss all the time. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=99.1s)]
*  I use a dental pick and everything like I love flossing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=102.9s)]
*  But just like for me for me, it's it's the gaps dude as someone who loves flossing as someone who loves flossing the dental work [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  that I got done like the deep cleaning that I got done in there opened up those gaps so much. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  And I love like I just personally love, you know, getting a floss all up in them gaps. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? I love that. I don't know why people always talk about like flossing as though it's like a thing that's difficult to do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=131.5s)]
*  But I think it's like even easier than brushing your teeth. What toothpaste do you use? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=138.7s)]
*  I use since the nine sensitive teeth. I have four teeth holes that need root canals and calves. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=143.3s)]
*  They say it's going to cost 12k. So I have to live with them until I can't and then let them pull them for free. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=148.5s)]
*  Oh, dude, I trust me. I know. I know how bad that is. That's my situation was bad. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=153.5s)]
*  Okay, I had I had a crown from many years ago, a root canal for many years ago that like literally flew off. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=159.7s)]
*  And that was because I grind my teeth too much. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=167.89999999999998s)]
*  So I just like literally was just like dismantling my my teeth piece by piece when I'm sleeping. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  And it was the worst, dude. It was the worst. It was the worst. It was the worst. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=180.1s)]
*  And y'all know y'all know what that's like. Okay, y'all know what that's like. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=184.6s)]
*  But I got them. I got them crowns now. We're good. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=187.9s)]
*  It depends on your dental structure. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Some people with overlaps are crooked can have a bit of pain when flossing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=192.8s)]
*  Yeah, I have a little bit of crookedness in the bottom row. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  Look, you can you can probably see but it was never so crooked that my parents were like you should probably get, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=198.9s)]
*  you know, all of your teeth busted and then, you know, have braces for an extended period of time. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  So I just never fixed it, but it's fine. I don't really mind it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=211.0s)]
*  Everyone's got to have a little bit of an imperfection. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=213.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? But overall, like I was saying very happy about that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=215.8s)]
*  Let them know they go into dental schools like USC or UCLA severely reduces the cost. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's true. I grind my I do grind my shit though. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=225.8s)]
*  I do be grinding it pretty hard. It's not good. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=230.4s)]
*  Hold on and the internal battery get an eye guard. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  Okay, people who use Haas mods are in several T. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=236.9s)]
*  So crooked extra tooth and have a middle tooth on the bottom. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=238.9s)]
*  Yeah, some people stuff is like real busted and you obviously have to you know, get it worked get it worked up and it's I feel like it's it's devastating in general. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=241.6s)]
*  Like he's workers is not great. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=252.1s)]
*  And I think also I've just had bad experiences with dentists when I was broke. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=255.5s)]
*  I felt like they were always trying to upsell me and that left a bad taste in my mouth. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=260.0s)]
*  No pun intended. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=264.0s)]
*  So I just kind of avoided going and also I think dental work used to be when I was younger. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=265.3s)]
*  It used to be a lot worse like a lot more painful a lot worse. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  Now you just go in there and they bust your shit up. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=275.6s)]
*  They just they go to just hit you with like the craziest local anesthetics and you don't feel a God thing and it's amazing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=278.7s)]
*  Like think about it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=286.8s)]
*  You can get you can get crazy work done and then you know be fine immediately after my dentist super chill to bro. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  They updated a dentist. It's not even scary now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=294.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  Like I don't know what it is. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=298.2s)]
*  I don't know what it is, but I feel like I don't know they patched it up. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=301.5s)]
*  They patched the dentist man. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=305.6s)]
*  They they really did some crazy patch notes on dental work where maybe when I was younger it was like a lot more. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=306.8s)]
*  It was just a lot scarier and I don't I don't consider it to be a scare anymore. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=313.3s)]
*  Maybe it's because I'm a grown man. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=316.6s)]
*  I don't know. Just wait to the zoomer chat. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=317.8s)]
*  Gbt dentist get into clinics. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=319.6s)]
*  Yeah, no, I will not be doing that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=321.8s)]
*  My dentist are always going to be over the age of 50 is because you never got your teeth clean not upselling you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJeeZ_GTrI&t=324.9s)]
