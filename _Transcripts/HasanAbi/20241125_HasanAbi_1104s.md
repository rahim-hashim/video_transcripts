# Why Americans Hate Each Other Now | Hasanabi Reacts to Wisecrack
**HasanAbi:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k)
*  Now, Klein is often cited as saying, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=0.0s)]
*  love is not just admiration for strength, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1.6s)]
*  there's also tolerance for weakness. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=3.2s)]
*  Babies are s***phrenic, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=4.96s)]
*  conservatives have baby brain, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=6.48s)]
*  equals conservatives are s***phrenic, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=8.4s)]
*  paranoid s***phrenics, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=10.64s)]
*  in the way that they analyze [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=12.08s)]
*  and contend with their love-hate relationship with others. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=14.32s)]
*  That's my takeaway. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=17.12s)]
*  All right, why Americans hate each other now? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=23.84s)]
*  Okay guys, confession time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=25.92s)]
*  Well, I think of myself as a pretty moral person, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=27.68s)]
*  you know, I've studied ethics for a lot of my life. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=30.4s)]
*  I once did something that was truly horrible. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=33.12s)]
*  I ghosted someone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=35.28s)]
*  Now, things with this person have been going great, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  you know, we had a lot in common, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=40.08s)]
*  they were really nice and most importantly, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=41.2s)]
*  she said it was cute that I was going bald on our first date. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=43.6s)]
*  I see you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=46.8s)]
*  This ain't no, oh I see you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=47.6s)]
*  But then after seeing her a few times, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=49.28s)]
*  something really horrible happened. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=50.56s)]
*  I was watching college basketball [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=51.68s)]
*  and then she turned off my TV [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=52.8s)]
*  and then turned on some form of pop-punk music [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=54.32s)]
*  on her iPhone and said, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=57.12s)]
*  let's just listen to music instead. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=58.32s)]
*  And at that moment, it was over for me. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  I had lost that loving feeling. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=61.44s)]
*  And I imagine in the recent weeks, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  some of us might've been tempted to do some ghosting of our own. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=64.56s)]
*  Because in the wake of a really contentious election, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=67.44s)]
*  a lot of people seem unable to deal with the fact [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=69.52s)]
*  that folks who they liked, that they thought were good, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=71.6s)]
*  then voted for someone whose overall vibe rhymes with smashes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=74.16s)]
*  And it's not just happening with personal relationships, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  as folks have been blaming entire populations [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=78.88s)]
*  for their complicity in Trump's election. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=80.88s)]
*  Posts like this are going viral, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  implying that people in Flint, Michigan, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  deserve lead in their water [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=86.08s)]
*  because their county turned up red on an electoral map. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=87.76s)]
*  Which leads me to ask, what is going on here? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=90.16s)]
*  How can people disown their family members [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=92.4s)]
*  and wish ecological harm on entire cities? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=94.64s)]
*  You know, ghost environmental lawyers who like bald guys. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=96.56s)]
*  These situations all treat reality [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=99.28s)]
*  like a simple matrix of good or bad, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=100.96s)]
*  moral or immoral, future, wife or eternal enemy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=102.56s)]
*  And ideally, we would see that reality is more complex [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=105.2s)]
*  or nuanced than these black and white reactions. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=108.08s)]
*  You could put half of Trump supporters [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=110.16s)]
*  into what I call the baskets. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=112.24s)]
*  And that we can't separate voting patterns [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=113.52s)]
*  from underlying economic and social conditions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=115.2s)]
*  Or, you know, realize that liking hot topic music [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  doesn't make you one worthy of love. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so today we're gonna try to understand all of this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=120.08s)]
*  via the psychoanalytic concept [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  of the paranoid schizoid position. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=124.08s)]
*  And I think if we understand the psychoanalytic concept, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  not only will we better understand our own minds, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=127.76s)]
*  but it can help us understand what's going on societally [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=130.24s)]
*  when we're all falling into this sort of black and white thinking. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=132.72s)]
*  And even help us understand how we can avoid it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=135.12s)]
*  But before we get into it, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=137.2s)]
*  I wanna give a shout out to this video sponsor, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=138.16s)]
*  Private Internet Access. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=139.84s)]
*  Now, Private Internet Access is a VPN. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=141.04s)]
*  In case you don't know what that is, I'll tell you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=143.12s)]
*  So whenever you're browsing online, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=144.48s)]
*  your device is transmitting a ton of information, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=145.76s)]
*  which can be viewed by hackers or anyone looking to make money [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  off of your personal data. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=149.92s)]
*  Now, a VPN, a virtual private network, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=151.04s)]
*  helps you keep your data secure while you're browsing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  Think about it this way, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  You wouldn't go to the beach without... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=155.12s)]
*  Yes, it's sped up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=156.48s)]
*  ...putting on sunscreen because you know you'd get burned. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=157.76s)]
*  And in this case, having a VPN is like a bunch of SPF [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=160.0s)]
*  that protects your data and internet activity. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  And I'm a huge fan of VPNs, not just for safety, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=164.16s)]
*  but for fun stuff too. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=166.16s)]
*  Like, did you know that Netflix has different things [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=167.2s)]
*  in different countries? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=169.28s)]
*  Sometimes shows... [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=169.92s)]
*  I'm doing ethical reacts, chat, shut up. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=171.04s)]
*  We don't get here, but with Private Internet Access, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  I can just... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=175.76s)]
*  Also subscribe to the broadcast. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  I retain the right to serve ads in the future if I feel like it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=179.6s)]
*  And you can avoid those future ads [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=183.76s)]
*  and be able to send me links and use emotes [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  and support the broadcast. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=188.16s)]
*  You can just go on a global journey and tell the internet, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=189.76s)]
*  I'm in a bunch of different places [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=192.0s)]
*  and see what sort of cool shows and movies pop up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=193.04s)]
*  And even better, Private Internet Access is not just for your computer. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  For the fun of it to sub. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=197.44s)]
*  It's available on a ton of different devices [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  and on all platforms, including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android, and iOS. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=199.2s)]
*  You wouldn't go to the beach without putting on sunscreen [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=203.84s)]
*  as double internet is not protecting them for 80 a month. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=205.68s)]
*  Stay safe when you're on the internet [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=208.64s)]
*  and check out Private Internet Access today. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=210.24s)]
*  But for now, let's get back to the show. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=212.32s)]
*  Okay, so let's start with an example to understand this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=213.76s)]
*  Imagine you just had a fight with your best friend [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=216.16s)]
*  because they said something like, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=217.76s)]
*  the Grateful Dead is noodley crap music [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=219.28s)]
*  for hippies who smell like dumpsters outside of a dispensary. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  At first, you might be incensed at their sheer stupidity. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=223.84s)]
*  But after you have a second to chill out, you realize [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=226.32s)]
*  you don't really like their preferred music either. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=228.4s)]
*  Techno that sounds like how bad drugs feel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=230.4s)]
*  And honestly, who cares? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=232.24s)]
*  Because they're a fiercely loyal, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  There ain't no way he's talking shit about Fred again. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Deeply empathetic friend. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=237.12s)]
*  Go back, Seth! I'm going to Mordor alone. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=238.24s)]
*  Of course you are. And I'm coming with you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  So, you know, if they don't want to listen to old dead shows with you on road trips, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=242.8s)]
*  who cares? They're still your friend. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  Congratulations. By going on that journey, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=246.88s)]
*  you've just traveled through the paranoid schizoid vortex [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  and reached the depressive position. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=250.56s)]
*  Who among us hasn't been in the depressive position recently? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=252.4s)]
*  For me, it's sort of curled up like that, but still holding a bottle of beer. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, these terms aren't really about schizophrenia or depression. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=257.92s)]
*  They're how psychoanalyst Melanie Klein describes a process in human psychology. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=260.64s)]
*  Where we move from black and white ways of thinking to more integrated ways of thinking. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=263.84s)]
*  One where two things can be true at once. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=268.0s)]
*  Now in the former, your initial anger and disgust towards your friend's ignorance about, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=269.68s)]
*  you know, jam bands could lead to dramatic conclusions. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=272.96s)]
*  Begone, vile man! Begone from me! [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=275.28s)]
*  Like you deciding your friend is unworthy of your company. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=277.36s)]
*  But in the depressive position, you're able to consider both yourself and your friend as separate, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=279.76s)]
*  whole people who have mixes of both lovable and hateable qualities. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=284.24s)]
*  One hateable quality I have is I hate sharing dishes at restaurants when people you watch [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=287.28s)]
*  at dinner and someone's like, oh, you want to get this and I'll get that and we'll just share it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=290.08s)]
*  I'm like, no. Okay. So once you go through this, your focus turns to repairing the rupture [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=292.4s)]
*  and then deepening your love and understanding for your friend and potentially yourself. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's a process that helps us better access the depths of our own humanity. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=299.28s)]
*  And incidentally, a process that seemed increasingly rare, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=302.64s)]
*  at least over here in the good old United States of America. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=304.8s)]
*  Now we all experienced the transition from paranoid schizoid to depressive position. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  Some more than others. But it's not like after you reach that depressive position, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=315.28s)]
*  you're set for life. You know, it's a cycle that repeats. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=318.32s)]
*  We often return to the paranoid schizoid position in response to threats or moments of stress. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=320.4s)]
*  But if we stay there too long, it leads us to major black and white thinking, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  which doesn't really do much to honor anyone's complexity or the complexity of the world around us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=328.4s)]
*  So how did Klein develop this theory in the first place? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=332.48s)]
*  Well, in the early 20th century, she was working with young children and she observed that to cope [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  with the trauma of being born, as well as early confusing and painful experiences of existing in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=338.56s)]
*  the world, children defend themselves via something called splitting. Shout out for anyone else who [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=342.64s)]
*  heard the phrase the trauma of being born and just stopped and was like, oh, man, that's some [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=346.24s)]
*  real stuff right there. Now, in this process, parts of themselves and others become perceived [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=350.0s)]
*  as either all good or all bad because babies struggle to comprehend how someone could, I don't [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  know, have horrible taste in music and still be a good person. And this leads them to separate [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  loving feelings from aggressive feelings. Aggression is just part of human nature. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=360.32s)]
*  Basically, human beings have loving feelings and aggressive feelings. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  And this schizoid instinct encourages us to put a lot of effort into separating good from bad and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=367.92s)]
*  love from hate. For example, babies experience hunger, but they don't really understand what [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=371.76s)]
*  hunger is or where that's coming from. All they know is that they're in pain and this sucks. But [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=375.28s)]
*  then you give them some milk and they feel better. So they associate the breast or the bottle with [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  goodness. And now the world is fundamentally OK. But of course, babies also have really bad [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=382.4s)]
*  experiences, you know, because the breast is not a vending machine and it might not instantly produce [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=386.0s)]
*  the milk necessary to cure their hunger. When this happens, it can terrify a baby, leading them to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=390.08s)]
*  see the breast as cruel, terrible and all bad for withholding. So like basically, when you think [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  about it, babies are all kind of incels at a certain point. This rage might lead the baby to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=398.32s)]
*  bite the breast, attacking it because they feel punished, or maybe it might make them just deny [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=402.0s)]
*  the milk as a way of rejecting their dependence on it. So there's kind of a psychological sleight [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=405.28s)]
*  of hand in which people manage to see aggression in other people, but not in themselves. That gets [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=409.28s)]
*  to what we call the paranoid schizoid position. Now, as the baby grows, they ideally experience [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=417.84s)]
*  enough positivity and goodness to start to build a central core on which to begin to integrate the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=421.52s)]
*  contracting aspects of the self. And in psychoanalytic terms, this is called forming a good internal [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=425.92s)]
*  object. But if there haven't been enough good or loving experiences, then they'll continue to see [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=430.72s)]
*  everyone through the lens of extremes, you know, potential sources of their persecution, like the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=434.24s)]
*  breast, they'll struggle to integrate their experiences into a whole. They'll experience [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=438.24s)]
*  everyone and everything is out to get them unless they get them first. Now there you have the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  paranoid piece. And when you put this all together, you get the paranoid schizoid. Along this [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=446.48s)]
*  developmental trajectory, if the person builds that good internal object, they are likely to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  reach the depressive position. And I know that reaching a depressive position probably doesn't [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=454.72s)]
*  sound like a good thing, but this is actually the state where complexity and individuation prevail, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=458.24s)]
*  where goodness and badness exist in everyone and everything, the self included. You know, for [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=462.96s)]
*  example, as the baby gets older, they may realize that the caregiver behind the breast or bottle [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=466.96s)]
*  has a lot of other things to. Sure, they're supposed to feed and nourish you, and hopefully [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=470.24s)]
*  you can count on them to do so, but they won't always come at the exact moment that you desire [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=473.36s)]
*  food. And you start to see them as a mix between good and bad. Start to reconcile your hate with [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=477.68s)]
*  your love. You feel guilty for the times you bit them or refuse them, and you seek to repair. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=482.32s)]
*  You ponder your dependence. You face your annihilation anxiety and start to grow up [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=486.24s)]
*  and figure out ways to feed yourself and others. You know, you learn to feel real love. Now, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  Klein is often cited as saying, love is not just admiration for strength. There's also tolerance [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=493.68s)]
*  for weakness. Babies are schizophrenic. Conservatives have baby brain equals conservatives are [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=497.68s)]
*  schizophrenic, paranoid schizophrenics in the way that they analyze and contend with their love hate [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=503.2s)]
*  relationship with others. That's my takeaway. Both in others and in the self. But again, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=509.36s)]
*  it's not like anyone ever overcomes the paranoid schizoid phase and graduates into a perv. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=513.84s)]
*  Rather, Klein saw these positions as transient states of mind. The paranoid schizoid, for instance, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  defends against the depressive and especially in times of stress can even be useful. You know, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  someone's trying to break into your house with a big knife. Do you want to be in the depressive [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=526.72s)]
*  state and be like, well, technically the person breaking into my house with a knife, they may have [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  gone through some stuff in their childhood that led them to this position and boom, you're stabbed. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=532.0s)]
*  If you were in another position, you would just be like, holy s***, knife guy, all bad, me all good, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=535.12s)]
*  going to live by. However, it can also signify a moment of regression or stunted state of [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=538.88s)]
*  development. In other words, when life gets really stressful and scary, we all start thinking like [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=542.96s)]
*  babies. Even though we're talking about a psychological phenomenon, the paranoid schizoid [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  process has direct social effects and many have applied Klein's framework to better understand [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=550.1600000000001s)]
*  American history and culture. Okay, so, you know, let's go back to the beginning when the land that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=554.8000000000001s)]
*  we now call the Americas was discovered by colonists. And at the time it was also already [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=558.0s)]
*  very much occupied by human beings. But the colonizers, right, they constructed a narrative [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=562.96s)]
*  about this new world, this new, amazing, all good place. Good Europeans could go to start a fresh [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  and glorious life and any threat to their idealized narrative, such as the presence of native [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=572.0s)]
*  people, threaten their story and therefore had to be all bad. It of course helped that they had God [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=576.08s)]
*  on their side to convince them that they were the good ones. To uphold this tenuous narrative, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=580.64s)]
*  they employed a paranoid schizoid position to rationalize their domination and annihilation [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=583.6s)]
*  of native people in their land. Now human beings have a conscience and thus we have the capacity [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=587.6s)]
*  to feel guilty for harming others in the environment. But the paranoid schizoid position is super good [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=591.04s)]
*  at staving off that guilt and it's good at finding reasons and systems to rationalize [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=595.68s)]
*  unconscionable behavior. You know, that's how we get things like white supremacy and homophobia, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=599.36s)]
*  the free market, you name it. We see paranoid schizoid metaphors in contemporary politics when [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=603.36s)]
*  it comes to stuff like the border wall and immigration. Now here the focus is on maintaining [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=607.52s)]
*  a narrative of natural Americans as being all good and migrants as being so they're not even human. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=610.96s)]
*  Build that wall, build that wall, build that wall, build that wall. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=615.76s)]
*  Any nuance disappears, like say, considering that actually the U.S. government has aided and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=620.08s)]
*  abetted dictatorships, genocides and the massive extraction of natural resources and many of those [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=624.32s)]
*  migrants countries of origins thus making life there increasingly untenable. No, we don't have time for that. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=628.56s)]
*  Bro, who are you? Check logs. Hey Sammy, I'm the one the server is made for. What server? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=633.52s)]
*  Check DMs on Insta and Patreon. What are you saying, dude? What is going on today? Sort of thinking. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  Let me be clear, contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=647.1199999999999s)]
*  what's happening is not genocide. And this all exemplifies the paranoid schizoid split between [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  good guys and bad guys. And our media history and social systems are just filled with this way of [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=655.6s)]
*  thinking. You know that there are simply- Bro, I literally get like 10 million DMs a day. How the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=659.36s)]
*  f*** would I be able to find a DM that you sent me at 11 a.m. It's crazy. Good and bad people, like it's [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  an inherent quality. I'll be honest, I struggled with this so much when I was younger. You get one guy easily, it's true, I do. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=671.84s)]
*  I've been politically idealistic for most of my life and when I started to get idealistic, I struggled with thinking like [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  everyone who believes the good stuff is good and anyone else is bad and it's just not a really [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=680.08s)]
*  productive way to live. Now while anyone is capable of doing something good or bad, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=682.88s)]
*  that doesn't mean they're bad or good at a fundamental level. Like a murderer could hold a door open for you [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=686.08s)]
*  and doesn't make them fundamentally good. Okay, so consider the carceral system. Imagine that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=690.16s)]
*  someone gets charged with a crime, right? They steal a TV and then get sent to jail. A paranoid [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=694.48s)]
*  schizoid stance would immediately punish this person and call her then is all bad, deserving [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=698.08s)]
*  of punishment. Doesn't consider outside influences and in doing so, it defends against a depressive [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=702.24s)]
*  position, which would interrogate what conditions might have led someone to do a bad thing. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=706.72s)]
*  So you were always like this. Now a depressive position would look at the context that led the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=710.96s)]
*  accused to this point, you know, such as poverty. And this is how we start to justify extremes like [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=715.36s)]
*  the death penalty. By prioritizing punishment over empathy, self-reflection, and rehabilitation, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=719.2800000000001s)]
*  people in power use paranoid schizoid thinking to justify the status quo. But there's no evidence. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=723.2800000000001s)]
*  A video came out of a migrant 30 miles away eating a cat. Now many historians have actually [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=727.36s)]
*  traced the death penalty back to lynchings and the enslavement of black people. You know, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=732.1600000000001s)]
*  it's not a coincidence that the group brought here and enslaved against their will is most [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=735.84s)]
*  likely to be identified as all bad and deserving of annihilation. You know, it's easier to think [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=740.08s)]
*  that you're a good Christian slave owner when you come up with a narrative in which the enslaved [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=744.72s)]
*  person isn't really a person. You know, dehumanizing your perceived enemy is a highly effective way of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  staving off guilt for your wrongdoing or that of your ancestors. So psychoanalysts have actually [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=753.44s)]
*  linked racism to the paranoid schizoid position. A 2021 article by psychoanalyst, Ebony Dennis, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=758.4000000000001s)]
*  applies the paranoid schizoid position to white supremacy and draws a parallel between the baby's [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=763.12s)]
*  annihilation anxiety and dependence on the mother and the colonial white self's annihilation anxiety [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=767.6s)]
*  and dependence on the black slave owner. She postulates that whiteness was created in order [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=771.9200000000001s)]
*  to distance white people from the racialized other, thereby holding whiteness as all good and then sort [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=775.6800000000001s)]
*  of staving off guilt for oppressing the all bad object. No, I'm not saying white people aren't [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  evil either because I know we're evil. I got that evil in me. And to be clear, the object here is [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=783.76s)]
*  just a person, just a human being. But of course, while white people exploited and enslaved black [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=787.52s)]
*  people, they were also dependent on them for providing free labor. You know, they needed them [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=791.0400000000001s)]
*  to work rather than, you know, escape or rebel. And so enslaving people then staved off their [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=794.24s)]
*  fears of not being able to survive in an unfamiliar land. So even in a story of dominator and enslaved [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=798.8s)]
*  in which we don't see a lot of interdependence, there was still an incredible amount of dependency. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=804.72s)]
*  You know, one dominated the other to stave off fears of being dominated either by the other or by [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=809.2s)]
*  environmental conditions. And Dennis argues that these dynamics persist today through [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=813.76s)]
*  intergenerational transmission such that if the oppressed doesn't fulfill the needs of the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=817.92s)]
*  oppressor, be they physical or psychological, the oppressor continues to oppress in order to [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=822.4s)]
*  restore psychological equilibrium and maintain the status quo. If you guys want to know more [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=827.04s)]
*  about this, I recommend the work of France Fanon. We've talked about him in a few recent videos. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=830.64s)]
*  He's a philosopher and psychiatrist that really, really gets at the psychology of colonization and [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=833.76s)]
*  how it affects both the colonizer and the colonized subject. His book, Black Skin, White Mask, is [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=838.24s)]
*  really good on this. So do check out Fanon if you have not already. Now, Dennis argues that, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=842.64s)]
*  paradoxically, this process also oppresses the oppressor. Quote, the intoxicating influence of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=846.24s)]
*  whiteness creates a vapid space in which thinking is impeded, defended against. Such defense [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=851.76s)]
*  structures obscure the ability to accurately perceive reality and up until recently have [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=855.84s)]
*  stifled curiosity about the psychological impact of slavery on whites. And this split between good [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=860.16s)]
*  and bad also produces a split in the self where weak and needy parts are unintegrated and strength [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=865.04s)]
*  is hollowly celebrated, coalescing in a vulnerable egoism. I mean, to think about this in more [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=870.4s)]
*  contemporary, dudish terms, it's sort of like being strong and is good and having emotions is bad, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=875.12s)]
*  being an alpha is good and being a little beta is bad, that sort of stuff. And these stories of [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=881.0400000000001s)]
*  superiority not only continue to oppress the racialized other, but also unfairly pressure [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=884.88s)]
*  white men and people in general to attempt to fulfill this perceived legacy of dominance and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=888.72s)]
*  superiority in all areas and can lead to feelings of inferiority if they do not. I feel like this [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=892.72s)]
*  explains a lot of the weird stuff in the Manosphere and areas of this website where men have some [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  pretty weird ideas. I don't know what the opposite of a shout out is, but opposite shout out, Andrew [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=901.6800000000001s)]
*  Tate. Big opposite ups to Andrew Tate. And this split hurts everyone in different ways because [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=906.64s)]
*  it is not truly reflective of the human condition, which again, as Klein would say, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=911.28s)]
*  is a mix of weakness and strength, love and hate, goodness and badness. If the paranoid schizoid [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=914.4799999999999s)]
*  position can be used to understand how some very bad stuff like racism, colonialism and political [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=921.68s)]
*  divisions are upheld, well, then, you know, maybe we can use it to understand our own lives. And [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=926.4799999999999s)]
*  maybe that'll help us to solve some of our biggest societal problems. And we've said this before, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=932.08s)]
*  but let me just emphasize again, it's not that we're trying to avoid this, right? The paranoid [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=936.4000000000001s)]
*  schizoid position at the level of our individual development is unavoidable. You know, we don't [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=939.5200000000001s)]
*  have to be ashamed of it. It emerges to help us grapple with scary and unfamiliar things, but it's [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  not our final destination. It's a process that we work through and we can even see the paranoid [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=948.72s)]
*  schizoid position as an invitation to arrive at the more integrated depressive position. And because [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=952.4000000000001s)]
*  this is all happening internally, we're not necessarily cursed to repeat the psychological [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=957.2s)]
*  patterns at the social and political level. So in that sense, what I'm saying is the position [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=961.12s)]
*  isn't all bad, right? It is a natural thing at one level, but it can become a very bad thing when [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=965.52s)]
*  projected outwards onto others. And again, we need it to avoid complete overwhelm. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=969.6s)]
*  You know, in the face of like mortality and you're going to lose people and financial struggles and [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=973.28s)]
*  all of these things that are so unknown, to have some security, you know, I think probably is very [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=978.24s)]
*  seductive. In moments of stress and anger, we look for security and certainty, you know? Sometimes we [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=984.8s)]
*  do need a concrete yes or no, and we can worry about moving onto the depressive position later. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=989.28s)]
*  We all subscribe to some kind of narrative of what makes sense in the world. Maybe there is [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=993.8399999999999s)]
*  no sense in the world. We all have to either create it or be nihilistic. So this thinking [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=998.64s)]
*  can offer security so long as we can eventually interrogate it and think about where it's coming [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1002.24s)]
*  from. Here's what my buddy Frank Yeoman has to say. It's extremely comforting to think we're the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1006.16s)]
*  good ones, the others are the bad. I think the challenge to society is one of education. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1011.12s)]
*  How can we educate people to not shy away from complexity? How can we educate people to embrace [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1016.24s)]
*  it and appreciate it rather than be threatened by it? And this, of course, all plays back into the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1022.96s)]
*  political tensions that folks are feeling right here in post-election America, where various [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1027.2s)]
*  demographics are just being thrown under the bus for being the bad guys who ruined it for the good [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1031.44s)]
*  guys. And here, I think one final comment from Yeoman will be helpful. The trick is to have that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1035.52s)]
*  fervent energy and not totally vilify the other to be able to maintain some empathy with the other, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1040.48s)]
*  to understand the other's position. Because once it's all vilification, the dialogue breaks down. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1046.56s)]
*  So guys, not to be too corny, but it really does feel like we're in a time where empathy and [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1052.56s)]
*  curiosity and dialogue are going to be a lot more useful than whatever else it is we've been trying. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1057.2s)]
*  And if we can access those feelings by just embracing a weird part of our own psychology, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1061.76s)]
*  then hey, to me, that seems like a good thing. Now, in the meantime, don't stay in the depressive [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1065.68s)]
*  state for too long. And please let me know what you think in the comments, especially if you have [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1070.0s)]
*  stories about times that you ghosted or were ghosted. A special shout out to all of our [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1073.6s)]

*  And in the meantime, remember that cursing an entire county of people to drink water that's [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1084.8s)]
*  poisoned with lead just because you don't like who a majority of them voted for makes you bad, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1089.28s)]
*  all the way bad. Sorry, that's one exception to the rule. I agree. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1092.88s)]
*  Let me tell you what I also agree on though. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXcdt7653k&t=1100.0s)]
