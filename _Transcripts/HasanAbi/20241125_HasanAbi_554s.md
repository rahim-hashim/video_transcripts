*  Crowder in drag. 13 million views. I don't know how to like expand on the metrics. I [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  want to see. I want to see like what his overall views look like versus now. I think political [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=152.42000000000002s)]

*  expand on it. Pocket watching. I mean, it's not even pocket watching. It's like shocking. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=169.62s)]
*  I think it's shocking to see someone who was such a massive content creator on the right [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=173.74s)]
*  fall off of a cliff. Ben Shapiro's experienced similar things as well. I think that there [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=180.86s)]
*  is more. I think honestly, here's the thing. You want to know what I think is going on? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=185.18s)]
*  I think there's so much right wing content out there that it's cannibalizing because [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=190.58s)]
*  a lot of people would rather a lot of people I think would rather view like Manasphere [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  guys shit. A lot of people would rather view Manasphere guys talk about like all the culture [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  war stuff that these guys also used to talk about. Then watch like Ben Shapiro's nerdy [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=209.38s)]
*  ass. It's oversaturated. The market is oversaturated. And, and that's the reason why people I think [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  would rather see, you know, they would rather watch as mingle talk about the finer points [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=222.85999999999999s)]
*  of, of conservative cultural critique, right? That's what it is. The dumbing down of modern [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=228.42s)]
*  games. Ellen try to make a comeback. It's not going well. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=234.66s)]
*  Elon Musk wants to buy MSNBC. Jaguar just made a huge mistake. Like look at that. His Jaguar [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=238.54s)]
*  made a huge mistake has 2753,000 views in one day. Steven Crowder's Jaguar video had [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=244.38s)]
*  a hundred thousand hundred fifty three thousand views. I think Asmongold is, is infinitely [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=251.98s)]
*  more successful as a right wing content creator than Steven Crowder. What is this interest [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=257.34s)]
*  over time? He peaked. Yeah. When he was doing the and that's the 50 mil moment. But like [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=262.86s)]
*  the past five years, let's say, or the past year, maybe like past two years is better [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=269.34s)]
*  or past four years. Let's do what is this? The old right wing grift is fear is dying [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=276.78s)]
*  and oversaturated. The slop manosphere is here. Yeah. I think if I think for a lot of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  people, they would much rather watch someone who's always been, who's always been doing [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=287.17999999999995s)]
*  right. Adjacent commentary on specifically on specifically like cultural issues and doesn't [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=293.02s)]
*  have like an immediate political focus and doesn't care about like the annoying politics [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=303.78s)]
*  of it all. Like Asmongold does not know the names of like right wing senators, Republican [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=308.34s)]
*  senators, you know what I mean? He doesn't know. And for him, it's like, this is a much [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=314.06s)]
*  better him in comparison to like a Ben Shapiro. Ben Shapiro is too nerdy, cares too much about [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=320.06s)]
*  the ideological project of the Republican party and not enough about like the silly [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=325.5s)]
*  content slop of like, you know, what media is liberal and therefore gay and bad. You [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=328.94s)]
*  know what I mean? The person I think that bridges that gap of like at least having some [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=335.54s)]
*  knowledge of right wing policies and doing that, but still doing mostly cultural commentaries [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=340.22s)]
*  like Patrick bet David. Yeah. People can now instead just watch their favorite gamers play [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=348.14s)]
*  while spitting Sigma male and raw milk type talk talking points and sprinkling some right [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=356.14s)]
*  wing talking points on top. Much better graph. I mean, yeah, of course I'm dominating Steven [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=359.9s)]
*  Crowder. He has no motion. He has no motion whatsoever. Let's put Ben Shapiro on there [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  too. Let's see how that Ben Shapiro still cooks me. Holy shit. His view counts have diminished [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  as well though. As we know some rough takes lately, but I don't think of him as agenda driven [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=376.78s)]
*  like I do Ben and Steve. No, he is the, his agenda is not, you know, defending the Republican [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=381.02s)]
*  party. His agenda is like defending right wing sentiment more than anything else. It doesn't [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=387.17999999999995s)]
*  translate to Google trends. Like his peak, this comes from when he got banned. Okay. This is all, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  this is all stuff like this is all people Google searching him when they get, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=397.34s)]
*  uh, when they, when they get like some level of prominence, like a lot of my peaks also come from [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=401.18s)]
*  the news articles that have been written about me at the same timeframe. You know what I mean? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=408.3s)]
*  Here, like that's why I, I have these peaks as well. But overall, if you look at, I think [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=413.09999999999997s)]
*  has been gold only defense has been gold takes. He has the right of center lean, but doesn't see [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=418.78s)]
*  malicious. No, the dude it's, I don't think these are firmly held convictions that he has. Okay. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=422.46s)]
*  I think this gives them, I think this gives Asmongold a tremendous amount of relevance. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=429.26s)]
*  And he likes that he likes that more than anything else. And that's why he, look, when he has 40,000 [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=433.58s)]
*  viewers talking about right wing shit and his YouTube channels are popping with like a million [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  views a day, he's going to keep doing it. It's not because he legitimately is like, I am, uh, you [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=446.53999999999996s)]
*  know, he's not legitimately invested in the success of the Republican party or anything like that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=452.94s)]
*  It's more simple than that. He gets a lot of views and he likes that. That's it. It's a meta. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=457.74s)]
*  Okay. That's it. He's meta chasing and the meta is, you know, being kind of right wing and it's [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=463.26s)]
*  easy to farm right wingers. That's it. Minder Hassan is the son of a Turkish billionaire, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=470.22s)]
*  20,000 likes. This is not true. That's amazing. Just an incredibly factually inaccurate statement, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=475.98s)]
*  but everyone believes it. That's amazing. The amount of times I've heard that is insane, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=484.22s)]
*  by the way. Yes, brother or sister. It just doesn't matter. People we've already established [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=488.78000000000003s)]
*  that narrative is more important than the truth. And it, and it's a great narrative to just be like, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=494.22s)]
*  nah, this is a rich Nepal baby. Asmol doesn't even use the money he makes. Yeah. That's what I'm [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=499.58000000000004s)]
*  saying. He doesn't care about the money as much. He cares about being popular, I think. And that's [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=509.5s)]
*  where it comes from. I don't think he's like personally as invested in the right-wing project [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=513.5s)]
*  or a right-wing ideology. He's not like, Ooh, let me talk about DEI and woke in games, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=518.14s)]
*  ruining video games. Like he might, that might actually be one aspect of, of his commentary. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=525.42s)]
*  That's like kind of real, like genuine. He might, you know, he might be mis-attributing [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=530.86s)]
*  the end shitification of every industry, including, including gaming, mis-attributing [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=536.54s)]
*  what is like classic rich netpo second to Sharpio. What? Why does it matter who your dad is? Anyway, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=542.94s)]
*  the stuff you talk about doesn't even help you Lamau. I know, but it's just a false hood. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuE5KahtB0M&t=549.5s)]
